      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality on a triangular Rydberg array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct ordered phases -- so-called Deconfined Quantum Critical points (DQCPs) -- which lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition between two ordered phases at 1/3 and at 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233 (2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1) symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically. Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Improved Constant in Quantum Solution Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have provided an algorithm to extract a smooth and positive definite function $\psi(x)$ encoded in quantum memory of size $2^n$ without running into the problem of exponentially suppressed sub-normalization. Through this, we remove an important bottleneck of solution information extraction, the last step, in fully solving an important class of differential equations on quantum computers. This class of problems includes solutions to the heat equation or other diffusive equations in fluid dynamics and finance.</description>

      <title>Derivation from classical Majorana--Bloch equation to quantum von Neumann equation for any angular momenta in coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After publishing the derivation from the classical Bloch equation to the quantum von Neumann equation to the Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation for spin-1/2, we proposed renaming the Bloch equation to the Majorana--Bloch equation because Majorana's work predated Bloch's in the presentation of the Bloch equation by 14 years. Here, we generalize our previous derivation to higher spins or angular momenta in coherent pure states. Using the polynomial representation of the coherent-state projector, we derive an invertible mapping from the Majorana--Bloch equation to the von Neumann equation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between these two formalisms. Application of the Ehrenfest theorem also shows that expectation values in these states reproduce the classical equation of motion.</description>

      <title>Cold atomic ensembles as quantum antennas for distributed networks of single-atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for high-fidelity quantum computing at local nodes. Nonetheless, creating entanglement between remote nodes in a distributed quantum network remains challenging due to inherently weak atom-light coupling. Here, we design a distributed quantum network architecture in which cold atomic ensembles with strong atom-light interactions act as quantum antennas, interfacing single-atom qubits with flying photons to enable high-efficiency atom-photon entanglement generation -- analogous to the role of antennas in classical communication. Using realistic experimental parameters, we estimate an efficiency of $\eta \simeq 0.548$ for generating atom-photon entanglement, a probability of $P_{E} \simeq 6 \%$ for generating atom-atom entanglement, and a remote entanglement generation rate of $16.6 $ kHz. This performance not only surpasses that of state-of-the-art cavity-based or high-numerical-aperture-lens-based architectures but also offers notable advantages in simplicity, tunability, and experimental accessibility. Our scheme also integrates a long-lived quantum memory, providing a storage advantage for quantum repeater design. By leveraging the complementary strengths of single-atom qubits for local operations and cold atomic ensembles for networking, this approach paves the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and sensing.</description>

      <title>From free-evolution to tomographic representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the free evolution propagator to determine the quantum probability representation (i.e., the general expression of the tomogram) of any one-dimensional system described by a density state. The evolution operator for the considered quantum system is additionally used to establish the corresponding time dependent tomogram. Applications are given for a Gaussian wave packet, the quantum shutter related with the phenomenon of diffraction in time, the double quantum shutter, and a finite potential. A generalisation to describe $N$ particle systems is also presented and, in particular, we find the tomogram associated to the 2 particle case occupying in general non-orthogonal states. In the latter case, for a bipartite quantum system, the entanglement properties are established by considering quantum information concepts such as the linear entropy.</description>

      <title>Single-gate, multipartite entanglement on a room-temperature quantum register</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. Two-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous control of populations and coherence phase of open two-level quantum systems with a single pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the control of the dynamics of both population and coherence phase in an open two-level quantum system employing a single external control field. The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation that takes into account dephasing and thermal noise. The control is engineered by inverting the underlying equations of motion, which yields an analytical expression for the control field in terms of user-specified time-dependent functions for the population and coherence phase. Our approach allows to dictate not only the initial and final populations and phases, but the full dynamics of these quantities. The chosen functions for population and phase have to conform to certain constraints indicated in our analysis. Our methodology also reveals the possible transitions for given initial conditions and environmental noise parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum thermodynamics aims to elucidate the role played by quantum principles in the emergent features of quantum thermodynamic processes. Specifically, it is of fundamental importance to understand how quantum correlation among different parties enables thermodynamic features distinguishable from those arising in classical thermodynamics. In this work, we investigate the relation between extractable work and quantum correlations for two-mode Gaussian states. We examine the change in local energy occurring at one party due to a Gaussian measurement performed on the other in relation to the quantum correlations of two-mode states classified as separable, entangled, and steerable states. Our analysis reveals a clear quantitative difference in the extractable work, depending on the class of states to which the two-mode state belongs.</description>

      <title>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catering to emerging satellite-based free-space optical (FSO) communication networks and exploiting polarization encoding via Stokes operators, we propose a novel simultaneous quantum-classical communications (SQCC) protocol. The protocol enables the coexistence of secure quantum communications and high-throughput classical communications with minimal alterations in both the infrastructure and the energy input. Compared to the conventional SQCC protocol, our new approach provides superior practicality in the real world, eliminates the need for a separate local oscillator, and allows for the simple readout of both quantum and classical information using direct detection. The protocol also minimizes the undesirable interplay between the quantum and the classical parts of communication. We provide a detailed mathematical formulation of the protocol, along with theoretical and numerical analysis of its performance, illustrating a promising path to practical and effective realization of combined classical-quantum communications</description>

      <title>Detecting Entanglement via Split Spectroscopy in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is recognized as a fundamental resource in quantum information processing and is essential for understanding quantum many-body physics. However, experimentally detecting entanglement, particularly in many-particle quantum states, remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose split spectroscopy as an experimentally feasible technique for detecting entanglement of eigenstates in quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate the split spectroscopy exhibits a single delta-function peak if and only if the investigated eigenstate is triseparable. Our framework is illustrated using two paradigmatic spin models that undergo quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, we show that the spectral entropy serves as a powerful indicator of quantum phase transitions and captures the scaling behavior of entanglement. Finally, we present an experimental protocol using Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 50.4 km fiber using integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the fastest-growing and relatively mature technology in the field of quantum information, enabling information-theoretically secure key distribution between two remote users. Although QKD based on off-the-shelf telecom components has been validated in both laboratory and field tests, its high cost and large volume remain major obstacles to large-scale deployment. Photonic integration, featured by its compact size and low cost, offers an effective approach to addressing the above challenges faced by QKD. Here, we implement a high-performance, integrated local local oscillator continuous-variable (CV) QKD system based on an integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver. By employing a high-speed silicon photonic integrated in-phase and quadrature modulator, a low-noise and high bandwidth silicon photonic integrated heterodyne detector, and digital signal processing, our CV-QKD system achieves a symbol rate of up to 1.5625 GBaud. Furthermore, the system achieves asymptotic secret key rates of 31.05 and 5.05 Mbps over 25.8 and 50.4 km standard single-mode fiber, respectively, using an 8-phase-shift keying discrete modulation. Our integrated CV-QKD system with high symbol rate and long transmission distance pays the way for the quantum secure communication network at metropolitan area.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kennedy Receivers Enhanced CV-QKD in Turbulent Channels for Endogenous Security of Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endogenous security in next-generation wireless communication systems attracts increasing attentions in recent years. A typical solution to endogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where unconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of quantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys high secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical communication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent receivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted to the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy receiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of coherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method is used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the SKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver and homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an equivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the bit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy receiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of both BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of CD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the average transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system settings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes. Besides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver is much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of Flat-Band and All-Bands-Flat Dynamics for Tunable Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics on the flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (AFB) lattices using a digital quantum computer. By utilizing an advanced tensor network method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux per plaquette to $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing (FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA). According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced performance of exploration and exploitation which we call exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale problems with correspondingly low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Extended Parameter Shift Rules with Minimal Derivative Variance for Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts, then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR) which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts, allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate $U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words. Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.</description>

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Quantum Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity is a fundamental model for analyzing the computational power of quantum algorithms. It has played a key role in characterizing quantum speedups, from early breakthroughs such as Grover's and Simon's algorithms to more recent developments in quantum cryptography and complexity theory. This document provides a structured introduction to quantum query lower bounds, focusing on four major techniques: the hybrid method, the polynomial method, the recording method, and the adversary method. Each method is developed from first principles and illustrated through canonical problems. Additionally, the document discusses how the adversary method can be used to derive upper bounds, highlighting its dual role in quantum query complexity. The goal is to offer a self-contained exposition accessible to readers with a basic background in quantum computing, while also serving as an entry point for researchers interested in the study of quantum lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Phase Transition and Statistical Properties in Dicke-Stark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08860v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases, the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of scaling advantage on an NP-Complete problem with enhanced quantum solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage remains a key milestone in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Without rigorous complexity proofs, scaling advantage-where quantum resource requirements grow more slowly than their classical counterparts-serves as the primary indicator. However, direct applications of quantum optimization algorithms to classically intractable problems have yet to demonstrate this advantage. To address this challenge, we develop enhanced quantum solvers for the NP-complete one-in-three Boolean satisfiability problem. We propose a restricting space reduction algorithm (RSRA) that achieves optimal search space dimensionality, thereby reducing both qubits and time complexity for various quantum solvers. Extensive numerical investigations on problem instances with up to 65 variables demonstrate that our enhanced quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA)-based solvers outperform state-of-the-art classical solvers, with the QAA-based solver providing a lower bound for our method while exhibiting scaling advantage. Furthermore, we experimentally implement our enhanced solvers on a superconducting quantum processor with 13 qubits, confirming the predicted performance improvements. Collectively, our results provide empirical evidence of quantum speedup for an NP-complete problem.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms using a statistical approach. Using Gaussian function models, we identify three distinct types of BPs. The first type, which we called localized-dip BPs, occurs in landscapes that are mostly flat but contain a dip point where the gradient is large in a small region around the minimum. The second type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the localized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called everywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with almost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult. After illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend the analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two types of ans\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz. For both ans\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our statistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but found no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that everywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\"atze. Our method effectively probes landscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space, making it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To mitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the random gates generated in the ans\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function landscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an unoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and reliability of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neural quantum states for emitter dynamics in waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Mutually equi-biased bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution $q=(q_0,\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where $\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic states of a $3\times 3$ system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Petz recovery map is a fundamental protocol in quantum information theory, enabling the retrieval of quantum information lost due to noisy processes. Here, we experimentally implement the Petz recovery map on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor using the duality quantum computing (DQC) algorithm. Focusing on two paradigmatic single-qubit channels, namely phase damping and amplitude damping, we demonstrate that the recovered states closely match theoretical predictions. Our results validate the feasibility of the Petz-based recovery map in current quantum platforms and highlight its relevance for near-term error mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09041v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Weak measurement in strong laser field physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advantage of attosecond measurements is the possibility of time-resolving ultrafast quantum phenomena of electron dynamics. Many such measurements are of interferometric nature, and therefore give access to the phase. Likewise, weak measurements are intrinsically interferometric and specifically take advantage of interfering probability amplitudes, therefore encoding the phase information of the process. In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore, extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond quantum interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic analysis of non-linear driven light emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Practice in Quantum Game Theory: Optimized Implementation of the Battle of the Sexes with Error Mitigation on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09050v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing quantum game theory on real hardware is challenging due to noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity, yet such demonstrations are essential to validate theoretical predictions. We present one of the first full experimental realizations of the Battle of the Sexes game under the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework on IBM Quantum's ibm sherbrooke superconducting processor. Four quantum strategies (I, H, $R(\pi/4)$, $R(\pi)$) were evaluated across 31 entanglement values $\gamma \in [0, \pi]$ using 2048 shots per configuration, enabling a direct comparison between analytical predictions and hardware execution. To mitigate noise and variability, we introduce a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method that dynamically selects qubit pairs and optimizes routing based on real-time topology and calibration data. The analytical model forecasts up to $108\%$ payoff improvement over the classical equilibrium, and despite hardware-induced deviations, experimental results with GCM preserve the expected payoff trends within $3.5\%$-$12\%$ relative error. These findings show that quantum advantages in strategic coordination can persist under realistic NISQ conditions, providing a pathway toward practical applications of quantum game theory in multi-agent, economic, and distributed decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum computational advantage with programmable 3050-photon Gaussian boson sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09092v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take &gt; $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we simulate the behavior of photons in a laboratory experiment using a quantum computer and examine how the simulation results compare with the theoretical predictions. The experiment involves both protective and non-protective measurements. While the latter involves complete wavefunction collapse, the former combines weak interactions with a protective mechanism thereby preserving the photon wave function coherence until its final detection. The simulation gives insights as to how efficient quantum computers can be in simulating actual physical systems as the amount of computation increases.</description>

      <title>Constrained free energy minimization for the design of thermal states and stabilizer thermodynamic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total $x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.</description>

      <title>Random Party Distillation on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random party distillation refers to the process by which Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are randomly extracted from a single copy of a multipartite entangled state after multiple rounds of performing positive operator value measure operations. In this work, we propose a qubit-based implementation of a random party distillation protocol and demonstrate its efficacy on the superconducting hardware device, ibm_quebec. We demonstrate a 4-round implementation of the protocol, showing distillation rates superior (0.81 pairs/ W state) to the state of the art. Finally, we explore the dynamical properties of the protocol when implemented on superconducting hardware, and how errors introduced by mid-circuit measurements can be mitigated.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of interacting solid-state spins below the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09122v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing. However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$ ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.</description>

      <title>Instrument-based quantum resources: quantification, hierarchies and towards constructing resource theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources are certain features of the quantum world that provide advantages in certain information-theoretic, thermodynamic, or any other useful operational tasks that are outside the realm of what classical theories can achieve. Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for studying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous state-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to some extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored, instrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few notable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the classical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum states, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple parties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several instrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of information preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement preservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility preservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5) the resource theory of parallel incompatibility. Furthermore, we outline the hierarchies of these instrument-based resources and provide measures to quantify them. In short, we provide a detailed framework for several instrument-based quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-enabled realization of arbitrary two-qubit gates on moving spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Wigner representation enables the exact derivation of the atom interferometer phase, unlike the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact expression for the phase of an atomic interferometer located in a non-inertial reference frame (platform) moving along an arbitrary trajectory and with an orientation that changes arbitrarily over time is obtained. This expression takes into account precisely gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, and gravity-gradient forces, which arise during the rotation of the gravity source at a permanent rate. To achieve this result, we utilized the equations for the atomic density matrix in the Wigner representation. Starting from the exact formula, we derived three new terms in the well-known limit of small rotation angles and short interrogation time, which are attributed to the rotation and translational motion of the platform.</description>

      <title>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamonds: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamonds (NDs) introduces complexities from size, geometry, and surface effects. NVs in NDs show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and total internal reflection. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated NDs appearing brighter than deeper ones in air and provide a unified framework for realistic emission scenarios. Unlike previous models, our approach predicts wavelength-dependent escape efficiencies and position-dependent variations. This integrated model informs the design of brighter NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale dielectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the existing framework of macroscopic HHG to combine it with high-accuracy ab initio calculations for molecules as microscopic input. This approach is applied to HHG spectra exhibiting Mollow sidebands, for open shell molecules undergoing nonadiabatic dynamics. We demonstrate the details of the method and analyze how the predicted features in the microscopic HHG response unambiguously survive macroscopic response calculations, and furthermore they exhibit a interesting angular pattern in the far-field. We calculate the macroscopic harmonic spectrum by combining many single-molecule calculations at different intensities, obtained in one case from time-dependent density functional theory calculations for N+ 2 , in second case for one electron time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a 1D double well model potential. For both cases one can observe that the resulting macroscopic spectra exhibit Mollow sidebands of approximately the same intensity as the main harmonics, while being radiated at wider angles, meaning they could be isolated more easily in an experiment.</description>

      <title>A Broadband Squeezed Light Source for Table-Top Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the characterisation of one of two broadband squeezed light sources developed for the Quantum Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment, using balanced homodyne detection. QUEST consists of a pair of co-located, table-top, power-recycled Michelson interferometers designed to probe stationary space-time fluctuations. The interferometers are designed to be shot-noise limited in the frequency range from 1 to 200 MHz, and squeezed light will be employed with the goal to reduce the shot noise by 6 dB at frequencies inside the linewidth of the optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We directly observed up to 6.8 dB of squeezing and maintained at least 3 dB of squeezing across the full 100 MHz measurement bandwidth. After accounting for the dark noise contribution, the inferred squeezing level increased to 8.6 dB. Our squeezed light source is based on a hemilithic OPA with a 43.6 mm round-trip optical length and a linewidth of 138 MHz, making it the broadest-linewidth device to date among those suitable for long-term operation.</description>

      <title>Probing spin-motion coupling of two Rydberg atoms by a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>

      <title>The alloying of first-principles calculations with quasiparticle methodologies for the converged solution of the quantum many-electron states in the correlated compound Iron monoxide</title>

Abstract: Transition metal oxides belong to a genre of quantum materials essential for the exploration of theoretical methods for quantifying electronic correlation. Finding an efficient and accurate first principles method for the assertion of such physical properties is momentous for the predictive modelling of physics based thermoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Prior investigations have suggested that incorporation of the so called random phase approximation for the electronic screening interaction by adding up the electron hole pairs leads to significant improvement in the accuracy of first principle calculations. Nonetheless the method has seldom been adapted systematically for studying the properties of prototypical transition metal oxides, particularly that of the correlated compound Iron monoxide. In this work, we provide a benchmarking study of a variety of first principles methods such as the density functional theory artificially stabilized by Coulomb interactions, Hybrid functionals as well as the quasiparticle Greens function approach to self-energy interactions. A rigorous convergence of the self-consistent Dysons equations have been provided addressing the importance of initial choice of wavefunctions guided by first principles on the converged solutions and the interplay of various orbital degrees of freedom adjacent to the Fermi level. It is momentous to obtain accurate wavefunctions and many-electronic energy states for the quantification of correlation and efficient modelling of oxide interfaces for quantum applications. The study establishes the hybrid functional scheme as the optimal approach for the ideal trade-off between accuracy of the ground state wavefunctions and computational efficiency for large-scale simulations towards the efficient convergence of correlated electronic wavefunctions and low energy electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the optical response from variant InGaN nanowires emitting within the green spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive physical and optical investigation of InGaN nanowires (NWs) designed to address the challenges posed by the green gap region. We conduct a detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and optical characteristics of the NWs using characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal scanning microscopy. Notably, increasing the indium concentration causes a redshift in emission and alters the luminescence properties across different segments of NWs.
  Our findings provide valuable insight into the correlation between indium compositional nonuniformity and the optical emission properties of NWs. These insights contribute to optimizing the growth condition, color accuracy, and enhancing optical efficiency of NWs, highlighting their potential for next generation high-performance LEDs and optoelectronics devices.</description>

      <title>Automated Charge Transition Detection in Quantum Dot Charge Stability Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots require an appropriate number of electrons to function as qubits. The number of electrons is usually tuned by analyzing charge stability diagrams, in which charge transitions manifest as edges. Therefore, to fully automate qubit tuning, it is necessary to recognize these edges automatically and reliably. This paper investigates possible detection methods, describes their training with simulated data from the SimCATS framework, and performs a quantitative comparison with a future hardware implementation in mind. Furthermore, we investigated the quality of the optimized approaches on experimentally measured data from a GaAs and a SiGe qubit sample.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint realizations of higher-order squeezing operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09044v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order squeezing captures non-Gaussian features of quantum light by probing moments of the field beyond the variance, and is associated with operators involving nonlinear combinations of creation and annihilation operators. Here we study a class of operators of the form $\xi (a^\dag)^ka^l+\xi^\ast (a^\dag)^la^k+f(a^\dag a)$, which arise naturally in the analysis of higher-order quantum fluctuations. The operators are defined on the linear span of Fock states. We show that the essential self-adjointness of these operators depends on the asymptotics of the real-valued function $f(n)$ at infinity. In particular, pure higher-order squeezing operators ($k\geq3$, $l=0$, and $f(n)=0$) are not essentially self-adjoint, but adding a properly chosen term $f(a^\dag a)$, like a Kerr term, can have a regularizing effect and restore essential self-adjointness. In the non-self-adjoint regime, we compute the deficiency indices and classify all self-adjoint extensions. Our results provide a rigorous operator-theoretic foundation for modeling and interpreting higher-order squeezing in quantum optics, and reveal interesting connections with the Birkhoff-Trjitzinsky theory of asymptotic expansions for recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bicycle Codes with Low Connectivity: Minimum Distance Bounds and Hook Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of certain generalized bicycle (GB) codes beyond the reach of techniques for classical codes capable of even capturing the true minimum distance for some cases. These bounds are then applied to illustrate the existence and analyze two highly degenerate GB code families with parameters $[[d^2+1,2,d]]$ for odd $d \geq 3$ and $[[d^2,2,d]]$ for even $d \geq 4$, both having the property that each check qubit is connected to exactly four data qubits similar to surface codes. For the odd-distance family, we analyze the structure of low-weight logical Pauli operators and demonstrate the existence of a fault-tolerant logical CNOT gate between the two logical qubits, achievable through a simple relabeling of data qubits. We further construct a syndrome extraction pattern for both families that does not imply minimum distance reduction arising from extraction circuit faults that propagate from the check qubits to the data qubits. Finally, we numerically evaluate their logical error rates under a code capacity depolarizing noise model using the belief propagation ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and minimum-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoders, yielding thresholds of approximately $14-16\%$ for the odd and even families, very similar to those of rotated surface codes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Fourier analysis is an important topic in mathematical physics. We introduce a systematic protocol for testing and measuring ``magic'' in quantum states and gates, using a quantum Fourier approach. Magic, as a quantum resource, is necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in computation. Our protocols are based on quantum convolutions and swap tests, implemented via quantum circuits. We describe this for both qubit and qudit systems. Our quantum Fourier approach offers a unified method to quantify magic, in stabilizer circuits, as well as in matchgate and bosonic Gaussian circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the fidelity of single-qubit gates requires a combination of faster pulses and increased qubit coherence. However, with resonant qubit drive via a capacitively coupled port, these two objectives are mutually contradictory, as higher qubit quality factor requires a weaker coupling, necessitating longer pulses for the same applied power. Increasing drive power, on the other hand, can heat the qubit's environment and degrade coherence. In this work, by using the inherent nonlinearity of the transmon qubit, we circumvent this issue by introducing a new parametric driving scheme to perform single-qubit control. We achieve rapid gate speed by pumping the transmon's native Kerr term at approximately one third of the qubit's resonant frequency. Given that transmons typically operate within a fairly narrow range of anharmonicity, this technique is applicable to all transmons. In both theory and experiment, we show that the Rabi rate of the process is proportional to applied drive amplitude cubed, allowing for rapid gate speed with only modest increases in applied power. In addition, we demonstrate that filtering can be used to protect the qubit's coherence while performing rapid gates, and present theoretical calculations indicating that decay due to multi-photon losses, even in very strongly coupled drive lines, will not limit qubit lifetime. We demonstrate single qubit gates as short as 37.4ns with fidelity as high as 99.91%. We also present calculations indicating that this technique could reduce cryostat heating for fast gates, a vital requirement for large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</description>

Abstract: Sensitivity in metrology without entanglement is limited by standard quantum limit (SQL). Recent studies have found that the Heisenberg-limited scaling -- ultimate sensitivity in quantum metrology -- can be achieved by generalized cat states, characterized by an index that indicates coherence among macroscopically distinct states. Although generalized cat states include diverse states, encompassing classical mixtures of exponentially large numbers of states, the preparation of large generalized cat states has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we characterize SQL-beating cat-like states using the index $q$ indicating macroscopic coherence and prove that any state with $q&gt;1.5$ has a potential to surpass the SQL when used as a sensor. We then propose a protocol to generate them through repetitive measurements on a quantum spin system of $N$ spins, which we call a spin ensemble. Starting from a thermal equilibrium state of the spin ensemble, we demonstrate that we can increase the coherence among the spin ensemble via repetitive weak measurements of its total magnetization, which is indirectly measured through an ancillary qubit collectively coupled to the ensemble. Notably, our method for creating the SQL-beating cat-like states requires no dynamical control over the spin ensemble. As a potential experimental realization, we discuss a hybrid system composed of a superconducting flux qubit and donor spins in silicon. Our results pave the way for the realization of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology in state-of-the-art technology.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) quantum XYZ product can construct a class of non-CSS quantum codes by using three classical codes. However, there has been limited study on their error-correcting performance so far and whether this code construction can be generalized to higher dimension is an open question. In this paper, we first study the error-correcting performance of the 3D Chamon code, which is an instance of the 3D XYZ product of three repetition codes. Second, we show that the 3D XYZ product can be generalized to four dimension and propose four-dimensional (4D) XYZ product code construction, which constructs a class of non-CSS quantum codes by using either four classical codes or two CSS quantum codes. Compared with the 4D homological product, we show that the 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with higher code dimension or code distance. Third, we consider two instances of the 4D XYZ product, to which we refer as the 4D Chamon code and the 4D XYZ product concatenated code, respectively. Our simulation results show that, the 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with better error-correcting performance against Pauli-$Z$-biased noise than CSS codes constructed by the 4D homological product. Finally, we present the geometric arrangement of the 4D Chamon code within a 4D cubic lattice, demonstrating that it possesses two key characteristics of fracton models, which strongly suggest that it is a novel 4D fracton model.</description>

Abstract: We present a classical algorithm based on Pauli propagation for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on random unstructured quantum circuits across all circuit architectures and depths, including those with all-to-all connectivity. We prove that for any architecture where each circuit layer is randomly sampled from a distribution invariant under single-qubit rotations, our algorithm achieves a small error $\varepsilon$ on all circuits except for a small fraction $\delta$. The computational time is polynomial in qubit count and circuit depth for any small constant $\varepsilon, \delta$, and quasi-polynomial for inverse-polynomially small $\varepsilon, \delta$. Our results show that estimating observables of quantum circuits exhibiting chaotic and locally scrambling behavior is classically tractable across all geometries. We further conduct numerical experiments beyond our average-case assumptions, demonstrating the potential utility of Pauli propagation methods for simulating real-time dynamics and finding low-energy states of physical Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a methodology for constructing polynomial transformations of a linear operator encoded in a unitary. Applied to an encoding of a state $\rho$, QSP enables the evaluation of nonlinear functions of the form $\text{tr}(P(\rho))$ for a polynomial $P(x)$, which encompasses relevant properties like entropies and fidelity. However, QSP is a sequential algorithm: implementing a degree-$d$ polynomial necessitates $d$ queries to the encoding, equating to a query depth $d$. Here, we reduce the depth of these property estimation algorithms by developing Parallel Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm parallelizes the computation of $\text{tr} (P(\rho))$ over $k$ systems and reduces the query depth to $d/k$, thus enabling a family of time-space tradeoffs for QSP. This furnishes a property estimation algorithm suitable for distributed quantum computers, and is realized at the expense of increasing the number of measurements by a factor $O( \text{poly}(d) 2^{O(k)} )$. We achieve this result by factorizing $P(x)$ into a product of $k$ smaller polynomials of degree $O(d/k)$, which are each implemented in parallel with QSP, and subsequently multiplied together with a swap test to reconstruct $P(x)$. We characterize the achievable class of polynomials by appealing to the fundamental theorem of algebra, and demonstrate application to canonical problems including entropy estimation and partition function evaluation.</description>

Abstract: The theory of quantum states over time extends the density operator formalism into the temporal domain, providing a unified of treatment of timelike and spacelike separated systems in quantum theory. Although recent results have characterized quantum states over time involving two timelike separated systems, it remains unclear how to consistently extend the notion of quantum states over time to multipartite temporal scenarios, such as those considered in studies of Leggett-Garg inequalities. In this Letter, we show that two simple assumptions uniquely single out the Markovian multipartite extension of bipartite quantum states over time, namely, linearity in the initial state and a quantum analog of conditionability for multipartite probability distributions. As a direct consequence of our result, we establish a canonical correspondence between multipartite QSOTs and Kirkwood-Dirac type quasiprobability distributions, which we show opens up the possibility of experimentally verifying the temporal correlations encoded in QSOTs via the recent experimental technique of simulating quasiprobability known as quantum snapshotting.</description>

      <title>Efficient explicit circuit for quantum state preparation of piece-wise continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently uploading data into quantum states is essential for many quantum algorithms to achieve advantage across various applications. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a method to upload a polynomial function $f(x)$ on the interval $x \in [-1,1]$ into a pure quantum state consisting of qubits, where a discretized $f(x)$ is the amplitude of this state. The preparation cost has $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ scaling in the number of qubits $n$ and linear scaling with the degree of the polynomial $Q$. This efficiency allows the preparation of states whose amplitudes correspond to high-degree polynomials, enabling the approximation of almost any continuous function. We introduce an explicit algorithm for uploading such functions using four real polynomials that meet specific parity and boundedness conditions. We also generalize this approach to piece-wise polynomial functions, with the algorithm scaling linearly with the number of piecewise parts. Our method achieves efficient quantum circuit implementation and we present detailed gate counting and resource analysis.</description>

      <title>Sub-Poissonian Light in a Waveguide Kerr-medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. Modern $\text{Si}_3\text{N}_4$ chip waveguides are attractive due to their high Kerr nonlinearity, suppressed Brillouin scattering on guided acoustic waves (GAWBS), and lengths up to one meter. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer new analytical formulas for estimating the capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</description>

      <title>Riemannian quantum circuit optimization based on matrix product operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Weak convexity of Fisher information matrix and superresolved localization of blinking sources of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</description>

Abstract: A new type of link between geometry of symplectic group and entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) is presented. Relations of symplectic subspaces and quaternary additive codes concerning parameters of EAQECCs are described. Thus, parameters of EA stabilizer codes are revealed in the nomenclature of additive codes. Our techniques enable us solve some open problems about optimal EAQECCs and entanglement-assisted quantum minimum distance separable (EAQMDS) codes, and are also useful for designing encoding and decoding quantum circuit of EA stabilizer codes.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Test and characterization of multilayer ion traps on fused silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion traps are a promising architecture to host a future quantum computer. Several challenges, such as signal-routing, power dissipation, and fabrication quality need to be overcome to scale ion trap devices to hundreds of ions. Currently, ion traps are often fabricated on silicon substrates which result in high power dissipation. Substrates that lead to lower power dissipation are preferred. In this work, we present a multi-metal layer ion trap on a fused silica substrate that is fabricated and tested in an industrial facility. Its design and material-stack are tailored to minimize power dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the integrated temperature sensors and verify functionality down to 10 K. Moreover, we demonstrate an automated wafer test to validate each trap chip prior to its integration into experimental setups. Subsequently, we characterize electric field noise and electric stray fields using a single trapped-ion as a probe, showing an improvement in trap performance over similar trap designs realized on silicon substrates.</description>

      <title>Classification of three-qubit genuine entangled states using concurrence fill</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the successful experimental generation and verification of genuine multipartite entanglement, several existing entanglement measures remain insufficient to reliably capture its presence. In this study, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement of pure states using the area associated with the underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next, we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states for which three-tangle is known to vanish over a zero polytope. Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the corresponding mixture and obtain its upper bound for mixed states with zero tangle.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Depth Decomposition of Approximate Multi-Controlled Single-Qubit Gates Without Ancilla Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates are essential components in this process. In this work, we present an improved decomposition of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a single ancilla qubit while reducing the ancillary resource requirements compared to previous work. We further introduce a relative-phase multi-controlled NOT gate that eliminates the need for ancillas. Building on these results, we optimize a previously proposed decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary U(2) gates, which do not require ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this project is freely available.</description>

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers remains a substantial scientific and technological challenge. Leveraging the full range of intrinsic degrees of freedom in quantum systems offers a promising route towards enhanced algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. We experimentally study the use of $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions for quantum information processing, achieving high-fidelity state preparation and readout of up to 25 internal levels, thus forming a 25-dimensional qudit. By probing superpositions of up to 24 states, we investigate how errors scale with qudit dimension $d$ and identify the primary error sources affecting quantum coherence. Additionally, we demonstrate high-dimensional qudit operations by implementing a 3-qubit Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and a 4-qubit Toffoli gate with a single ion. Our findings suggest that quantum computing architectures based on large-dimensional qudits hold significant promise.</description>

      <title>Approximate k-uniform states: definition, construction and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $k$-Uniform states are fundamental to quantum information and computing, with applications in multipartite entanglement and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Prior work has primarily focused on constructing exact $k$-uniform states or proving their nonexistence. However, due to inevitable theoretical approximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform states is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate the study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are locally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive measurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with high probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via shallow random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we establish a connection between approximate $k$-uniform states and approximate QECCs, showing that Haar random constructions yield high-performance codes with linear rates, vanishing proximity, and exponentially small failure probability while random circuits can't construct codes with linear code rate in shallow depth. Finally, we investigate the relationship between approximate QECCs and approximate quantum information masking. Our work lays the foundation for the practical application of $k$-uniform states.</description>

      <title>Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization. Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state has spectral weight on the so-called quantum many-body scar states, which are non-thermalizing eigenstates embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal eigenstates. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems, particular to systems which exhibit scars-induced entanglement oscillations. We exemplify this with the PXP model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between temporally-separated transient states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. The retention of memory and revivals between transient subsystem states is a finer form of memory effect than captured by the revivals of full system's fidelity with the initial states. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Expanding a 4-qubit Dicke State to a 5-qubit Dicke State with Limited Qubit Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scenarios where full access to all qubits of a multipartite quantum system is available and global operations can be implemented, the preparation of arbitrary entangled states is theoretically straightforward. However, practical constraints often limit direct control over all qubits. In this work, we first present an efficient method for preparing a four-qubit Dicke state, and then demonstrate how a four-qubit Dicke state can be expanded to a five-qubit Dicke state even when only a subset of qubits is accessible. We propose a quantum circuit that achieves this transformation under restricted control, and support our analytical derivation with numerical simulations. We further carry out a robustness analysis of our circuit under imperfect gate implementations and find that it retains high fidelity for experimentally relevant levels of coherent over-rotation errors, confirming its resilience to realistic noise.</description>

Abstract: In this short-length paper, we will present some math that play a central role in quantum hydrodynamics and that were presented by Mita in the past. In this formulation of QM, a quantity is involved which is called the diffusion flux. As we will see, this quantity plays a crucial role on the evolution of wave packets. More specifically, we will initially briefly explain some results derived in Mita's papers, by analyzing Gaussian and soliton wave packets, while our main focus is on the role of diffusion in the evolution of super-luminal wave packets. Also, A very brief discussion will be made about the presence of the osmotic velocity field in quantum dynamics</description>

      <title>A unified realization of electrical quantities from the quantum International System of Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</description>

      <title>Exact perturbative expansion of the transport coefficients of a normal low-temperature Fermi gas with contact interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group.</description>

      <title>Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <title>Effects of finite trapping on the decay, recoil, and decoherence of dark states of quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective interaction of electronic excitations with the electromagnetic field in atomic arrays can lead to reduced decay rates, forming subradiant states with applications in quantum information and memories. By including quantized vibrational excitations, we examine the effects of finite trap strength and light-mediated forces on highly subradiant singly-excited states for two, three, and many atoms in a 1D waveguide or free space. For waveguide-coupled and tightly trapped atoms, the recoil energy from photon emission can reach a vibrational quantum, even in the Lamb-Dicke regime. For weakly trapped atoms, the vibrational wavepackets are shifted or distorted due to induced forces and uneven decay. These effects lead to a time-dependent decay rate, extra vibrational energy transfer, and mixing of different electronic and vibrational states. The resulting entanglement entropy and infidelity can be mitigated by decreasing the induced forces or increasing trap strength. For quantum information storage, these findings suggest optimal array configurations in geometry and polarization. Our results provide insights for quantum memories and atom array experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm to generate maximally orthogonal frames in complex space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A frame is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to a redundant overspanning set whose vectors are linearly dependent. Frames find applications in signal processing and quantum information theory. We present a genetic algorithm that can generate maximally orthogonal frames of arbitrary size $n$ in $d$-dimensional complex space. First, we formalize the concept of maximally orthogonal frame and demonstrate that it depends on the choice of an energy function to weigh the different pairwise overlaps between vectors. Then, we discuss the relation between different energy functions and well-known frame varieties such as tight and Grassmannian frames and complex projective $p$-designs. Obtaining maximally orthogonal frames poses a global non-convex minimization problem. We discuss the relation with established numerical problems such as the Thomson problem and the problem of finding optimal packings in complex projective space. To tackle the minimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm that features local optimization of the parents. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we propose two visualization techniques that allow us to analyze the coherence and uniformity of high-dimensional frames. The genetic algorithm is able to produce highly-symmetric universal frames, such as equiangular tight frames, symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measurements (SIC-POVMs) and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for configurations of up to $d=6$ and $n=36$, with runtimes of the order of several minutes on a regular desktop computer for the largest configurations.</description>

      <title>Universal theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch band theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian bands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher dimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on the system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a universal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains its origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for the first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ framework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is the superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of validity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological effects and non-Hermitian Chern bands.</description>

      <title>The Bose-Hubbard polaron from weak to strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.</description>
