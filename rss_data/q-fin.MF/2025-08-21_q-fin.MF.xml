      <title>Call Option Price using Pearson Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the foundational work of the Black--Scholes model, extensive research has been developed to price the option by addressing its underlying assumptions and associated pricing biases. This study introduces a novel framework for pricing European call options by modeling the underlying asset's return dynamics using Pearson diffusion processes, characterized by a linear drift and a quadratic squared diffusion coefficient. This class of diffusion processes offers a key advantage in its ability to capture the skewness and excess kurtosis of the return distribution, well-documented empirical features of financial returns. We also establish the validity of the risk-neutral measure by verifying the Novikov condition, thereby ensuring that the model does not admit arbitrage opportunities. Further, we study the existence of a unique strong solution of stock prices under the risk-neutral measure. We apply the proposed method to Nifty 50 index option data and conduct a comparative analysis against the classical Black--Scholes and Heston stochastic volatility models. Results indicate that our method shows superior performance compared to the other two benchmark models. These results carry practical implications for market participants, including market makers, hedge funds, and derivative traders.</description>

      <title>Pricing Options on Forwards in Function-Valued Affine Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pricing of European-style options written on forward contracts within function-valued infinite-dimensional affine stochastic volatility models. The dynamics of the underlying forward price curves are modeled within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton-Musiela framework as solution to a stochastic partial differential equation modulated by a stochastic volatility process. We analyze two classes of affine stochastic volatility models: (i) a Gaussian model governed by a finite-rank Wishart process, and (ii) a pure-jump affine model extending the Barndorff--Nielsen--Shephard framework with state-dependent jumps in the covariance component. For both models, we derive conditions for the existence of exponential moments and develop semi-closed Fourier-based pricing formulas for vanilla call and put options written on forward price curves. Our approach allows for tractable pricing in models with infinitely many risk factors, thereby capturing maturity-specific and term structure risk essential in forward markets.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem with both relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint, leading to a stochastic control problem with dynamic state-control constraints. In our relaxed tracking formulation, it is assumed that the fund manager can strategically inject capital to the fund account such that the total capital process always outperforms the benchmark process, which is described by a geometric Brownian motion. We first transform the original regular-singular control problem with state-control constraints into an equivalent regular control problem with a reflected state process and consumption drawdown constraint. By utilizing the dual transform and the optimal consumption behavior, we then turn to study the linear dual PDE with both Neumann boundary condition and free boundary condition in a piecewise manner across different regions. Using the smoothfit principle and the super-contact condition, we derive the closed-form solution of the dual PDE, and obtain the optimal investment and consumption in feedback form. We then prove the verification theorem on optimality by some novel arguments with the aid of an auxiliary reflected dual process and some technical estimations. Some numerical examples and financial insights are also presented.</description>

      <title>Particle Systems with Local Interactions via Hitting Times and Cascades on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study particle systems interacting via hitting times on sparsely connected graphs, following the framework of Lacker, Ramanan and Wu (2023). We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.</description>
