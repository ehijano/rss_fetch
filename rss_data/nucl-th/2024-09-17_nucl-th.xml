      <title>Nuclear masses and fission barriers within the isospin-square liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New liquid drop model with the isospin-square dependence of the volume and surface energy terms is applied to reproduce experimentally known masses of nuclei with number of protons and neutrons larger or equal to twenty. The ground-state microscopic energy corrections are taken into account. In spite of the fact that the model contains only six adjustable parameters, the quality of mass reproduction is good, and it is comparable with other contemporary mass models. Also, the fission barrier heights of actinide nuclei evaluated using the topographical theorem of Myers and Swiatecki are close to the data.</description>

      <title>Higher forbidden unique $\beta^-$ decay transitions and shell-model interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have predicted the half-lives for the $\beta^{-}$ decay for higher forbidden unique transitions in the mass range of nuclei from A = 40-138. For these transitions, the experimental data for half-lives are not available except for a few cases. The calculations for half-lives are performed within the framework of the nuclear shell model (SM). We have used the effective interactions sdpf-mu, gxpf1a, gwbxg, G-matrix, snet, sn100pn, and jj56pnb to perform the SM calculations in different mass regions. A comprehensive discussion has been made between the SM-predicted half-lives and the scaled half-lives from proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA). The results of the present study will be useful to plan new experiments to measure half-lives for these higher forbidden unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy flavor azimuthal correlations and spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological impact of the pre-equilibrium glasma initial stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quark azimuthal correlations and spectra. Using our numerical solver, we simulate the transport of heavy quark test particles in an SU(3) glasma background field. The glasma field equations are formulated using classical real-time lattice gauge theory, and the heavy quark dynamics are described by classical transport equations numerically solved using the colored particle-in-cell method. For the first time, the effect of the glasma stage on the azimuthal correlations of $c\overline{c}$ and $b\overline{b}$ pairs is studied. The resulting azimuthal width $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ exhibits a large and quick decorrelation due to the strong glasma fields. Further, we evaluate how the $p_T$-broadening in the glasma affects heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, which are initialized according to the FONLL heavy quark production calculation. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is extracted for $c$ and $b$ quarks in the glasma and additional nuclear PDF effects accounting for gluon shadowing are included.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavor angular correlations as a direct probe of the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use classical equations of motion for heavy quarks to show that the pre-equilibrium glasma phase of a heavy ion collision has an extremely strong effect on heavy quark angular correlations. At the same time, the effect on the single inclusive spectrum is much more moderate. This suggests that $D\overline{D}$ meson angular correlations in future LHC measurements could provide direct experimental access to the physics of the pre-equilibrium stage.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-level effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion: Inelastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mu2e and COMET will search for electrons produced via the neutrinoless conversion of stopped muons bound in 1s atomic orbits of $^{27}$Al, improving existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. Conventionally, $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are optimized to detect electrons originating from transitions where the nucleus remains in the ground state, thereby maximizing the energy of the outgoing electron. Clearly, detection of a positive signal in forthcoming experiments would stimulate additional work $-$ including subsequent conversion experiments using complementary nuclear targets $-$ to further constrain the new physics responsible for CLFV. Here we argue that additional information can be extracted without the need for additional experiments, by considering inelastic conversion in $^{27}$Al. Transitions to low-lying nuclear excited states can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, with the ratio of the elastic and inelastic responses being sensitive to the underlying CLFV operator. We extend the nuclear effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion to the inelastic case, which adds five new response functions to the six that arise for the elastic process. We evaluate these nuclear response functions in $^{27}$Al and calculate the resulting conversion-electron signal, taking into account the resolution anticipated in Mu2e/COMET. We find that $^{27}$Al is an excellent target choice from the perspective of the new information that can be obtained from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of gluon plasma: A q-potential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma using Kramer's $q-potential$ method. We propose a modification in the first law of thermodynamics by including a temperature-dependent term when single particle energies themselves are temperature-dependent. With this modified first law, we derive an expression for pressure starting from Kramer's $q-potential$. We find that to maintain thermodynamic consistency, pressure receives an additional term solely due to medium-dependent dispersion relation. The energy density, by definition, remains a sum over all the single-particle energies with an appropriate weight factor. We confront this quasiparticle model with the lattice QCD data of SU(3) pure gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel relaxation time approximation for kinetic theory with spin which takes into account the nonlocality of particle collisions. In particular, it models the property of the microscopic nonlocal collision term to vanish in global, but not in local equilibrium. We study the asymptotic distribution function obtained as the solution of the Boltzmann equation within the nonlocal relaxation time approximation in the limit of small gradients and short relaxation time. We show that the resulting polarization agrees with the one obtained from the Zubarev formalism for a certain value of a coefficient that determines the time scale on which orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. This coefficient can be identified with a parameter related to the pseudo gauge choice in the Zubarev formalism. Finally, we demonstrate how the nonlocal collision term generates polarization from vorticity by studying a nonrelativistic rotating cylinder both from kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches, which are shown to be equivalent in this example.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

Abstract: We have shown that the relationship between the DIS structure functions is stable for a nuclear target with mass number A at $x{\leq}10^{-3}$. Numerical results are provided for the specific nuclei 12C and 208Pb using the nuclear PDF parameterizations implemented in the HIJING2.0 model. These results fall whithin the EIC kinematic acceptance for heavy ion running. The ratio $R^{A}_{F_{L}}$ is calculated as the ratio $R^{A}_{F_{2}}$ in the HIJING2.0 model.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low $Q_\beta$ value for the allowed decay of $^{110}$Ag$^m$ confirmed via mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of $^{109}$Ag isotope was measured with respect to $^{110}$Cd with the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique using the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap at the IGISOL facility. By combining this new result with the known spectroscopic information, the $Q_\beta$ value of $405(135)$ eV between the $6^+$ isomer of $^{110}$Ag and the $5^+_2$ state in $^{110}$Cd was determined. This is the lowest $Q_\beta$ for any allowed transition observed to date. The nuclear shell-model results were performed with the {\sc kshell} code employing the \textit{jj45pnb} interaction, and combined with the state-of-the-art atomic calculations. The theoretical partial half-life, $2.23^{+5.24}_{-1.28} \times 10^7$ years, and the resulting branching ratio, $3.07^{+4.16}_{-2.15} \times 10^{-8}$, combined with a viable production method, thermal-neutron capture on stable $^{109}$Ag, make $^{110}$Ag$^{m}$ as a promising candidate for future antineutrino mass measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study of $^{28}$Si: coexistence of oblate, prolate and superdeformed shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the shape coexistence in the nucleus $^{28}$Si with the nuclear shell model using numerical diagonalizations complemented with variational calculations based on the projected generator-coordinate method. The theoretical electric quadrupole moments and transitions as well as the collective wavefunctions indicate that the standard USDB interaction in the $sd$ shell describes well the ground-state oblate rotational band, but misses the experimental prolate band. Guided by the quasi-SU(3) model, we show that the prolate band can be reproduced in the $sd$ shell by reducing the energy of the $0d_{3/2}$ orbital. Alternatively, in the extended $sdpf$ configuration space a modification of the SDPF-NR interaction that accommodates cross-shell excitations also reproduces the oblate and prolate bands. Finally, we address the possibility of superdeformation in $^{28}$Si within the $sdpf$ space. Our results indicate that superdeformed structures appear at about $18$-$20$~MeV.</description>

      <title>Determination of pairing matrix elements from average single particle level densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple and efficient method to treat nuclear pairing correlations within a simple Hartree-Fock--plus-BCS description is proposed and discussed. It relies on the fact that the intensity of pairing correlations depends crucially on level densities around the Fermi surface ($ \rho(e_F)$) and that any fitting of nuclear energies as functions of the nucleon numbers is akin of a semi-classical average, smoothing out their quantal structure. A particular attention has been paid to two points generally ignored in previous similar approaches. One is a correction advocated by M\"{o}ller and Nix [Nucl. Phys. A 536, 20 (1992)] taking into account the fact that the data included into the fit correspond to $ \rho(e_F)$ values systematically lower than average. The second is due to a systematic overestimation of the proton sp level density at the Fermi surface resulting from the local Slater approximation of the Coulomb terms in use in most microscopic descriptions. Our approach is validated by the agreement with data of corresponding calculated moments of inertia of well and rigidly deformed rare-earth nuclei, evaluated according to the Inglis-Belyaev ansatz with some crude Thouless-Valatin corrections. Indeed, the agreement which is found, is at least of the same quality as what results from a specific fit of the pairing intensities to these particular pieces of data. While this approach is currently limited to the very simple seniority force pairing treatment, it may serve as a starting point to define pairing residual interactions from averaged odd-even mass differences data, using merely average sp level densities associated to calculated canonical basis.</description>

      <title>Odd-even mass differences of well and rigidly deformed nuclei in the rare earth region: A test of a newly proposed fit of average pairing matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a test of a recently proposed approach to determine average pairing matrix elements within a given interval of single-particle states (sp) around the Fermi level $\lambda$ as obtained in the so-called uniform gap method (UGM). It takes stock of the crucial role played by the averaged sp level density $\tilde{\rho}(e)$. These matrix elements are deduced within the UGM approach, from microscopically calculated $\tilde{\rho}(e)$ and gaps obtained from analytical formulae of a semi-classical nature. Two effects generally ignored in similar fits have been taken care of. They are: (a) the correction for a systematic bias in choosing to fit pairing gaps corresponding to equilibrium deformation solutions as discussed by M\"{o}ller and Nix [Nucl. Phys. A 476, 1 (1992)] and (b) the correction for a systematic spurious enhancement of $\tilde{\rho}(e)$ for protons in the vicinity of $\lambda$, because of the local Slater approximation used for the treatment of the Coulomb exchange terms in most calculations (see e.g. [Phys. Rev C 84, 014310 (2011)]). This approach has been deemed to be very efficient upon performing Hartree-Fock + BCS (with seniority force and self-consistent blocking when dealing with odd nuclei) calculations of a large sample of well and rigidly deformed even-even rare-earth nuclei. The reproduction of their experimental moments of inertia has been found to be at least of the same quality as what has been obtained in a direct fit of these data [Phys. Rev C 99, 064306 (2019)]. We extend here the test of our approach to the reproduction, in the same region, of three-point odd-even mass differences centered on odd-$N$ or odd-$Z$ nuclei. The agreement with the data is again roughly of the same quality as what has been obtained in a direct fit, as performed in [Phys. Rev C 99, 064306 (2019)].</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a rotating hadron resonance gas with van der Waals interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the thermodynamics of the systems produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is crucial in understanding the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new avenue has opened regarding the implications of large initial angular momentum and subsequent vorticity in the medium evolution in high-energy collisions. This adds a new type of chemical potential into the partonic and hadronic systems, called the rotational chemical potential. We study the thermodynamics of an interacting hadronic matter under rotation, formed in an ultra-relativistic collision. We introduce attractive and repulsive interactions through the van der Waals equation of state. Thermodynamic properties like the pressure ($P$), energy density ($\varepsilon$), entropy density ($s$), trace anomaly ($(\varepsilon - 3P)/T^{4}$), specific heat ($c_{\rm v}$) and squared speed of sound ($c_{\rm s}^{2}$) are studied as functions of temperature ($T$) for zero and finite rotation chemical potential. The conserved charge fluctuations, which can be quantified by their respective susceptibilities, are also studied. The rotational (spin) density corresponding to the rotational chemical potential is explored. In addition, we explore the possible liquid-gas phase transition in the hadron gas with van der Waals interaction in the $T$ -- $\omega$ phase space.</description>

      <title>Impact of Medium Anisotropy on Quarkonium Dissociation and Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultra-relativistic collisions plays a crucial role in probing the existence of hot QCD matter. This study explores quarkonia states dissociation and regeneration in the hot QCD medium while considering momentum anisotropy. The net quarkonia decay width ($\Gamma_{D}$) arises from two essential processes: collisional damping and gluonic dissociation. The quarkonia regeneration includes the transition from octet to singlet states within the anisotropic medium. Our study utilizes a medium-modified potential that incorporates anisotropy via particle distribution functions. This modified potential gives rise to collisional damping for quarkonia due to the surrounding medium, as well as the transition of quarkonia from singlet to octet states due to interactions with gluons. Furthermore, we employ the detailed balance approach to investigate the regeneration of quarkonia within this medium. Our comprehensive analysis spans various temperature settings, transverse momentum values, and anisotropic strengths. Notably, we find that, in addition to medium temperatures and heavy quark transverse momentum, anisotropy significantly influences the dissociation and regeneration of various quarkonia states.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions are reported by the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200~\rm{GeV}$. We report several first measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, which are i) $J/\psi$ photoproduction with large momentum transfer up to $2.2~\rm{(GeV/c)^{2}}$, ii) coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction associated with neutron emissions from nuclear breakup, iii) the rapidity dependence of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction, iv) the $\psi(2s)$ photoproduction cross section at mid-rapidity, and v) $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair photoproduction up to high invariant mass of 6 $\rm{GeV/c^2}$. For measurement ii), the coherent $J/\psi$ total cross section of $\gamma^{\ast} + \rm{Au} \rightarrow J/\psi + \rm{Au}$ as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W_{\rm{\gamma* N}}$ has been obtained without photon energy ambiguities. The data are quantitatively compared with the Monte Carlo models STARlight, Sartre, BeAGLE, and theoretical calculations of gluon saturation with color glass condensate, nuclear shadowing with leading twist approximation, Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD. At the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. These data provide an important experimental constraint for nuclear parton distribution functions and a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of the nuclear modification effect at the top RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV and Au+Au collisions at 0.2 TeV, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle.' These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire \(p_T\) and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities (\(\varepsilon_{n}\)), dimensionless size (\(\mathbb{R}\)), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function (\(\delta_f\)), the medium's stopping power (\(\Hat{q}\)), and specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>Coherent photo- and electroproduction of charmonia on nuclear targets revisited: Green function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>
