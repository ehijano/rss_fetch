      <title>Trading with market resistance and concave price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal trading problem under a market impact model with endogenous market resistance generated by a sophisticated trader who (partially) detects metaorders and trades against them to exploit price overreactions induced by the order flow. The model features a concave transient impact driven by a power-law propagator with a resistance term responding to the trader's rate via a fixed-point equation involving a general resistance function. We derive a (non)linear stochastic Fredholm equation as the first-order optimality condition satisfied by optimal trading strategies. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal control are established when the resistance function is linear, and an existence result is obtained when it is strictly convex using coercivity and weak lower semicontinuity of the associated profit-and-loss functional. We also propose an iterative scheme to solve the nonlinear stochastic Fredholm equation and prove an exponential convergence rate. Numerical experiments confirm this behavior and illustrate optimal round-trip strategies under "buy" signals with various decay profiles and different market resistance specifications.</description>

      <title>Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) for High-Frequency Limit Order Book Forecasting: Efficiency, Interpretability, and Alpha Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Frequency trading (HFT) environments are characterised by large volumes of limit order book (LOB) data, which is notoriously noisy and non-linear. Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS). The code for the experiments in this project can be found at https://github.com/AhmadMak/Temporal-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-T-KAN-for-High-Frequency-Limit-Order-Book-Forecasting.</description>
