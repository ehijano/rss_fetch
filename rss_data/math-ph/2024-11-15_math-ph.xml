      <title>Mathematical theory on multi-layer high contrast acoustic subwavelength resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonance is a vital acoustic phenomenon in contrasting media. The narrow bandgap width of single-layer resonator has prompted the exploration of multi-layer metamaterials as an effective alternative, which consist of alternating nests of high-contrast materials, called ``resonators'', and a background media. In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for studying acoustics within multi-layer high-contrast structures. Firstly, by using layer potential techniques, we establish the representation formula in terms of a matrix type operator with a block tridiagonal form for multi-layer structures within general geometry. Then we prove the existence of subwavelength resonances via Gohberg-Sigal theory, which generalizes the celebrated Minnaert resonances in single-layer structures. Intriguingly, we find that the primary contribution to mode splitting lies in the fact that as the number of nested resonators increases, the degree of the corresponding characteristic polynomial also increases, while the type of resonance (consists solely of monopolar resonances) remains unchanged. Furthermore, we derive original formulas for the subwavelength resonance frequencies of concentric dual-resonator. Numerical results associated with different nested resonators are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Circulant graphs as an example of discrete quantum unique ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete analog of quantum unique ergodicity was proved for Cayley graphs of quasirandom groups by Magee, Thomas and Zhao. They show that for large graphs there exist real orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of the adjacency matrix such that quantum probability measures of the eigenfunctions put approximately the correct proportion of their mass on subsets of the vertices that are not too small. We investigate this property for Cayley graphs of cyclic groups (circulant graphs). We observe that there exist sequences of orthonormal eigenfunction bases which are perfectly equidistributed. However, for sequences of 4-regular circulant graphs of prime order, we show that there are no sequences of real orthonormal bases where all sequences of eigenfunctions equidistribute. To obtain this result, we also prove that, for large 4-regular circulant graphs of prime order, the maximum multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is two.</description>

      <title>Simons Lectures on Categorical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Categorical Symmetries are a powerful new tool for analyzing quantum field theories. This volume compiles lecture notes from the 2022 and 2023 summer schools on Global Categorical Symmetries, held at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and at the Swiss Map Research Station in Les Diableret. Specifically, this volume collects the lectures:
  * An introduction to symmetries in quantum field theory, Kantaro Ohmori
  * Introduction to anomalies in quantum field theory, Clay C\'ordova
  * Symmetry Categories 101, Michele Del Zotto
  * Applied Cobordism Hypothesis, David Jordan
  * Finite symmetry in QFT, Daniel S. Freed
  These volumes are devoted to interested newcomers: we only assume (basic) knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and some relevant maths. We try to give appropriate references for non-standard materials that are not covered. Our aim in this first volume is to illustrate some of the main questions and ideas together with some of the methods and the techniques necessary to begin exploring global categorical symmetries of QFTs.</description>

      <title>Euler's original derivation of elastica equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elucidate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dirac structures and discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of $(\pm)$-discrete Dirac structures over a manifold, where we define $(\pm)$-discrete two-forms on the manifold and incorporate discrete constraints using $(\pm)$-finite difference maps. Specifically, we develop $(\pm)$-discrete induced Dirac structures as discrete analogues of the induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle over a configuration manifold, as described by Yoshimura and Marsden (2006). We demonstrate that $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems can be naturally formulated in conjunction with the $(\pm)$-induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle. Furthermore, we show that the resulting equations of motion are equivalent to the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert equations proposed in Cort\'es and Mart\'inez (2001) and McLachlan and Perlmutter (2006). We also clarify the variational structures of the discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems within the framework of the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert--Pontryagin principle. Finally, we validate the proposed discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems with some illustrative examples of nonholonomic systems through numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy in QFT from modular theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalization of the Araki-Uhlmann formula for relative entropy to Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy. We compute this entropy for a free scalar field in the Minkowski wedge between the vacuum and a coherent state, as well as for a thermal state. In contrast to the relative entropy which in these cases only depends on the sympletic form and thus reduces to the classical entropy of a wave packet, the Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy also depends on the symmetric part of the two-point function and is thus genuinely quantum.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a one-dimensional fractional diffusion equation with variable coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse problem of finding a time-dependent multiplier of the right-hand side of a time-fractional one-dimensional diffusion equation with variables coefficients in the case where the usual Cauchy, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary, and an integral overdetermination conditions are given. The overdetermination condition has the form of an integral with a weight over a spatial segment from the solution of the direct problem, in which the weight function is a spatially dependent known factor of the right-hand side of the equation. This made it possible to construct a solution to the inverse problem in explicit form and prove its correctness in the class of regular solutions</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees. We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve questions related to the mixing of Glauber dynamics in the ferromagnetic Potts model from a uniform monochromatic coloring, and sampling using data-based initializations.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and Uniqueness of Duality Cascades in Three Dimensions for Affine Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three-dimensional circular-quiver supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories, the questions, whether duality cascades always terminate and whether the endpoint is unique, were rephrased into the question whether a polytope defined in the parameter space of relative ranks for duality cascades is a parallelotope, filling the space by discrete translations. By regarding circular quivers as affine Dynkin diagrams, we generalize the arguments into other affine quivers. We find that, after rewriting properties into the group-theoretical language, most arguments work in the generalizations. Especially, we find that, instead of the original relation to parallelotopes, the corresponding polytope still fills the parameter space but with some gaps. This indicates that, under certain restrictions, duality cascades still terminate uniquely.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most theoretical and numerical results regarding water waves rely on the irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify significantly the mathematical formulation. This assumption is rarely discussed in details. In this work we investigate the well-foundedness of this important hypothesis using numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equation, using a scheme introduced in Riquier and Dormy (2024). We show that, in the presence of an irregular bottom, a gravity wave of non-negligible height can effectively destabilise the bottom boundary layer, stripping off vortices into the main flow. As a vortex approaches the surface the solution of the Navier-Stokes flow in the limit of vanishing viscosity is shown to differ from the inviscid Euler solution.</description>

      <title>A Method to Extrapolate the Data for the Inverse Magnetisation Problem with a Planar Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particular instance of the inverse magnetisation problem is considered. It is assumed that the support of a magnetic sample (a source term in the Poisson equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$) is contained in a bounded planar set parallel to the measurement plane. Moreover, only one component of the magnetic field is assumed to be known (measured) over the same planar region in the measurement plane. We propose a method to extrapolate the measurement data to the whole plane relying on the knowledge of the forward operator and the geometry of the problem. The method is based on the spectral decomposition of an auxiliary matrix-function operator. The results are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Non-Locality induces Isometry and Factorisation in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holography, two manifestations of the black hole information paradox are given by the non-isometric nature of the bulk-boundary map and by the factorisation puzzle. By considering time-shifted microstates of the eternal black hole, we demonstrate that both these puzzles may be simultaneously resolved by taking into account non-local quantum corrections that correspond to wormholes arising from state averaging. This is achieved by showing, using a resolvent technique, that the resulting Hilbert space for an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space is finite-dimensional with a discrete energy spectrum. The latter gives rise to a transition to a type I von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Noise-adapted Quantum Error Correction for Non-Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quantum error correction (QEC) for non-Markovian noise. Using the well known Petz recovery map, we first show that conditions for approximate QEC can be easily generalized for the case of non-Markovian noise, in the strong coupling regime where the noise map becomes non-completely-positive at intermediate times. While certain approximate QEC schemes are ineffective against quantum non-Markovian noise, in the sense that the fidelity vanishes in finite time, the Petz map adapted to non-Markovian noise uniquely safeguards the code space even at the maximum noise limit. Focusing on the case of non-Markovian amplitude damping noise, we further show that the non-Markovian Petz map also outperforms the standard, stabilizer-based QEC code. Since implementing such a non-Markovian map poses practical challenges, we also construct a Markovian Petz map that achieves similar performance, with only a slight compromise on the fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benjamini, Yadin, and Yehudayoff (2007) showed that if the maximum degree of a graph $G$ is 'sub-logarithmic,' then the typical range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms is super-constant. Furthermore, they showed that there is a sharp transition on the range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms on the graph $C_{n,k}$, the tensor product of the $n$-cycle and the complete graph on $k$ vertices with self-loops, around $k=2\log n$. We extend (to some extent) their results to random $M$-Lipschitz functions and random real-valued Lipschitz functions.</description>

Abstract: A Skyrme type energy functional for maps $\varphi$ from an oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $M$ to a contact 3-manifold $N$ is defined, generalizing the BPS Skyrme energy of Ferreira and Zakrzewski. This energy has a topological lower bound, attained by solutions of a first order self-duality equation which we call (strong) Beltrami maps. In the case where $N$ is the 3-sphere, we show that the original Ferreira-Zakrzewski model (which has $N=S^3$ with the standard contact structure) can have no BPS solutions on $M=S^3$ with $|\mathrm{deg}(\varphi)|&gt;1$ if the coupling constant has the lowest admissible value.</description>

      <title>Letting the tiger out of its cage: bosonic coding without concatenation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-variable cat codes are encodings into a single photonic or phononic mode that offer a promising avenue for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. Protecting information in a cat code requires measuring the mode's occupation number modulo two, but this can be relaxed to a linear occupation-number constraint using the alternative two-mode pair-cat encoding. We construct multimode codes with similar linear constraints using any two integer matrices satisfying the homological condition of a quantum rotor code. Just like the pair-cat code, syndrome extraction can be performed in tandem with stabilizing dissipation using current superconducting-circuit designs. The framework includes codes with various finite- or infinite-dimensional codespaces, and codes with finite or infinite Fock-state support. It encompasses two-component cat, pair-cat, dual-rail, two-mode binomial, various bosonic repetition codes, and aspects of chi-squared encodings while also yielding codes from homological products, lattices, generalized coherent states, and algebraic varieties. Among our examples are analogues of repetition codes, the Shor code, and a surface-like code that is not a concatenation of a known cat code with the qubit surface code. Codewords are coherent states projected into a Fock-state subspace defined by an integer matrix, and their overlaps are governed by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries of quantum field theories are characterized by topological defects/operators organized into a higher category. In this paper we consider the Axion-Maxwell field theory in four dimensions and, building on the construction of its topological defects by Choi, Lam, Shao, Hidaka, Nitta and Yokokura, we discuss field theoretical methods to compute some aspects of the higher structure of such category. In particular, we determine explicitly the generalized $F$-symbols for the non-invertible electric 1-form symmetry of the theory. Along the way we clarify various aspects of the bottom-up worldvolume approach towards the calculus of defects.</description>

      <title>Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions: from landscape complexity to the deepest minimum value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form ${\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^2+\sum_{l=1}^M \phi_l({\bf k}_l\cdot {\bf x}), \, \, {\bf x}\in \mathbb{R}^N,\,\, \mu&gt;0 $ where both the functions $\phi_l(z)$ and vectors ${\bf k}_l$ are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of $M$ plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature $\mu$.
  Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the limit $N\to \infty, M\to \infty$ keeping $\alpha=M/N$ finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with $N$ of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of $\mu$ and $\alpha$: replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Properties of covariant Lyapunov vectors as continuous vector fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ``covariant Lyapunov field'', which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space of a dynamical system. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation presents a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation.</description>

The method of cluster expansions of the groups of operators of the Liouville equations for observables and a state is used to establish the generating operators of expansions representing solutions of the Cauchy problems of the BBGKY hierarchy (Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) as well as of the dual BBGKY hierarchy, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-commutative geometry has significantly contributed to quantum mechanics by providing mathematical tools to extract topological and geometrical information from these systems. This thesis explores the methods used by Jean Bellissard and collaborators for analyzing homogeneous materials. The focus is on two topological algebras that extend Fourier analysis over $\mathbb{T}^d$ to study tight-binding models for homogeneous materials. These algebras, generalizations of $C(\mathbb{T}^d)$ and $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^d)$, are considered anon-commutative smooth manifold, referred to as the Non-Commutative Brillouin Torus. Techniques from Fourier analysis, such as Fourier coefficients and Fej\'er summation, are adapted to this context, capturing the topological and smooth structure of the non-commutative manifold. The topological structure is represented by a C* algebra, while the smooth structure is captured by a smooth sub-algebra, forming the basis for constructing topological invariants of Hamiltonians through continuous cyclic cohomology.
  Additionally, the K theory of C* algebras and smooth sub-algebras is a crucial tool for studying topological invariants of Hamiltonians. Smooth sub-algebras share a functional calculus with C* algebras, providing sufficient information to study their K theory. This relationship is vital for identifying topological invariants of Hamiltonians, particularly under conditions like low temperature and electron density, which contribute to the quantization of transversal conductivity in homogeneous materials. This thesis aims to be a valuable resource for newcomers to the field.</description>

Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: [1] M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N. Nadirashvili. On the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on surfaces. Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48. [2] T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, P. Michor, and N. Nadirashvili. Bounds on the multiplicity of eigenvalues for fixed membranes. Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k(M))$ of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In [1], $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In [2], $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in [1,2] are not very detailed, and often rely on figures or special configurations of nodal sets. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof that $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected.</description>

Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Subregion-subalgebra duality: emergence of space and time in holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holographic duality, a higher dimensional quantum gravity system emerges from a lower dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with a large number of degrees of freedom. We propose a formulation of duality for a general causally complete bulk spacetime region, called subregion-subalgebra duality, which provides a framework to describe how geometric notions in the gravity system, such as spacetime subregions, different notions of times, and causal structure, emerge from the dual CFT. Subregion-subalgebra duality generalizes and brings new insights into subregion-subregion duality (or equivalently entanglement wedge reconstruction). It provides a mathematically precise definition of subregion-subregion duality and gives an independent definition of entanglement wedges without using entropy. Geometric properties of entanglement wedges, including those that play a crucial role in interpreting the bulk as a quantum error correcting code, can be understood from the duality as the geometrization of the superadditivity of certain algebras. Using general boundary subalgebras rather than those associated with geometric subregions makes it possible to find duals for general bulk spacetime regions, including those not touching the boundary. Applying subregion-subalgebra duality to a boundary state describing a single-sided black hole also provides a precise way to define mirror operators.</description>

      <title>Is mathematics a game?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the old question to what extent mathematics may be compared with a game, realizing that a "motley of language games" is the more refined object of comparison. Our analysis owes at least as much to (late) Wittgenstein, updated by a Brandomian emphasis that the rules governing language games be inferential, as to Hilbert, supplemented with some empiricism taken from van Fraassen. Our "motley" provides a coat rack onto which various philosophies of mathematics may be attached and may even peacefully support each other. Pure mathematics is a language game incorporating aspects of formalism and structuralism, modified however by a different notion of truth. Applied mathematics corresponds to a different language game in which mathematical theories provide generalized yardsticks that "measure" (as opposed to: represent) natural phenomena. Thus our framework is non-referential for both pure and applied mathematics. The certainty of pure mathematics in principle resides in proofs, but in practice these must be surveyable'. Hilbert and Wittgenstein proposed almost opposite criteria for surveyability; we try to overcome their difference.</description>

      <title>Gapless non-hydrodynamic modes in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide rigorous criteria to determine whether the non-hydrodynamic sector of a relativistic kinetic theory is gapless. These general criteria apply to both Boltzmann's equation and approximate models thereof, provided that the latter are consistent with thermodynamic principles. As an application of these criteria, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless whenever the scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. Physically, this happens because, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

      <title>A hidden symmetry of complex spacetime and the emergence of the standard model algebraic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When spacetime is considered as a subspace of a wider complex spacetime manifold, there is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups, the real and complex Poincar\'{e} groups. In particular, no spinors are allowed for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on principal bundles in complex spacetime, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure analogous to the one of the standard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equations of instanton moduli space for both algebraic one and the Okounkov-Smirnov geometric one is the Dubrovin connection for the instanton moduli space. As an application, we prove that the Maulik-Okounkov quantum algebra of Jordan type is isomorphic to the quantum toroidal algebra $U_{q_1,q_2}(\hat{\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$ up to some centres.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>
