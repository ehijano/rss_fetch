      <title>Certain infinite products in terms of MacMahon type series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ono and the third author discovered that the reciprocals of the theta series $(q;q)_\infty^3$ and $(q^2;q^2)_\infty(q;q^2)_\infty^2$ have infinitely many closed formulas in terms of MacMahon's quasimodular forms $A_k(q)$ and $C_k(q)$. In this article, we use the well-known infinite product identities due to Jacobi, Watson, and Hirschhorn to derive further such closed formulas for reciprocals of other interesting infinite products. Moreover, with these formulas, we approximate these reciprocals to arbitrary order simply using MacMahon's functions and {\it MacMahon type} functions. For example, let $\Theta_{6}(q):=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \chi_6(n) n q^{\frac{n^2-1}{24}}$ be the theta function corresponding to the odd quadratic character modulo $6$. Then for any positive integer $n$, we have $$\frac{1}{\Theta_{6}(q)}= q^{-\frac{3n^2+n}{2}}\sum_{\substack{k=r_1\\ k\equiv n\hspace{-0.2cm}\pmod{2}}}^{r_2}(-1)^{\frac{n-k}{2}}A_{k}(q)C_{\frac{3n-k}{2}}(q)+O(q^{n+1}),$$ where $r_1:=\lfloor\frac{3n-1-\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\rfloor+1$ and $r_2:=\lceil\frac{3n-1+\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\rceil-1$.</description>

      <title>The Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture with a moving target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the inhomogeneous generalization of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture in dimension $m \geq 3$. That is, given $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that $\sum (\varphi(q)\psi(q)/q)^m = \infty$, we show that for almost every $\mathbf{x} \in\mathbb{R}^m$ there are infinitely many rational vectors $\mathbf{a}/q$ such that $\vert q\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{y}\vert&lt;\psi(q)$ and such that each component of $\mathbf{a}$ is coprime to $q$. This is an inhomogeneous extension of a homogeneous conjecture of Sprind\v{z}uk which was itself proved in 1990 by Pollington and Vaughan. In fact, our main result generalizes Pollington-Vaughan not only to the inhomogeneous case, but also to the setting of moving targets, where the inhomogeneous parameter $\mathbf{y}$ is free to vary with $q$. In contrast, we show by an explicit construction that the (1-dimensional) inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture fails to hold with a moving target, implying that any successful attack on the one-dimensional problem must use the fact that the inhomogeneous parameter is constant. We also introduce new questions regarding moving targets.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of primes at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a variant of the Hardy--Littlewood prime $k$-tuple conjecture, we compute mixed moments of the number of primes in disjoint short intervals and short progressions respectively. This involves estimating the mean of singular series over any product of lattices, which is of independent interest. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of both sequences of suitably normalized primes to a standard Poisson point process.</description>

      <title>A Continued Fractions Theory for the completion of the Puiseux field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a continued fractions theory for the topological completion of the field of Puiseux series. As usual, we prove that any element in the completion can be developed as a unique continued fractions, whose coefficients are polynomials in roots of the variable, and that this approximation is the best ''rational'' Diophantine approximation of such element. Then, we interpret the preceding result in terms of the action of a suitable arithmetic subgroup of the special linear group on the Berkovich space defined over the said completion. We also explore the connections between points of type IV of the Berkovich space in terms of some ''non-convergent'' or ''undefined'' continued fractions, in a sense that we make precise in the text.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic of polynomials over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterparts of several classical results of number theory are proven for the ring of polynomials with coefficients in a number field. A theorem of Milnor that determines the Witt ring of a function field is applied to prove an analogue of Gauss's principal genus theorem for binary quadratic forms with polynomial coefficients. This is used to help understand when and why quadratic reciprocity fails in these polynomial rings. Another application is a count of the number of cyclic subgroups whose order is divisible by four in the primary decomposition of the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of certain hyperelliptic curves. Invariant theory is applied to prove an analogue of a classical theorem of Fueter to give criteria for an elliptic curve with a polynomial discriminant and zero $j$-invariant to have no affine points over the associated function field.</description>

      <title>On the analytic theory of isotropic ternary quadratic forms II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this work \cite{Du}, a quantitative supplement to the Hasse principle was given for the count of the number of automorphic orbits of primitive zeros of a genus of ternary quadratic forms. This sequel contains, for certain special forms, an independent and elementary proof of this result. When combined with other results of \cite{Du}, this proof also leads to a refinement of an asymptotic result of \cite{Du} and some corollaries for these special forms.</description>

      <title>Enumerating places of $\mathbf P^1$ up to automorphisms of $\mathbf P^1$ in quasilinear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that, for every fixed degree $n\ge 3$, will enumerate all degree-$n$ places of the projective line over a finite field $k$ up to the natural action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ using $O(\log q)$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Since there are $\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of degree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The algorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis, because its complexity depends on that of polynomial factorization: for odd $n$, it involves factoring $\Theta(q^{n-3})$ polynomials over $k$ of degree up to ${1 + ((n-1)/2)^n}$.
  For composite degrees $n$, earlier work of the author gives an algorithm for enumerating $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ orbit representatives for degree-$n$ places of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over $k$ that runs in time $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ independent of the extended Riemann hypothesis, but that uses $O(q^{n-3})$ space.
  We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one another; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends on enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly compute the Rankin-Selberg type integral introduced by Piatetski-Shapiro over adeles for vector-valued Siegel cusp forms of square-free levels $\Gamma_0(N)$. On the way, for particular test functions in the Bessel models of irreducible admissible representations, exact evaluations of the local zeta-integrals are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simplified proof of Jia's 1996 result which states that the interval $[n, n+n^{\frac{1}{20}+\varepsilon}]$ contains prime numbers for almost all $n$. Furthermore, we show that for almost all $n$, the shorter interval $[n, n+n^{\frac{1}{21}+\varepsilon}]$ still contains prime numbers. A delicate sieve decomposition and more accurate estimates for integrals are used to good effect.</description>

      <title>A naive integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2406.0243 two real functions $g(x,t)$ and $f(x,t)$ are defined, so that the Riemann-Siegel $Z$ function is given as \[Z(t)=\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{u(t)e^{\frac{\pi i}{8}}}{\frac12+it}\int_0^\infty g(x,t)e^{i f(x,t)}\,dt\Bigr\},\] where $u(t)$ is a real function of order $t^{-1/4}$ when $t\to+\infty$. The function $g(x,t)$ is indefinitely differentiable and tends to $0$ as well as all its derivatives when $x\to0^+$ or $x\to+\infty$. Since, furthermore, for $t\to+\infty$ the function $f(x,t)$ tends to $+\infty$ we may expect that the integral depends essentially on the behavior of $g(x,t)$ at the extremes.
  As Polya in an analogous situation we consider the substitution of $\psi(x)$ by a simpler similar function. A simple function with this behavior is \[\psi_0(x):=2\pi(1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-5/2})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}.\] Therefore, we define $J_0(t)$ replacing in the definition of $J(t)$ the function $\psi(x)$ by the simpler $\psi_0(x)$. \begin{equation} J_0(t)=2\pi\int_0^\infty (1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-\frac52})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}(1-ix)^{\frac12(\frac12+it)}\,dx. \end{equation} The resulting $Z_0(t)$ disappoints us \[Z_0(t)\asymp \mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\exp\Bigl\{i\Bigl(\frac{t}{2}\log\frac{t}{2\pi}-\frac{t}{2}-\frac{\pi}{8}\Bigr)\Bigr\}+\frac{2}{(2\pi t)^{1/4}}\exp\Bigl(\pi i\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\;\Bigr)\Bigr\},\quad t\to+\infty.\] However, the integral $J_0(t)$ is interesting as a technical challenge. And still we have the possibility to get a better result improving $\psi_0(x)$.
  This is a preliminary version, and we set it as a challenge: to compute and study this integral.</description>

      <title>Expressions for weight 2 cusp forms in holomorphic eta quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to compute expressions in terms of the Dedekind eta function for all weight 2 new cusp forms with level up to 100, using methods of Allen et. al. In cases where no expression exists, we raise the level instead of the weight, meaning our eta quotients are always holomorphic. Of the forms we examine, we find expressions for all but 4. We also present methods to find expressions with relatively few terms, and how these expressions can be used to demonstrate zeroes of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Level one automorphic representations of an anisotropic exceptional group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of type $\mathrm{F}_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Up to isomorphism, there is a unique connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of Lie type $\mathrm{F}_{4}$, with compact real points and split over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ for all primes $p$. Let $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ be such a group. In this paper, we study the level one automorphic representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ in the spirit of the work of Chenevier, Renard, and Ta\"ibi. First, we give an explicit formula for the number of these representations having any given archimedean component. For this, we study the automorphism group of the two definite exceptional Jordan algebras of rank $27$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ studied by Gross, as well as the dimension of the invariants of these groups in all irreducible representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, assuming standard conjectures by Arthur and Langlands for $\mathbf{F}_{4}$, we refine this counting by studying the contribution of the representations whose global Arthur parameter has any possible image (or "Sato-Tate group"). This includes a detailed description of all those images, as well as precise statements for the Arthur's multiplicity formula in each case. As a consequence, we obtain a conjectural but explicit formula for the number of algebraic, cuspidal, level one automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_{26}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with Sato-Tate group $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$ of any given weight (assumed "$\mathrm{F}_{4}$-regular"). The first example of such representations occurs in motivic weight $36$.</description>

      <title>Cocycles for Kottwitz cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his work on defining the pointed set B(G) for all local and global fields, Kottwitz introduced certain Galois gerbes and considered their 'algebraic' cohomology with values in algebraic groups. However, the gerbes so constructed are only canonical up to conjugation by their bands. This is enough in order to ensure that the cohomology set B(G) is canonical, but not enough data to pin down the set of algebraic cocycles used to compute the set B(G). For arithmetic applications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these cocycles readily at hand. To this end we propose in this paper a framework with which to work with such spaces of algebraic Kottwitz cocycles. This will play a crucial role in our forthcoming work on the formalism of Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the lattice-theoretic approach of Brandhorst--Cattaneo to classify algebraically trivial actions on the known IHS manifolds, up to deformation and birational conjugacy. In particular, we classify even order algebraically trivial non symplectic automorphisms, with or without trivial discriminant action. In the case of nontrivial discriminant actions, we show that such automorphisms exist only for finitely many known deformation types and orders.</description>

Using our methods, we obtain a new infinite family of optimal rank-metric codes with rank-locality, i.e. every code in our family achieves the information theoretical bound for rank-metric codes with rank-locality.</description>

      <title>A multi-Frey approach to Fermat equations of signature $(r,r,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.06530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a resolution of the generalized Fermat equations $$x^5 + y^5 = 3 z^n \text{ and } x^{13} + y^{13} = 3 z^n,$$ for all integers $n \ge 2$, and all integers $n \ge 2$ which are not a multiple of $7$, respectively, using the modular method with Frey elliptic curves over totally real fields. The results require a refined application of the multi-Frey technique, which we show to be effective in new ways to reduce the bounds on the exponents $n$.
  We also give a number of results for the equations $x^5 + y^5 = d z^n$, where $d = 1, 2$, under additional local conditions on the solutions. This includes a result which is reminiscent of the second case of Fermat's Last Theorem, and which uses a new application of level raising at $p$ modulo $p$.</description>

      <title>Rational self-affine tiles associated to standard and nonstandard digit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider digit systems $(A,\mathcal{D})$, where $ A \in \mathbb{Q}^{n\times n}$ is an expanding matrix and the digit set $\mathcal{D}$ is a suitable subset of $\mathbb{Q}^n$. To such a system, we associate a self-affine set $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(A,\mathcal{D})$ that lives in a certain representation space $\mathbb{K}$. If $A$ is an integer matrix, then $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}^n$, while in the general rational case $\mathbb{K}$ contains an additional solenoidal factor. We give a criterion for $\mathcal{F}$ to have positive Haar measure, i.e., for being a rational self-affine tile. We study topological properties of $\mathcal{F}$ and prove some tiling theorems. Our setting is very general in the sense that we allow $(A,\mathcal{D})$ to be a nonstandard digit system. A standard digit system $(A,\mathcal{D})$ is one in which we require $\mathcal{D}$ to be a complete system of residue class representatives w.r.t. a certain naturally chosen residue class ring. Our tools comprise the Frobenius normal form and character theory of locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Effective multiplicative independence of 3 singular moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pila and Tsimerman proved in 2017 that for every $k$ there exists at most finitely many $k$-tuples $(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ of distinct non-zero singular moduli with the property "$x_1, \ldots,x_k$ are multiplicatively dependent, but any proper subset of them is multiplicatively independent". The proof was non-effective, using Siegel's lower bound for the Class Number. In 2019 Riffaut obtained an effective version of this result for $k=2$. Moreover, he determined all the instances of $x^my^n\in \mathbb Q^\times$, where $x,y$ are distinct singular moduli and $m,n$ non-zero integers. In this article we obtain a similar result for $k=3$. We show that $x^my^nz^r\in \mathbb Q^\times$ (where $x,y,z$ are distinct singular moduli and $m,n,r$ non-zero integers) implies that the discriminants of $x,y,z$ do not exceed $10^{10}$.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture, recently stated by Flach and Morin, relates the action of the monodromy on the Galois invariant part of the p-adic Beilinson-Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the generic fiber of a scheme defined over a DVR of mixed characteristic to (the cohomology of) its special fiber. We prove the conjecture in the case the special fiber, of the given arithmetic scheme, is also a fiber of a geometric family over a curve in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Etale descent obstruction and anabelian geometry of curves over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ and $D$ be smooth, proper and geometrically integral curves over a finite field $F$. Any morphism from $D$ to $C$ induces a morphism of their \'etale fundamental groups. The anabelian philosophy proposed by Grothendieck suggests that, when $C$ has genus at least $2$, all open homomorphisms between the \'etale fundamental groups should arise in this way from a nonconstant morphism of curves. We relate this expectation to the arithmetic of the curve $C_K$ over the global function field $K = F(D)$. Specifically, we show that there is a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of well-behaved morphism of fundamental groups and locally constant adelic points of $C_K$ that survive \'etale descent. We use this to provide further evidence for the anabelian conjecture by relating it to another recent conjecture by Sutherland and the second author.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Ramanujan's identity for Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his second notebook, Ramanujan discovered the following identity for the special values of $\zeta(s)$ at the odd positive integers \begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}\alpha^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\alpha n} - 1}\right\} &amp;-(- \beta)^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\beta n} - 1}\right\}\nonumber &amp;=2^{2m}\sum_{k = 0}^{m + 1}\dfrac{\left(-1\right)^{k-1}B_{2k}\,B_{2m - 2k+2}}{\left(2k\right)!\left(2m -2k+2\right)!}\,\alpha^{m - k + 1}\beta^k \label{(1.2)},\end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are positive numbers such that $ \alpha\beta = \pi^2 $ and $ m $ is a positive integer. As shown by Berndt in the viewpoint of general transformation of analytic Eisenstein series, it is a natural companion of Euler's famous formula for even zeta values. In this note, we prove an analogue of the above Ramanujan's identity in the functions fields setting, which involves the Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Formal Siegel modular forms for arithmetic subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of formal Siegel modular forms for an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of the symplectic group of genus $n$ is a generalization of symmetric formal Fourier-Jacobi series. Assuming an upper bound on the affine covering number of the Siegel modular variety associated with $\Gamma$, we prove that all formal Siegel modular forms are given by Fourier-Jacobi expansions of classical holomorphic Siegel modular forms. We also show that the required upper bound is always met if $2\leq n \leq 4$. As an application we consider the case of the paramodular group of squarefree level and genus $2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\tau_k$ be the $k$-fold divisor function. By constructing an approximant of $\tau_k$, denoted as $\tau_k^*$, which is a normalized truncation of the $k$-fold divisor function, we prove that when $\exp\left(C\log^{1/2}X(\log\log X)^{1/2}\right)\leq H\leq X$ and $C&gt;0$ is sufficiently large, the following estimate holds for almost all $x\in[X,2X]$: \[ \Big|\sum_{x&lt;n\leq x+H}(\tau_k(n)-\tau_k^*(n)) e(\alpha_dn^d+\cdots+\alpha_1n)\Big|=o(H\log^{k-1}X), \] where $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d\in \mathbb{R}$ are arbitrary frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the modular differential equation $y''+s\,E_4\, y=0$ where $E_4$ is the weight 4 Eisenstein series and $s=\pi^2r^2$ with $r=n/m$ being a rational number in reduced form such that $m\geq 7$. This study is carried out by solving the associated Schwarzian equation $\{h,\tau\}=2\,s\,E_4$ and using the theory of equivariant functions on the upper half-plane and the 2-dimensional vector-valued modular forms. The solutions are expressed in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric series. This completes the study of the above-mentioned modular differential equation of the associated Schwarzian equation given that the cases $1\leq m\leq 6$ have already been treated in the litterature.</description>

      <title>Toric ranks and component groups of modular curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p\neq{2,3}$ be a prime number and let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ be a congruence subgroup with modular curve $X_{\Gamma}/K$ and Jacobian $J(X_{\Gamma})$. In this paper we give an explicit group-theoretic description of the semistable toric rank and component group of $J(X_{\Gamma})$ at the finite places of $K$ lying over $p$. We first produce a suitable deformation retract of the minimal Berkovich skeleton of $X_{\Gamma}$ in terms of Hecke-Iwahori double coset spaces. We call this deformation retract the pruned skeleton of the curve. Our description of this skeleton includes a group-theoretic formula for the edge lengths, allowing us to give the component group of the modular curve as the quotient of a lattice using the monodromy pairing. For $X_{0}(N)$, $X_{1}(N)$, $X_{sp}(N)$ and $X_{sp}^{+}(N)$, we explicitly determine the pruned skeleta using a set of coset schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. This in particular recovers results by Deligne-Rapoport, Edixhoven, Coleman-McMurdy and Tsushima on the semistable reduction type of $X_{0}(p^{n})$ for $n\leq{4}$. Finally, we determine the geometric Tamagawa number and the prime-to-$2$ structure of the component group of $X_{0}(N)$ over the extension given by Krir's theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that if $(U_n)_{n\ge 1}$ is any nondegenerate linearly recurrent sequence of integers whose general term is up to sign not a polynomial in $n$, then the inequality $\phi(|U_n|)\ge |U_{\phi(n)}|$ holds on a set of positive integers $n$ of density $1$, where $\phi$ is the Euler function. In fact, we show that the set of $n\le x$ for which the above inequality fails has counting function $O_U(x/\log x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove asymptotic formulae for small weighted solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $\lambda_1x_1^2+\cdots +\lambda_nx_n^2\equiv \lambda_{n+1}\bmod{p^m}$, where $p$ is a fixed odd prime, $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_{n+1}$ are integer coefficients such that $(\lambda_1\cdots \lambda _{n},p)=1$ and $m\rightarrow \infty$. If $n\ge 6$, $p\ge 5$ and the coefficients are fixed and satisfy $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n&gt;0$ and $(\lambda_{n+1},p)=1$ (inhomogeneous case), we obtain an asymptotic formula which is valid for integral solutions $(x_1,...,x_n)$ in cubes of side length at least $p^{(1/2+\varepsilon)m}$, centered at the origin. If $n\ge 4$ and $\lambda_{n+1}=0$ (homogeneous case), we prove a result of the same strength for coefficients $\lambda_i$ which are allowed to vary with $m$. These results extend previous results of the first- and the third-named authors and N. Bag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bidirected graphs are multigraphs where every edge has an independent direction at each end. In the paper, with an arbitrary bidirected graph we associate a non-negative integral quadratic form (called the incidence form of the graph), and determine all forms that appear in this way in two main results: first, among non-negative connected unit forms, precisely those of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ or $\mathbb{D}$ are incidence forms; second, we give simple conditions on the coefficients of a non-negative connected non-unitary form to be an incidence form. We say that those non-unitary forms have Dynkin type $\mathbb{C}$, and justify such nomenclature by generalizing known classifications and properties of non-negative quadratic forms of Dynkin types $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ to the introduced type~$\mathbb{C}$. We also show that the graphical framework of an incidence form is an useful tool to visualize its arithmetical properties, to prove new facts and to perform efficient computations for integral quadratic forms and related problems in number theory, algebra and graph theory. For instance, in a third main result we relate the walks of a bidirected graph with the $0,1,2$-roots of the associated incidence form (and to the classical root systems in the positive case). Moreover, we prove the universality property for a large class of integral quadratic forms, provide computational methods to find solutions or to characterize the finiteness of the sets of solutions of various related Diophantine equations, show a variant of Whitney's theorem on line graphs using switching classes, and apply our techniques to give a conceptual and constructive proof of the non-negativity (and possible Dynkin types) of the Euler quadratic forms of a class of finite-dimensional gentle algebras.</description>
