      <title>Geometric Bounds for Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we bring a new perspective to persistent homology by incorporating key concepts from metric geometry. For a given compact subset $X$ of a Banach space $Y$, we study the topological features appearing in family $N_\bullet(X\subset Y)$ of nested of neighborhoods of $X$ in $Y$ and give several geometric bounds on their persistence (lifespans).
  First, we discuss the lifespans of these homology classes in terms of their filling radii in $Y$. By using this, we relate these lifespans to key invariants in metric geometry such as Urysohn width. Next, we bound these lifespans via $\ell^\infty$-principal components of the set $X$, which are also known as Kolmogorov widths. Furthermore, we introduce and study the notion of extinction time of a space $X$: the critical threshold after which there are no homological features alive in any degree. We also describe novel approaches on how to estimate \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips extinction times of a set $X$ by relating $X$ to its \"uber-contractible cores and to its tight span, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the group cohomology of groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ free of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit computation of the cohomology groups (with untwisted coefficients) of semidirect products of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ free of squares, by means of formulas that only depend on $n$, $m$ and the action of $\mathbb{Z}/m$ on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We want to highlight the fact that we are not impossing any conditions on the $\mathbb{Z}/m$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and as far as we know our formulas are the first in the literature in this generality. This generalizes previous computations of L\"uck-Davis and Adem-Ge-Pan-Petrosyan. In order to show that our formulas are usable, we develop a concrete example of the form $\mathbb{Z}^5\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ where its cohomology groups are described in full detail.</description>

      <title>Commuting Varieties of Upper Triangular Matrices and Representation Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between commuting varieties $C_g(G)$ (potentially of higher genus), which are associated with a group scheme $G$ consisting of upper triangular matrices, and the representation homology $HR_*(\Sigma_g,G)$ of a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ with coefficients in the group $G$. As an outcome, we provide a numerical criterion for determining whether commuting varieties $C(U_n)$ form a complete intersection for groups consisting of upper triangular unipotent matrices.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.</description>

      <title>The Braid Indices of Pretzel Links: A Comprehensive Study, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the braid index of an oriented link is generally a hard problem. In the case of alternating links, some significant progresses have been made in recent years which made explicit and precise braid index computations possible for links from various families of alternating links, including the family of all alternating Montesinos links. However, much less is known for non-alternating links. For example, even for the non-alternating pretzel links, which are special (and simpler) Montesinos links, the braid index is only known for a very limited few special cases. In this paper and its sequel, we study the braid indices for all non-alternating pretzel links by a systematic approach. We classify the pretzel links into three different types according to the Seifert circle decompositions of their standard link diagrams. More specifically, if $D$ is a standard diagram of an oriented pretzel link $\mathcal{L}$, $S(D)$ is the Seifert circle decomposition of $D$, and $C_1$, $C_2$ are the Seifert circles in $S(D)$ containing the top and bottom long strands of $D$ respectively, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 1 (Type 2) pretzel link if $C_1\not=C_2$ and $C_1$, $C_2$ have different (identical) orientations. In the case that $C_1=C_2$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 3 pretzel link. In this paper, we present the results of our study on Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. Our results allow us to determine the precise braid index for any non-alternating Type 1 or Type 2 pretzel link. Since the braid indices are already known for all alternating pretzel links from our previous work, it means that we have now completely determined the braid indices for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links.</description>

      <title>Some Observations on projective Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the upper characteristic rank of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$ and of the flip Stiefel manifolds. We provide bounds for the cup lengths of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for existence of $S^3$-map between quarternionic Stiefel manifolds using Fadell-Husseini index.</description>

      <title>Wrapping Cycles in Delaunay Complexes: Bridging Persistent Homology and Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology in the context of shape reconstruction methods. Specifically, we consider the construction of Wrap complexes, introduced by Edelsbrunner as a subcomplex of the Delaunay complex, and the construction of lexicographic optimal homologous cycles, also considered by Cohen-Steiner, Lieutier, and Vuillamy in a similar setting. We show that for any cycle in a Delaunay complex for a given radius parameter, the lexicographically optimal homologous cycle is supported on the Wrap complex for the same parameter, thereby establishing a close connection between the two methods. We obtain this result by establishing a fundamental connection between reduction of cycles in the computation of persistent homology and gradient flows in the algebraic generalization of discrete Morse theory.</description>
