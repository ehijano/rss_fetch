      <title>Proper Motion of the Neutron Star in the Supernova Remnant G18.9-1.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct measurement of the proper motion of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.9-1.1 using a 15-year Chandra baseline. After correcting the observations' astrometric solutions using reference Gaia stars' positions, we measure a total proper motion of 24.7 $\pm$ 6.8 mas yr$^{-1}$ at an angle of $336^\circ \pm$ 16$^\circ$ east of north. Using the distance estimates from literature of 2.1 kpc and 3.8 kpc, this proper motion corresponds to Galactic rotation-corrected transverse velocities of 264d$_{2.1}$ $\pm$ 79 km s$^{-1}$ and 474d$_{3.8}$ $\pm$ 129 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Our power ratio method analysis of SNR ejecta slightly favors the higher velocity, as multipole moments calculated from the back-evolved center using the farther distance are more consistent with values from other CCSNRs. The NS's motion is directly opposite the motion of bulk ejecta in G18.9$-$1.1, providing yet more evidence that NS kicks are generated via a conservation of momentum-like process between the NS and the ejecta, as has been observed in other SNRs.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes and their surroundings: MeV signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is
  highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron
  star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry
  energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges
  that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable
  properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their
  variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian
  rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$.
  In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness,
  as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality,
  with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters.
  These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling
  of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant
  variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.</description>

      <title>Heavy element nucleosynthesis in rotating proto-magnetar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r-$process) is a long standing mystery. The hot and dense environments of core-collapse supernovae have been suggested as potential $r-$process sites, particularly the neutrino-driven wind from the newly-born protoneutron star (PNS). Wind models that neglect the potential effects of strong magnetic fields and/or rapid rotation of the PNS typically fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third $r-$process peak, but robustly produce a limited or weak $r-$process for neutron-rich winds. Axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rotating and non-rotating PNS winds with magnetar-strength fields reveal that high entropy material is quasi-periodically ejected from the equatorial closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere. Here, we post-process tracer particle trajectories from these simulations using a nuclear reaction network in order to explore the resulting nucleosynthesis across a range of PNS magnetic field strengths, rotation rates, and neutrino luminosities (cooling phase after core-bounce). We find that a robust $r-$process up to and beyond the third peak is generic to magnetar birth, even for magnetic fields as weak as $\sim 5\times 10^{14}$ G. Depending on the distribution of magnetic field strengths and rotation at birth, we estimate that magnetized PNS winds could account for $\sim 5-100\%$ of the Galactic $r-$process inventory, extending up to the third peak. The robust $r-$process in our calculations is accompanied by overproduction of elements with mass number $\rm A\lesssim 120$ compared to the Solar abundances. We also find that $^{92}\rm Mo$ (a $p-$isotope) is produced in significant quantities in neutron-rich winds.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Collisional Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc ornax}. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI {(hCFI)} modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation {leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. {As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation,} the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group {hCFI} are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like {hCFI}. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like {hCFI} into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by {hCFI} modes are in general small.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength variability analysis of the blazar S5 0716+714 during a long-lasting period of low activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the blazar S5 0716+714 from 2022 November 26 to 2023 May 28 using optical telescopes in Egypt and Bulgaria. Data were taken during 84 nights in 11 of which intranight monitoring was performed. We also use optical and gamma-ray survey data. On long-term time-scales, we find a gradual decrease of the S5 0716+714 activity since the beginning of 2020 in both optical and gamma-rays. On short-term time-scales, the individual optical light curves are strongly correlated among each other with no time lags observed. The V-band percentage variability amplitude equals 97.59 +/- 0.02 per cent. We find moderate flatter-when-brighter spectral behaviour with the strength of the 'spectral index - flux' anti-correlation decreasing towards the longer wavelengths. The main feature of the short-term light curves is a transient quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 43.5 +/- 3.6 d. The V-band light curve is modelled with two helically moving blobs and a synchrotron flare. We estimate the resulting parameters, as well as limits on the radius, magnetic field strength, and electron Lorentz factor of the region responsible for the flare. On intranight time-scales, we find smooth flux variations with no flares and derive a duty cycle in the range ~10-20 per cent. The lack of flares on intranight time-scales could result from a temporarily homogeneous jet flow without formation of turbulent cells in terms of prevented Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The analysis of the data reveals a low activity of S5 0716+714 on all time-scales during the observation period.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Compact Object Binaries in the Lower Mass Gap with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Leptohadronic Modeling of Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its proximity, Markarian 421 is one of the most extensively studied jetted active galactic nuclei. Its spectral energy distribution and light curve are widely studied, serving as primary means for understanding jet radiation mechanisms. Numerous intriguing observational results have been discovered, some of which, such as the hard X-ray excess, and the associated variability between X-ray and very-high-energy (VHE) emissions, challenge the commonly adopted one-zone leptonic model. In this work, by establishing a time-dependent leptohadronic model, we explore whether the hard X-ray excess and the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions could be interpreted by emission from hadronic interactions. Our modeling finds that for the hard X-ray excess found in 2013, both of the secondary emissions from photohadronic and hadronuclear interactions could be a possible explanation for the hard X-ray excess without introducing a super-Eddington jet power. The emission from the photohadronic interactions contributes only to the hard X-ray band, while the hadronuclear interactions also predict VHE emissions associated with the hard X-rays. While for the hard X-ray excess found in 2016, only the secondary emissions from photohadronic interactions provide an interpretation at the cost of introducing a super-Eddington jet power. For the associated variability between X-ray and VHE emissions in 2017, we find that hadronic interactions fail to provide a possible interpretation.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.</description>

      <title>Supernova Remnants with M dwarf surviving companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility that Type Ia supernovae might be produced by binary systems where the companion of the exploding white dwarf is an M-dwarf star. Such companion would appear as a runaway star, retaining its pre-explosion orbital velocity along with a kick imparted by the supernova ejecta. It might be rapidly rotating, from being tidally locked with the white dwarf prior to explosion in a very close binary. For this study, we perform a series of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the interaction between M-dwarf companions and SN ejecta, followed by post-impact stellar evolution modeling using the MESA code. Our initial models in the 3D simulations had high spin angular momenta and the effects of magnetic braking have been included. They very significantly reduce the final rotation.
  A surviving companion candidate, MV-G272, has recently been discovered in the supernova remnant G272.2-3.2, which is an 8.9$\sigma$ proper motion outlier, although being slowly rotating. Our results show that the properties of this companion (luminosity, effective temperature, surface gravity) can be reproduced by our post-impact M-dwarf models. The slow rotation, which is a common characteristic with several proposed hypervelocity SN companions, can be explained by magnetic braking during the post-impact evolution, thus supporting the possibility that the MV-G272 star is the surviving companion of the Type Ia supernova now found as G272.2-3.2 SNR.</description>

      <title>Slow Stable Self-bound Hybrid Star Can Relieve All Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Spectral Learning of Magnetized Plasma Dynamics: A Neural Operator Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier neural operators (FNOs) provide a mesh-independent way to learn solution operators for partial differential equations, yet their efficacy for magnetized turbulence is largely unexplored. Here we train an FNO surrogate for the 2-D Orszag-Tang vortex, a canonical non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) benchmark, across an ensemble of viscosities and magnetic diffusivities. On unseen parameter settings the model achieves a mean-squared error of $\approx 6 \times 10^{-3}$ in velocity and $\approx 10^{-3}$ in magnetic field, reproduces energy spectra and dissipation rates within $96\%$ accuracy, and retains temporal coherence over long timescales. Spectral analysis shows accurate recovery of large- and intermediate-scale structures, with degradation at the smallest resolved scales due to Fourier-mode truncation. Relative to a UNet baseline the FNO cuts error by $97\%$, and compared with a high-order finite-volume solver it delivers a $25\times$ inference speed-up, offering a practical path to rapid parameter sweeps in MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Mass Composition Around the Knee via PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental data recorded by the KASCADE experiment to reconstruct the mass composition of cosmic rays around the \textit{knee} region. A set of four extensive air shower parameters sensitive to the primary particle mass ($LCm$, $N_{\mu}$, $N_{e}$, and lateral shower $age$) was considered, whose coordinates were transformed into a new orthogonal basis that maximally captures the data variance. Based on the experimental distributions of the first two principal components (PCA0 vs.\ PCA1) and full Monte Carlo simulations of the KASCADE array considering five types of primary particles (p, He, C, Si, and Fe) and three hadronic interaction models (EPOS-LHC, QGSjet-II-04, and SIBYLL~2.3d), we obtained the evolution of the abundance of each primary species as a function of energy, as well as the evolution of the mean logarithmic mass with energy. We found that the reconstruction of the mass composition resulting from this comprehensive analysis significantly reduces dependence on the hadronic interaction model used in the simulation process, even though the initial input parameters are model-dependent. Moreover, the results support the idea that around the \textit{knee} region, the abundance of the light component (protons) decreases, while the heavy component shows a slight increase. The evolution of $\langle \ln A \rangle$ as a function of energy derived from this analysis shows excellent agreement with recent results from the LHAASO--KM2A experiment and aligns very well with the predictions of the data-driven GSF astrophysical model.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Coma Cluster Dark Matter and the Unresolved {\gamma}-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.</description>

      <title>The environment of TeV halo progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeV halos are extended very-high-energy gamma-ray sources found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding which type of medium pulsars are probing over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions, where they receive a natal kick, until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors, for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess in which medium pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derive the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population, and then apply the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the ISM at around 200 kyr, significantly later than the values most commonly used in the literature. The majority of known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. In order to test this idea, we provide the probability of still residing in the parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over six seasons using cascade events from the Baikal-GVD expanding telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using Baikal-GVD cascade data collected between April 2018 to March 2024. In this period, the detector grew from 15% to 55% of its baseline cubic kilometer configuration. The diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux is detected with a statistical significance of 5.1 $\sigma$. Assuming a single power law model of the astrophysical neutrino flux with identical contribution from each neutrino flavor, the following best-fit parameter values are found: the spectral index $\gamma_{astro}$ = 2.64$^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$ and the flux normalization $\phi_{astro}$ = 4.42$^{+2.31}_{-1.29}\times10^{-18} \text{GeV}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ per one flavor at 100 TeV. These results are broadly consistent with IceCube measurements.</description>

      <title>Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 &lt; q&lt;1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $&gt; 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.</description>

      <title>New avenues for the neutrino dipole portal exploration at the energy frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and gauge-invariant study of the neutrino dipole portal at the energy frontier. Assuming negligible active-sterile mixing, we analyze sterile neutrino production via dimension-6 dipole operators coupling to the electroweak field strengths. The analysis incorporates, for the first time, both single- and double-gauge-boson effective interactions. We investigate novel collider signatures at the HL-LHC, the FCC-hh -- studied here in this context for the first time -- and a 10 TeV muon collider. Particular emphasis is placed on electroweak boson-initiated processes, which dominate in the high-mass regime above $\sim$1 TeV. At the muon collider, these VBF-like topologies enable production even when the dipole couples to non-muonic flavors, offering a unique and sensitive probe for different flavor scenarios. We derive sensitivity projections for various theoretical benchmarks, reaching dipole couplings down to $d_{\gamma}\sim 6\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at FCC-hh and $d_{\gamma}\sim 2\times10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at the muon collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planned space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA, will provide a fundamentally new means of studying the orbital alignment of close white dwarf binaries. However, due to the inherent symmetry of their gravitational wave signals, a fourfold degeneracy arises in the transverse projections of their angular momentum vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that by incorporating timing information from electromagnetic observations, such as radial velocity modulations and light curves, this degeneracy can be reduced to twofold.</description>

      <title>Calibrating $\rm{DM_{IGM}}-z$ relation using host galaxies of FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients that offer valuable insight of intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by IGM ($\rm{DM_{IGM}}$) is degenerated with that from the host galaxy ($\rm{DM_{host}}$), necessitating calibration of the $\rm{DM_{IGM}}$$-z$ relation for cosmological applications. As $\rm{DM_{host}}$ is expected to correlate with host galaxy properties, it is feasible to estimate $\rm{DM_{host}}$ from observable host characteristics. In this study, we conduct spectral energy distribution (SED) and S\'ersic model fittings to derive the parameters of FRB host galaxies. Then, we examine the correlations between the excess dispersion measure ($\rm{DM_{exc}}$) and host galaxy parameters, including star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR), inclination angle, and projected area. A tight correlation between $\rm{DM_{exc}}$ and sSFR is found. This correlation is utilized to estimate the $\rm{DM_{host}}$ of FRBs, providing a method to calibrate the DM$_{\rm IGM}-z$ relation. This approach leads to a notable improvement in calibration performance.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process framework for testing general relativity with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy provides a promising avenue for the discovery of new physics beyond general relativity as it probes extreme curvature and ultra-relativistic dynamics. However, in the absence of a compelling alternative to general relativity, it is difficult to carry out an analysis that allows for a wide range of deviations. To that end, we introduce a Gaussian process framework to search for deviations from general relativity in gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers with minimal assumptions. We employ a kernel that enforces our prior beliefs that - if gravitational waveforms deviate from the predictions of general relativity - the deviation is likely to be localised in time near the merger with some characteristic frequency. We demonstrate this formalism with simulated data and apply it to events from Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3. We find no evidence for a deviation from general relativity. We limit the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to as low as 7% (90% credibility) of the strain of GW190701_203306.</description>

      <title>Impact of a granular mass distribution on the orbit of S2 in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Quiescent Black Hole Population of Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the Habitable World Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments. Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonlocal gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Pad\'e approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Sub-keV dark matter can strongly ionize molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ionization of dense molecular clouds can be used to set strong constraints on dark matter models producing UV/X-ray photons in their annihilation or decay. We place robust and competitive constraints on various dark matter models, such as axion-like particles, scalars and sterile neutrinos, for masses between $\sim30$~eV and $10$~keV, and project forecasts to illustrate the potential of this target. We discuss how these constraints can be significantly improved by considering a more refined sample of molecular clouds near the Galactic Center and above the Galactic plane, a detailed modeling of the cosmic-ray ionization contribution and, potentially, a more refined analysis of the gas density in clouds through dust extinction maps. Thus, ionization of molecular clouds emerges as one of the most powerful tools for probing sub-keV dark matter.</description>

      <title>PixelPop: High Resolution Nonparameteric Inference of Gravitational-Wave Populations in Multiple Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric analysis of correlations in the binary black hole population with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formation channels of merging compact binaries imprint themselves on the distributions and correlations of their source parameters, but current understanding of this population is hindered by simplified parametric models. We overcome such limitations using PixelPop [Heinzel et al. (2025)]-our Bayesian nonparametric multidimensional population model. We analyze data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and make high resolution, minimally modeled measurements of the pairwise distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, and spins. We find no evidence that the mass spectrum evolves over redshift and show that such measurements are fundamentally limited by the detector horizon. We find support for correlations of the spin distribution with binary mass ratio and redshift, but at reduced significance compared to overly constraining parametric models. Confident data-driven conclusions about population-level correlations with flexible models like PixelPop will require more informative gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>The non-thermal emission following GW170817 is consistent with a conical radially-stratified outflow with initial Lorentz factor $\lesssim10$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the non-thermal radio to X-ray emission following the neutron star merger GW170817 is consistent with synchrotron emission from a collisionless shock driven into the interstellar medium (ISM) by a conical radially stratified outflow observed $\approx0.25$~rad off-axis, with a power-low mass dependence on momentum, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-4}$, maximum Lorenz factor $\gamma=10$, opening (half-)angle $\approx0.15$~rad, and total energy of $\approx5\times10^{50}$erg. The temporal dependence of the flux during its rising phase is determined by the radial stratification structure, which determines the rate at which outflow energy is deposited in the ISM. This is in contrast with highly relativistic, $\gamma\approx100$, structured jet models, where the angular jet structure determines the time dependence through the gradual "unveiling" by deceleration of larger angular sections of the jet (which are initially "hidden" by relativistic beaming), typically leading to a predicted flux decline after the peak that is faster than observed. Our model predicts a dependence on the observing angle, which is different than that predicted by highly relativistic jet models. Particularly, similar merger events observed closer to the symmetry axis are predicted to show a similarly extended duration of flux increase with time. Our analysis demonstrates that the data do not require a highly relativistic $\gamma\approx100$ component, but the presence of such a component with opening angle $\ll0.15$~rad and energy $\ll5\times10^{50}$~erg cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>r-Process Nucleosynthesis and Radioactively Powered Transients from Magnetar Giant Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present nucleosynthesis and light-curve predictions for a new site of the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) from magnetar giant flares (GFs). Motivated by observations indicating baryon ejecta from GFs, Cehula et al. (2024) proposed mass ejection occurs after a shock is driven into the magnetar crust during the GF. We confirm using nuclear reaction network calculations that these ejecta synthesize moderate yields of third-peak $r$-process nuclei and more substantial yields of lighter $r$-nuclei, while leaving a sizable abundance of free neutrons in the outermost fastest expanding ejecta layers. The final $r$-process mass fraction and distribution are sensitive to the relative efficiencies of $\alpha$-capture and $n$-capture freeze-outs. We use our nucleosynthesis output in a semi-analytic model to predict the light curves of novae breves, the transients following GFs powered by radioactive decay. For a baryonic ejecta mass similar to that inferred of the 2004 Galactic GF from SGR 1806-20, we predict a peak UV/optical luminosity of $\sim 10^{39}$-$10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at $\sim 10$-$15$ minutes, rendering such events potentially detectable following a gamma-ray trigger by wide-field transient monitors such as ULTRASAT/UVEX to several Mpc. The peak luminosity and timescale of the transient increase with the GF strength due to the larger ejecta mass. Although GFs likely contribute 1-10% of the total Galactic $r$-process budget, their short delay-times relative to star-formation make them an attractive source to enrich the earliest generations of stars.</description>

      <title>A new long gamma-ray burst formation pathway at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are generally observed in low-metallicity environments. However, 10 to 20 per cent of LGRBs at redshift $z&lt;2$ are associated with near-solar to super-solar metallicity environments, remaining unexplained by traditional LGRB formation pathways that favour low metallicity progenitors.
  Aims. In this work, we propose a novel formation channel for LGRBs that is dominant at high metallicities. We explore how a stripped primary star in a binary can be spun up by a second, stable reverse-mass-transfer phase, initiated by the companion star.
  Methods. We use POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star mode grids, to investigate the metallicity dependence of the stable reverse-mass-transfer LGRB formation channel. We determine the available energy to power an LGRB from the rotational profile and internal structure of a collapsing star, and investigate how the predicted rate density of the proposed channel changes with different star formation histories and criteria for defining a successful LGRB.
  Results. Stable reverse mass transfer can produce rapidly rotating, stripped stars at collapse. These stars retain enough angular momentum to account for approximately 10-20% of the observed local LGRB rate density, under a reasonable assumption for the definition of a successful LGRB. However, the local rate density of LGRBs from stable reverse mass transfer can vary significantly, between 1 and 100 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, due to strong dependencies on cosmic star formation rate and metallicity evolution, as well as the assumed criteria for successful LGRBs.</description>

      <title>Effects of polar structure and moving ejecta on the dynamics of SGRB jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At least some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) originate from neutron star mergers, systems that release both a relativistic collimated jet and slower, wider ejecta. These jets evolve through a dense, anisotropic, and expanding medium produced during the merger process, resulting in interactions that affect their morphology and observable signatures. We investigate the propagation of SGRB jets through funnel-like structures that can be static or expanding with mildly relativistic speed using 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Our initial conditions are inspired from radial and angular distributions of density and pressure from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. We explore different values of the funnel opening angle and density contrast. We find that the polar structure of the ejecta mainly affects the jet evolution in the early stages, whereas the effect of expanding ejecta dominates in later stages. Jets propagating through a low-density polar funnel move initially faster, while the presence of mildly relativistic ejecta maintains the outflow more collimated after the breakout. Despite differences in the external medium, the energy dissipation within the jet and cocoon remains similar across models, while the shocked ambient material shows distinct signatures that could be observationally distinguishable. Our results highlight the importance of the structure and dynamical properties of the ejecta in shaping SGRB jets.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the structure of the stratified ultra-fast outflows in PDS 456 with XRISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple clumpy wind components ($v_{out}\sim0.2-0.3c$) in the luminous quasar PDS 456 have recently been resolved by XRISM in the Fe-K band for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the structure of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) using coordinated observations from XRISM, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, along with the self-consistently calculated photoionization model \texttt{PION}. Our results reveal a stratified ionization structure, characterized by a relation between wind velocity and ionization parameter $v_{out}\propto\xi^{(0.14\pm0.04)}$. To evaluate the impact of the screening effect, we tested all possible order permutations of six \texttt{PION} components. We find that highly ionized UFOs ($\log\xi&gt;4.5$) are insensitive to their relative positions, whereas the soft X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim3$ and $v_{out}\sim0.27c$) and the lowest-ionized hard X-ray UFO ($\log\xi\sim4.1$ and $v_ {out}\sim0.23c$) are statistically favored -- based on the evidence from both the C-statistic and Bayesian analysis -- to occupy the middle and innermost layers, respectively. This suggests a possible trend where slower UFOs are launched from regions closer to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The soft X-ray UFO is found to be thermally unstable, regardless of its relative position. However, its location remains unclear. Our sequence analysis and its similarity to hard X-ray UFOs suggest that they may be co-spatial, while variability constraints support its location within the broad-line region at sub-parsec scales. Simulations with the gate-valve opened XRISM show that high-resolution soft X-ray data can enhance the reliability of our results. Furthermore, simulations with the future X-ray mission NewAthena demonstrate its capability to resolve the absorber sequence and spatial distributions, enabling the determination of UFO structures and their roles in AGN feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM) is a numerical-relativity technique that solves Einstein's equations on an effectively infinite computational domain, thereby eliminating systematic errors associated with artificial boundary conditions. Whether CCM can robustly handle fully nonlinear, dynamical spacetimes, such as binary black hole (BBH) mergers, has remained an open question. In this work, we provide a positive answer by presenting nine successful CCM simulations of BBHs; and demonstrate a key application of this method: computing late-time tails. Our results pave the path for systematic studies of late-time tails in BBH systems, and for producing highly accurate waveforms essential to next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Modeling YSO Jets in 3D I: Highly Variable Asymmetric Magnetic Pressure-Driven Jets in the Polar Cavity from Toroidal Fields Generated by Inner Disk Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active turbulent disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism in the star formation context: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle.</description>

      <title>The landscape of binary core-collapse supernova progenitors and the late emergence of Wolf-Rayet winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using thousands of detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

      <title>Common envelopes in massive stars III. The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty to our understanding of how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case without accounting for recombination energy release. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles with multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be copiously produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers through nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung if the ALP-nucleon couplings $g_{a N}$ are sizable. The ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ may trigger conversions of ultralight ALPs into photons in the magnetic fields of the merger remnant and of the Milky Way. This effect would lead to a potentially observable short gamma-ray signal, in coincidence with the gravitational-wave signal produced during the merging process. This event could be detected through multi-messenger observation of BNS mergers employing the synergy between gravitational-wave detectors and gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we study the sensitivity of current and proposed MeV gamma-ray experiments to detect such a signal. As an explicit example, we consider ALP couplings related as in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) axion model, and show that in this case the proposed instruments can reach a sensitivity down to $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim \textrm{few} \times 10^{-13}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV, comparable with the SN 1987A limit.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of modified gravity scenarios by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high signal to noise ratio (SNR) with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Time domain astrophysics with transient sources. Delay estimate via Cross Correlation Function techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing analysis of transient events allows for investigating numerous still open areas of modern astrophysics. The article explores all the mathematical and physical tools required to estimate delays and associated errors between two Times of Arrival (ToA) lists, by exploiting Cross Correlation Function (CCF) techniques. The CCF permits the establishment of the delay between two observed signals and is defined on two continuous functions. A detector does not directly measure the intensity of the electromagnetic signal (interacting with its material) but rather detects each photon ToA through a probabilistic process. Since the CCF is defined on continuous functions, the crucial step is to obtain a continuous rate curve from a list of ToA. This step is treated in the article and the constructed rate functions are light curves that are continuous functions. This allows, in principle, the estimation of delays with any desired resolution. Due to the statistical nature of the measurement process, two independent detections of the same signal yield different photon times. Consequently, light curves derived from these lists differ due to Poisson fluctuations, leading the CCF between them to fluctuate around the true theoretical delay. This article describes a Monte Carlo technique that enables reliable delay estimation by providing a robust measure of the uncertainties induced by Poissonian fluctuations. GRB data are considered as they offer optimal test cases for the proposed techniques. The developed techniques provides a significant computational advantage and are useful analyzing of data characterized by low-count statistics (i.e., low photon count rates in c/s), as they allow overcoming the limitations associated with traditional fixed bin-size methods.</description>
