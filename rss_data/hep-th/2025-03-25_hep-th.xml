      <title>Chiral Vortical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the collective modes of chiral matter described by the second-order chiral hydrodynamics, noticing that chiral shear waves (CSWs) may become unstable for momenta above a characteristic scale. In the absence of sufficient dissipation, this instability emerges within the hydrodynamic regime, depending on the interplay between shear viscosity and the anomalous vortical contribution to the stress-energy tensor at second order in hydrodynamic expansion. We show that this instability generates helical flows and name it the {\it chiral vortical instability} (CVI). Alongside the chiral plasma and magnetovortical instabilities, CVI tends to transfer initial microscopic chirality into macroscopic helicities, which combine into a generalized axial charge. We further find that an elementary static Gromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific momentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral hydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution. This observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological implications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</description>

      <title>Thermal effective actions from conformal boundary conditions in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has studied the thermodynamics of gravity subjected to conformal boundary conditions, where the trace of the extrinsic curvature $K$ and the conformal class of metrics are kept fixed. The case $K &lt; 0$ seems tied to solutions with cosmic horizons. To study this situation further, we analyze Einstein-Maxwell theory, where we find solutions with cosmic horizons corresponding to patches inside the inner horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We find that these solutions are $\it{necessary}$ for consistency with the thermal effective action in the putative boundary dual at $O(1)$ chemical potential. Furthermore, we introduce a (positive or negative) cosmological constant and find more cases where solutions with cosmic horizons dominate the ensemble. Transitions between solutions with cosmic horizons and solutions with black hole horizons are mediated by "extremal" solutions that correspond to patches of (A)dS$_2 \times \Sigma^{d-1}$, for which we discuss an effective JT gravity description with dimensionally reduced conformal boundary conditions. Finally, we introduce rotation in some simple cases and find that the bulk theory reproduces the universal velocity-dependent modification of the free energy predicted by the thermal effective action.</description>

      <title>Gradient structures from extensions of over-extended Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-extended Kac-Moody algebras contain so-called gradient structures - a gl(d)-covariant level decomposition of the algebra contains strings of modules at different levels that can be interpreted as spatial gradients. We present an algebraic origin for this phenomenon, based on the recently introduced Lie algebra extension of an over-extended Kac-Moody algebra by its fundamental module, appearing in tensor hierarchy algebra super-extensions of over-extended Kac-Moody algebras. The extensions are described in terms of Lie algebra cohomology, vanishing for finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, but non-vanishing in relevant infinite-dimensional cases. The extension is described in a few different gradings, where it is given a covariant description with respect to different subalgebras. We expect the results to be important for the connection between extended geometry and cosmological billiards.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy and islands in a braneworld cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the nature of mixed state entanglement and correlation in a braneworld cosmological model, where the bulk geometry is described by an eternal BTZ black hole truncated by an end-of-the-world brane representing a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology. We explore the holographic reflected entropy for both adjacent and disjoint subsystems using the island prescription and the defect extremal surface prescription. In the large central charge limit, we demonstrate that both prescriptions yield an exact agreement. Additionally, we analyze the time evolution of reflected entropy and holographic mutual information, along with an analysis of the geometric Markov gap. Our study provides new insights into the role of quantum extremal surfaces in probing black hole interiors and cosmological spacetimes, with implications for understanding mixed state entanglement and quantum information dynamics in holographic cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Gauge preservation in renormalization for Yang-Mills and gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Regular Black Holes and Complete Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the conjecture for the complete monotonicity of certain curvature invariants for quantum black holes. In this note, we study a class of quantum regular black holes that are static, spherically symmetric, and characterized only by their mass. Additionally, this class of black holes reduces to the Schwarzschild solution in the classical limit $\hbar\to 0$. We provide evidence supporting the non-perturbativity conjecture that perturbative corrections cannot falsify complete monotonicity. We demonstrate that these quantum black holes cannot be generated by perturbative quantum corrections to the Einstein equations. We then investigate the thermodynamics of these black holes and derive a bound on their entropy, showing that the entropy is always greater than the horizon area divided by 4G. We Also demonstrate that these black holes exhibit a bounded temperature, with a maximum temperature scaling as $T\sim\frac{1}{L_p}$ and a critical mass scale where the temperature vanishes</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion induced by fluctuating boundaries and compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum Brownian motion of a point charge arising as a consequence of two fluctuating point-like boundaries. The study considers Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions imposed on a real massless scalar field. Additionally, we analyze the effects of a fluctuating compactification length on the random motion of the point charge, induced by the imposition of a quasi-periodic condition on the scalar field. By associating a wave function with the length scale of each system, we demonstrate that typical divergences, which commonly appear in scenarios with fixed boundaries and compactification size, are effectively smoothed out. This approach generalizes and extends previous results found in the literature, offering new insights into the regularization of divergences appearing in idealized systems.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a path integral representation of the time evolution $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)$ for Lagrangians of the variable $A$ which can be represented in the form (quadratic in $Q$) ${\cal L}(A)=Q(A){\cal M}Q(A)+\partial_{\mu}L^{\mu}$. We show that $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0}) =\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ up to an $A$-independent factor. We discuss examples of the states $\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory (analogs of the Kodama states in quantum gravity). We show the relevance of these states for a determination of the dynamics in terms of stochastic differential equations. We discuss applications to gauge theory on a Lorentzian manifold and gauge theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy and its linear response following a global quench in holographic Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth of entanglement entropy in time-dependent states formed due to a global quench in holographic conformal field theories which admit an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet dual gravity description is studied. The global quench in the bulk is modelled by an AdS Vaidya solution with an electric charge. It is observed that the Gauss-Bonnet correction parameter leads to faster thermalization, and lower saturation entropy. The rate of growth also depends crucially on the correction, and may exceed 1 in general spacetime dimensions. Nevertheless, the growth still follows the universal pattern expected for relativistic CFTs. Additionally, a time-dependent analogue of relative entropy introduced in [12] is generalized to include correction from the Gauss-Bonnet parameter. We demonstrate our findings through concrete examples, including instantaneous, linear, and periodically driven quenches.</description>

      <title>On the Topological Nature of the Butterfly Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, also known as dynamical chaos, is a strongly nonlinear qualitative phenomenon. Its most promising theoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches, with symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such symmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS). STS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the order associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding topological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The Faddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the dynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the infinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective field theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE in the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate that one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the external $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of STS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the Goldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and the operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the experimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law correlations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field possesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly, when the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation, the holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the associated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Restoration of residual gauge symmetries due to topological defects and color confinement in the Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RGS is the local gauge symmetry remaining even after imposing the gauge fixing condition. Although this symmetry is ``spontaneously broken'' in the perturbative vacuum, it can be restored in the true confining vacuum of QCD. Therefore, a color confinement criterion is obtained as the condition of restoration of the RGS, namely, disappearance of the massless Nambu-Goldstone pole associated with this spontaneous breaking, provided that the color confinement phase is a disordered phase where all internal symmetries remain unbroken. In the Lorenz gauge, indeed, it was shown by Hata that the restoration condition is identical to the Kugo-Ojima color confinement criterion, if the gauge transformation function $\omega (x)$ for the residual gauge symmetry is taken to be linear in $x$. However, this result was obtained without regard to topological configurations. In this talk, we reconsider this issue by taking into account topological defects that are expected to play the dominant role for realizing confinement in the non-perturbative way.</description>

      <title>Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply an ADM deparametrization strategy to radial canonical $\Lambda &lt; 0$ gravity in three dimensions. It gives rise to a concise notation for previous holographic interpretations in terms of an identified radial 'volume time' and 'true' ADM degrees of freedom. We further discuss York time and conformal boundary conditions in this context, and construct a BTZ wavepacket solution to the radial WdW equation.</description>

      <title>The structure of divergences in the higher-derivative supersymmetric $6D$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we perform a comprehensive study of the structure of divergences in the higher-derivative $6D$ ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory coupled to the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation. The effective action is constructed in the framework of the superfield background field method with the help of ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher-derivative regularization scheme which preserves all symmetries of the theory. The one-loop divergences are calculated in a manifestly gauge invariant and $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric form hopefully admitting a generalization to higher loops. The $\beta$-function in the one-loop approximation is found and analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the one-loop $\beta$-function for an arbitrary regulator function is specified by integrals of double total derivatives in momentum space, like it happens in $4D,\, {\cal N}=1$ superfield gauge theories. This points to the potential possibility to derive the all-loop NSVZ-like exact $\beta$-function in the considered theory.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative formulation of resonances in quantum mechanics based on exact WKB method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact WKB analysis as a non-perturbative framework. While previous works focus mainly on stable systems, we explore quasi-stable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to non-polynomial potentials.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions for non-conformal D$p$-brane holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use holography to study correlation functions of local operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories arising on the world-volume of D$p$-branes in the large-$N$ and strong-coupling limit. The relevant supergravity backgrounds obtained from the near-horizon limit of the D$p$-branes enjoy a scaling similarity, which leads to an auxiliary AdS space of fractional dimension. This suggests that holographic correlation functions in this setup can be computed by integrating standard CFT correlators over the auxiliary extra dimensions. We apply this prescription to analytically compute two- and three-point correlators of scalar operators. The resulting two-point functions take a familiar CFT form but with shifted conformal dimensions, while the three-point correlators have a much more involved position dependence which we calculate explicitly in terms of a sum of Appell functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of three-dimensional Carroll gravity with negative cosmological constant is studied. We formulate a consistent set of boundary conditions preserved by an infinite-dimensional extension of the AdS$_3$ Carroll algebra, which turns out to be isomorphic to a precise generalized BMS$_3$ algebra. This is described by four independent functions of the circle at infinity, generating spatial superrotations, Carroll superboosts, spatial supertranslations and time supertranslations. Remarkably, this asymptotic symmetry algebra contains as subalgebras to BMS$_3$ (generated by spatial superrotations and time supertranslations) and the two-dimensional conformal algebra (spanned by spatial superrotations and spatial supertranslations). We also introduce a new solution - endowed with a Carroll extremal surface - that fulfills this set of asymptotic conditions. By taking advantage of the Chern-Simons formulation of the theory, Carroll thermal properties, obtained from regularity conditions, and entropy of the configuration are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the entanglement entropy equipped with the $\kappa$-algebra. This entanglement entropy is computed through the geometric setup as performed by Hartman-Maldacena, which, in their prescription, finds that the entropy grows linearly in time. In our case, we show that the $\kappa$-algebra embedding provides a richer scenario where the third-order corrections in time added from $\kappa$-algebra to entanglement entropy imply that the growth of quantum correlations between subsystems is more intricate than a simple linear increase into the dynamics of black hole thermalization and quantum information flow. In the context of holography, such corrections suggest that the thermalization process is not instantaneous but involves higher-order interactions between subsystems.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents the solution to a counting problem, to the best of our knowledge not known in full generality, which can be mapped to both (i) ways to lace a $N$-holes-per-side shoe with $\ell$ shoestrings and (ii) a sum over the indexes of $2N$-tensors made of symmetric 2-tensors. The coefficients that answer this question are then connected to spin $J=N$ boson exchange amplitudes and perturbative unitarity constraints, deriving relations with Legendre polynomials and sum rules.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetically Charged Black Holes with Phantom Global Monopoles: Thermodynamics, Geodesics, Gravitational Lensing, Quasinormal Modes, and Grey-Body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles, focusing on its impact on gravitational lensing and black hole shadows. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NED, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>Indication of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation within the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near (~100 pc) and far (~8.7 kpc) relative to the Galactic center, the molecular clouds SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL exhibit different values of the fundamental physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Measured frequency difference between the emission lines of methanol (CH3OH), - J_K_u - J_K_l = 6_3 - 5_2 A+ 542000.981 MHz, 6_3 - 5_2 A- 542081.936 MHz, and 8_0 - 7_-1 E 543076.194 MHz, - observed with the space observatory Herschel toward SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL corresponds to (Sgr-Ori): Delta mu/mu = (-3.7 +/- 0.5)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.). At the same time, comparison of the same methanol lines in Orion-KL with laboratory frequencies shows no significant changes in mu (Ori-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-0.5 +/- 0. 6)*10^(-7), while a comparison between SgrB2(N) and laboratory lines indicates a lower value of mu near the Galactic center (Sgr-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7). The reduced value of mu in SgrB2(N) is not explained by known systematic effects and requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Probing of Lorentz-Violating Dispersion Relations via Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity frameworks predicting Planck-scale deviations from Lorentz invariance, we probe Lorentz symmetry violation via modified dispersion relations $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$. Departing from conventional approaches, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector to probe energy-dependent modifications to the dispersion relations. Two key methodological advances are introduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without assuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection paradigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$ through localized momentum-shell integration. By restricting detector-field interactions to narrow spectral windows and performing iterative Taylor expansions around reference momenta $|\textbf{k}_0|$, we derive coefficients encoding derivatives of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$, reconstructing its global profile via momentum-space tomography. The analysis reveals how deviations from linear dispersion relations disrupt the thermal character of the Unruh effect, while perturbative modifications preserve thermality at low energies. This approach offers a scalable method to test Lorentz symmetry violation across energy scales, and establishes a foundation for experimental verification of Planck-scale relics through high-precision spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity in Hayward spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new black hole solution, namely, a Hayward-like metric incorporating corrections due to non-commutativity. We begin by deriving this solution using the non-commutative gauge theory framework. The general properties of the metric are then analyzed, including the event horizon structure and the Kretschmann scalar. Analogous to the standard Hayward solution, the modified black hole remains regular, provided that additional conditions must be satisfied, specifically $\theta \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi \;\middle|\; n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$. Next, we examine the thermodynamic properties, computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. The temperature profile suggests the existence of a remnant mass when $T^{(\Theta,l)} \to 0$. Quantum radiation is analyzed by considering both bosonic and fermionic particle modes, with an estimation of the particle creation density provided for each case. The effective potential is evaluated perturbatively to accomplish the analysis of quasinormal modes and the time-domain response for scalar perturbations. The study of null geodesics is explored to enable the characterization of the photon sphere and black hole shadows. Additionally, constraints on the shadows are estimated based on EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) data. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature is determined to assess the stability of critical orbits, followed by an analysis of gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Finally, the constraints (bounds) on the parameters $\Theta$ (non-commutativity) and $l$ (``Hayward parameter'') are derived based on solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay effect.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inflationary phenomenology of a rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In this framework, the gravitational constant of the Einstein-Hilbert term is rescaled due to effective terms active in the high curvature era. Basically, the total theory is an $F(R,G,\phi)$ theory with the Gauss-Bonnet part contributing only a non-minimal coupling to the scalar field, so it is a theory with string theory origins and with a non-trivial $F(R)$ gravity part. The $F(R)$ gravity part in the high curvature regime contributes only a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term and thus the resulting theory is effectively a rescaled version of a standard Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We develop the formalism of rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, taking in account the GW170817 constraints on the gravitational wave speed. We show explicitly how the rescaled theory affects directly the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations, and how the slow-roll and observational indices of inflation are affected by the rescaling of the theory. We perform a thorough phenomenological analysis of several models of interest and we show that is it possible to obtain viable inflationary theories compatible with the latest Planck data. Also among the studied models there are cases that yield a relatively large blue tilted tensor spectral index and we demonstrate that these models can lead to detectable primordial gravitational waves in the future gravitational wave experiments. Some of the scenarios examined, for specific values of the reheating temperature may be detectable by SKA, LISA, BBO, DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for studying generalized Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models in which we use a dimensionless form of the area-entropy of cosmological horizons. The future event horizon is applied though the formalism can also be applied to any other type of the horizon, too. Then, we use our formalism for nonextensive horizon entropies of standard HDE (i.e. Bekenstein-Hawking), and generalized such as Barrow/Tsallis-Cirto, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis as dark energy models of the universe and test them by cosmological data.
  We find the bounds on the specific entropy model parameters and also apply statistical comparison tool such as the Bayesian evidence criterion in order to favour or disfavour the models against standard $\Lambda$CDM.
  The main data test results are that all the HDE models under study are statistically disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, though at some different levels. The standard HDE seem to be on the same footing as R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis HDE models since the latter include only small deviations from HDE model resulting from the series expansion of their extra nonextensivity parameters. However, Barrow and Tsallis-Cirto models, though still disfavoured against $\Lambda$CDM, seem to point out observationally to fulfil an important physical property of extensivity (though still remaining nonadditive) which is in agreement with our previous results of Refs. \cite{Dabrowski:2020atl,PhysRevD.108.103533} and recent claims of Ref. \cite{TSALLIS2025139238}. Finally, the Tsallis-Cirto model parameter is pointing towards the $\Lambda$CDM limit which is singular also at the expense of having much larger value of the holographic dark energy dimensionless parameter $k$ value higher than other models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and shadow radius analysis of the charged Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic and shadow radius analysis of an electrically charged black hole (EC) with electric charge $q$ and coupling constant $\mu$ obtained from the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electodynamics. For $\mu=0.03$, we have four solution branches of the horizon including low, hot, negative, and cold ones, while for $\mu=0.3,3$ there exist single branches without limitation on $q$. The shadow radius for the low branch is the nearly same as that for the Reissner-Norstr\"om black hole for $q&lt;1$ case, while one finds the $q&gt;1$ negative branch which is constrained by the EHT observation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles and Exotic States in $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ (4-2-2, for short), the observed quarks and leptons of each family reside in the bi-fundamental representations $(4,2,1)$ and $({\bar 4},1,2)$. There exist, however, the fundamental representations $(4,1,1)$, $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ and their hermitian conjugates, which show the presence, in principle, of yet to be discovered color triplets that carry electric charge $\pm{e/6}$, and color singlet particles with charges of $\pm{e/2}$. These Standard Model charges are in full accord with the fact that the 4-2-2 model predicts the presence of a topologically stable finite energy magnetic monopole that carries two quanta of Dirac magnetic charge, i.e., $4 \pi/e$, as well as color magnetic charge that is screened beyond the quark confinement scale. The 4-2-2 model therefore predicts the existence of exotic baryons, mesons and leptons that carry fractional ($\pm{e/2}$) electric charges. Since their origin lies in the fundamental representations of 4-2-2, these exotic particles may turn out to be relatively light, in the TeV mass range or so. The 4-2-2 magnetic monopole mass depends on the 4-2-2 symmetry breaking scale which may be as low as a few TeV.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Quark Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is investigated in the deconfined region of the QCD phase diagram (as a model for Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) emerging in Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC)), using the Kubo formula to calculate a linear response to the chiral imbalance, and the Field Correlator Method to address the strong interaction in QCD. The estimate suggests that CME is severely suppressed in most of the QCD phase diagram, except within a narrow strip at baryon densities above nuclear and temperatures just above the deconfinement transition. The result suggests refining the conditions under which the CME might be observable -- prioritizing the conditions at lower energy RHIC-BES, SPS and upcoming FAIR, NICA, J-PARC-HI, which supposedly produce high baryon density QGP, over the higher energy RHIC and LHC, which produce high temperature QGP.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei: corrections from neutron-neutron effective range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an effective field-theoretical approach, we investigate the properties of weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei (also known as Borromean nuclei) that do not support a low-energy $s$-wave core-neutron resonance. Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.</description>

      <title>First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of finite spin quark density on the chiral and deconfinement thermal transitions using numerical simulations of lattice QCD with two dynamical light quarks. The finite spin density is introduced by the quark spin potential in the canonical formulation of the spin operator. We show that both chiral and deconfinement temperatures are decreasing functions of the spin potential. We determine the parabolic curvatures of transition temperatures in a limit of physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

Abstract: In the $SO(2,d)$ gauge theory formalism of AdS gravity established in arXiv:1811.05286, the dynamics of bulk gravity emerges from the vanishing of the boundary covariant anomaly for the $SO(2,d)$ conservation law. In parallel with the known results on chiral anomalies, we establish the descendent structure of the holographic $SO(2,d)$ anomaly. The corresponding anomaly characteristic class, bulk Chern-Simons like action as well as the boundary effective action are constructed systematically. The anomalous conservation law is presented both in the covariant and consistent formalisms. Due to the existence of the ruler field, not only the Bardeen-Zumino polynomial, but also the covariant and consistent currents are explicitly constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the tree-level partition function of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the end of the world branes (ETW branes) for arbitrary tension and the one-loop partition function of Euclidean thermal $AdS_{3}$ in the presence of a tensionless ETW brane with the Neumann boundary condition. At the tree level, our results match with the previous ones in non-rotating cases, but at the one-loop level, our results contain unexpected terms, which contain the fluctuations of the ghost fields. However particularly in the case where the chemical potential is zero, we get a similar form as the original result in AdS/CFT case, but the exponent is slightly changed. In this case the ghost contribution looks going away and the partition function becomes physical in a sense that the coefficients of the expansion in powers of $q$ are positive, which means that the number of states at the level is always positive.</description>

Abstract: We propose an extension of the formalism developed by Stelle-West and Grignani-Nardelli to the case of FDAs. We first consider the case of FDAs carrying one $p$-form extension and no non-trivial cohomology. We show that it is possible to define large gauge transformations as a direct extension of the large transformations induced by their Lie subalgebras and study the resulting non-linear realizations. Furthermore, we extend the results to the case FDAs with non-trivial cohomology by introducing large gauge transformations that carry the information about the FDA cocycle structure constants. We consider two examples of this type of gauge algebra, namely, FDA extensions of the bosonic Poincar\'{e} and Maxwell algebras, write down their dual $L_{\infty}$ algebras and study their non-linear realizations and possible invariant action principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>

Abstract: We construct new families of supersymmetric AdS$_2\times\mathbb{M}_4$ solutions of $D=6$ gauged supergravity and AdS$_3\times\mathbb{M}_4$ solutions of $D=7$ gauged supergravity, where $\mathbb{M}_4$ are four-dimensional toric orbifolds with four fixed points. These are presented in a unified fashion, that highlights their common underlying geometry. The $D=6$ solutions uplift to massive type IIA and describe the near-horizon limit of D4-branes wrapped on $\mathbb{M}_4$, while the $D=7$ solutions uplift to $D=11$ supergravity and describe the near-horizon limit of M5-branes wrapped on $\mathbb{M}_4$. We reproduce the entropy and gravitational central charge of the two families by extremizing a function constructed gluing the orbifold gravitational blocks proposed in arXiv:2210.16128.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections in Maxwell-metric-affine bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the coupling of the metric-affine bumblebee gravity to the Abelian gauge field and obtain the effective model corresponding to the weak gravity limit of this theory. The effective bumblebee theory displays new unconventional couplings between the bumblebee field and its field strength, and the $U(1)$ gauge field along with its respective field strength, as a result of the non-metricity effects. Thus, being a new gauge-bumblebee theory, it represents an example of vector-vector couplings which are very rarely considered, if not entirely overlooked, in the Abelian case. For this theory we calculate the lower perturbative corrections. We close the paper with discussions of other possible vector-vector couplings.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems, in particular its critical dynamics near phase transitions, have been always on the cutting edge of studies in diverse fields of physics, e.g., high energy physics, condensed matter, holography, etc. In this work, we investigate the critical damping of collective modes associated with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, which are called pseudo-Goldstone modes, in strongly correlated systems. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory, we find a universal pseudo-Goldstone damping via the critical O($N$) model that has never been found before by other approaches. Different from the conventional damping found in holography and hydrodynamics, the new one is controlled by critical fluctuations, hence is invisible in mean-field systems or strongly correlated systems with classical gravity duals. Since the critical damping depends solely on the universalities of the critical point, irrespective of the microscopic details, our conclusion should be applicable to a wide class of interacting systems.</description>

      <title>How to define the moving frame of the Unruh-DeWitt detector on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB, to find factor 2 discrepancy from the standard result. Differential geometry is constructed in such a way that local calculations can be performed rigorously. If one expects Markov property, the calculation is expected to be local. The final piece that was missing was a local non-perturbative calculation, which is now complemented by the exact WKB. Our analysis defines a serious problem regarding the relationship between entanglement of the Unruh effect and differential geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ an ADM deparametrization strategy to discuss the radial canonical formalism of asymptotically AdS$_3$ gravity. It leads to the identification of a radial 'time' before quantization, which is the volume time, canonically conjugate to York time. Holographically, this allows to interpret the semi-classical path integral of $T\bar T$ theory as a Schr\"odinger wavefunctional satisfying a Schr\"odinger evolution equation in volume time, and the $T\bar T$ operator expectation value in terms of the Hamiltonian that generates volume time translations -- both consistent with cut-off holography. We make use of the canonical perspective to construct the rotating BTZ solution from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, with a finite cut-off energy spectrum that has a known holographic $T\bar T$ interpretation, as well as semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt states for that solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we revisit the entanglement wedge representation of AdS$_3$ bulk fields in terms of CFT operator product expansion (OPE) blocks for a general class of blocks. Given a boundary interval and its associated causal diamond, the OPEs involve boundary operators with or without spin, and located either at spacelike or timelike edges of the diamond. Only for a subset of these cases, can the OPE block be dual to a geodesic bulk field. We show that when applied to de Sitter, a suitable combination of Euclidean OPE blocks can represent a dS scalar integrated over the timelike extremal surfaces, which play an important role in defining pseudo-entropy. We also work out some simple higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes using the velocity correlation function. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the velocity correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. We also find that the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for masssuperposed BTZ black holes. This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation, even in quantum-superposed spacetime.</description>

      <title>Integrability of the $\lambda$-deformation of the PCM with spectators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a generalisation of the $\lambda$-deformation of the Principal Chiral Model (PCM) where we deform just a subgroup $F$ of the full symmetry group $G$. We find that demanding Lax integrability imposes a crucial restriction, namely that the coset $F\backslash G$ must be symmetric. Surprisingly, we also find that (when $F$ is non-abelian) integrability requires that the term in the action involving only the spectator fields should have a specific $\lambda$-dependence, which is a curious modification of the procedure expected from the known $F=G$ case. The resulting Lax connection has a novel analytical structure, with four single poles as opposed to the two poles of the cases of the PCM and of the standard $\lambda$-deformation. We also explicitly work out the example of $G=SU(2)$ and $F=U(1)$, discussing its renormalisation group flow to two loops.</description>

Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Dual Dressed Black Holes as the end point of the Charged Superradiant instability in ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged Black holes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ suffer from superradiant instabilities over a range of energies. Hairy black hole solutions (constructed within gauged supergravity) have previously been proposed as endpoints to this instability. We demonstrate that these hairy black holes are themselves unstable to the emission of large dual giant gravitons. We propose that the endpoint to this instability is given by Dual Dressed Black Holes (DDBH)s; configurations consisting of one, two, or three very large dual giant gravitons surrounding a core $AdS$ black hole with one, two, or three $SO(6)$ chemical potentials equal to unity. The dual giants each live at $AdS$ radial coordinates of order $\sqrt{N}$ and each carry charge of order $N^2$. The large separation makes DDBHs a very weakly interacting mix of their components and allows for a simple computation of their thermodynamics. We conjecture that DDBHs dominate the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills over a range of energies around the BPS plane, and provide an explicit construction of this phase diagram, briefly discussing the interplay with supersymmetry. We develop the quantum description of dual giants around black hole backgrounds and explicitly verify that DDBHs are stable to potential tunneling instabilities, precisely when the chemical potentials of the core black holes equal unity. We also construct the 10-dimensional DDBH bulk solutions.</description>

Abstract: We further develop the BPS/CFT correspondence between quiver W-algebras/$qq$-characters and partition functions of gauge origami. We introduce $qq$-characters associated with multi-dimensional partitions with nontrivial boundary conditions which we call Donaldson--Thomas (DT) $qq$-characters. They are operator versions of the equivariant DT vertices of toric Calabi--Yau three and four-folds. Moreover, we revisit the construction of the D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions and give a quantum algebraic derivation of the sign rules of the magnificent four partition function. We also show that under the proper sign rules, the D6 and D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions all commute with each other and discuss its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1+1 dimensions, the equations of motion of the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) effective string have a re-writing in terms of a first order system. This is attributed to FZZ duality. In this note, we observe that a similar re-writing exists in higher dimensions, so that the degree of the dilaton-winding subsystem reduces to first order. The 1+1 first order equations emerge as a natural limit of the higher dimensional HP system in the cap region of the cigar. As a result, there is a critical value of the winding amplitude that matches with the 1+1 coset SCFT prediction. At this critical point, the cigar has a puncture at the Euclidean horizon and the $higher$ $dimensional$ black hole entropy is correctly reproduced by the winding condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_4$ superspace and supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $N=1$ superspace, AdS$_4$ supersymmetry is realized as the non-linear super coordinate transformations. The fermionic coordinates form a faithful non-linear representation of supersymmetry on their own. By introducing an auxiliary scalar coordinate, this representation is reformulated as a 5-dimensional linear representation, i.e., the superspinor representation. New linear representations are constructed by tensor products of multiple superspinors. Especially, the superspace bosonic coordinates are embedded in the supervector representation, which is the traceless symmetric part of the bi-superspinor representation. Based on these linear representations, the $N=1$ AdS$_4$ supergravity action can be reproduced in a manifestly supersymmetry-covariant way.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric domain walls in modified $\phi^{4}$ theory: Excitation spectra, scattering, and decay of bions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant field model with a $\phi^{4}$ potential modified by a term that introduces asymmetries at the manifold space. In this framework, the model recovers its original symmetry only when $p=0$. The asymmetry introduced in the potential suggests that, even when one of the minima diverges asymptotically, kink/antikink-like configurations emerge in the theory, shifting the critical point of the energy density away from the center of the kink-like solutions. Hence, we note that the model supports asymmetrical kink/antikink-like topological solutions. Furthermore, an analysis of the excitation spectrum of these solutions revealed the absence of vibrational modes. Finally, we examine the dynamical solutions for different values of initial velocity by allowing us to verify the effects of asymmetries on the collision properties.</description>

      <title>Poisson electrodynamics on $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poisson electrodynamics is the semi-classical limit of $U(1)$ non-commutative gauge theory. It has been studied so far as a theoretical model, where an external field would be the source of the non-commutative effects in space-time. Being the Standard Model of fundamental interactions a local theory, the prediction of observables within it would be drastically altered by such effects. The natural question that arises is: how do particles interact with this field ? In this work, we will answer this question using point-like charged particles interacting with the Poisson gauge field, investigating how their trajectories are affected using the $\kappa$-Minkowski structure. The interaction arises from the construction of a gauge-invariant action. Using the field solutions, we find the second-order equation for the deformed Lorentz force, indicating possible effects of an emergent gravity due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Relating flat connections and polylogarithms on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</description>

      <title>A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. Along the way, we derive constraints on integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type.</description>

      <title>Renormalising the Field-Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic s+d model from the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the phase structure of a holographic s+d model with quartic potential terms from the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is studied in the probe limit. We first show the $q_d-\mu$ phase diagram with a very small value of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha=1\times10^{-7}$ and in absence of the quartic terms to locate the suitable choice of the value of $q_d$, where the system admits coexistent s+d solutions. Then we consider various values of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$ and present the $\alpha-\mu$ phase diagram to show the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the phase structure. We also give an example of the reentrant phase transition which is also realized in the holographic s+s and s+p models. After that we confirm the universality of the influence of the quartic term with coefficient $\lambda_d$ on the d-wave solutions, which is similar to the case of s-wave and p-wave solutions previously studied in the s+p model. Finally we give the dependence of the special values of the quartic term coefficient $\lambda_d$ on the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$, below which the d-wave condensate grows to an opposite direction at the (quasi-)critical point, which is useful in realizing 1st order phase transitions in further studies of the holographic d-wave superfluids.</description>

      <title>Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B&gt;B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B&lt;B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph satisfying an acyclic condition and demonstrate how the set of all acyclic decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>

      <title>On BRST Lagrangian formulation for massive higher-spin fields in $4D$ Minkowski space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of the BRST approach to the gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for free massive higher-spin bosonic fields focusing on two specific aspects. First, the theory is considered in four dimensional flat space in terms of spin-tensor fields with two component undotted and dotted indices. This leads to a significant simplification of the whole approach in comparison with the one where the fields with vector indices were used, since now there is no need to introduce a constraint responsible for the traces of the fields into the BRST charge. Second, we develop an extremely simple and clear procedure to eliminate all the auxiliary fields and prove that the BRST equations of motion identically reproduce the basic conditions for irreducible representations of the Poinc\'are group with a given mass and spin. Similar to the massless theory, the final Lagrangian for massive higher-spin fields is formulated in triplet form. The BRST formulation leads to a system of fields that are clearly subdivided into the basic spin $s$ field, Zinoviev-like auxiliary fields, Singh-Hagen-like auxiliary fields, and special BRST auxiliary fields. The auxiliary fields can be partially eliminated by gauge fixing and/or using the equations of motion. This allows one to obtain formally different (with different numbers of auxiliary fields) but equivalent Lagrangian formulations.</description>

      <title>The wavefunction of a quantum $S^1 \times S^2$ universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum gravity corrections to the no-boundary wavefunction describing a universe with spatial topology $S^1\times S^2$. It has been suggested that quantum effects become increasingly important when the size of the circle is large relative to the sphere. In this paper, we confirm this claim by an explicit four-dimensional one-loop calculation of the gravitational path integral preparing such a state. In the process, we clarify some aspects of the gravitational path integral on complex spacetimes. These quantum corrections play a crucial role in ensuring that the norm of the wavefunction is naturally expressed in terms of a path integral over $S^2 \times S^2$ at the classical level. We extend some of the analysis to more general spatial topologies, as well as to the inclusion of fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of T-duality to manifolds endowed with non-principal torus actions. The singularities of the torus action are controlled by a certain Lie algebroid, called the elliptic tangent bundle. Using this Lie algebroid, we explain how certain invariant generalized complex structures can be transported via T-duality. Along the way, we use the elliptic tangent bundle to define connections for these torus action, and give new insight to the classification of such actions by Haefliger-Salem.</description>

      <title>Rainbow gravity effects on quantum dynamics of scalar and oscillator fields in a topological defect cosmological space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum dynamics of scalar and oscillator fields in a topological defect space-time background under the influence of rainbow gravity's. The rainbow gravity's are introduced into the considered cosmological space-time geometry by replacing the temporal part $dt \to \frac{dt}{\mathcal{F}(\chi)}$ and the spatial part $dx^i \to \frac{dx^i}{\mathcal{H} (\chi)}$, where $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{H}$ are the rainbow functions and $\chi=E/E_p$. We derived the radial equation of the Klein-Gordon equation and its oscillator equation under rainbow gravity's in topological space-time. To obtain eigenvalue of the quantum systems under investigations, we set the rainbow functions $\mathcal{F}(\chi)=1$ and $\mathcal{H}(\chi)=\sqrt{1-\beta\,\chi^p}$, where $p=1,2$. We solve the radial equations through special functions using these rainbow functions and analyze the results. In fact, it is shown that the presence of cosmological constant, the topological defect parameter $\alpha$, and the rainbow parameter $\beta$ modified the energy spectrum of scalar and oscillator fields in comparison to the results obtained in flat space.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology from a type-II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have successfully integrated $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a promising model for alleviating cosmological tensions, into a theoretical framework by endowing it with a specific Lagrangian from the VCDM model, a type-II minimally modified gravity. In this theory, we demonstrate that an auxiliary scalar field with a linear potential induces an effective cosmological constant, enabling the realization of an abrupt mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe through a piecewise linear potential. To eliminate the sudden singularity in this setup and ensure stable transitions, we smooth out this potential. Realized within the VCDM theory, the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model facilitates two types of rapid smooth mirror AdS-dS transitions: (i) the agitated transition, associated with a smooth jump in the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, and consequently $H$, exhibits a bump around the transition's midpoint; and (ii) the quiescent transition, associated with a smooth change in the slope of the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ transitions gracefully. These transitions are likely to leave distinct imprints on the background and perturbation dynamics, potentially allowing the observational data to distinguish between them. This novel theoretical framework propels $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM into a fully predictive model capable of exploring the evolution of the Universe including the late-time AdS-dS transition epoch, and extends the applicability of the model. We believe further research is crucial in establishing $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM as a leading candidate or guide for a new concordance cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tunneling phenomenon of a charged Dirac particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole. It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole. The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying generalized K\"ahler geometry, which separates its holomorphic moduli from its compatible Riemannian metric in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds. We discover that the holomorphic structure underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold is a holomorphic symplectic Morita double bimodule between double symplectic groupoids, and that each compatible Riemannian metric is given by a Lagrangian submanifold forming a bisection of the real symplectic core of this double bimodule. In other words, a generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the generalized K\"ahler metric is then determined by the choice of a Lagrangian submanifold of the fixed point locus of this involution. This resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita double bimodule and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with Lagrangian boundary conditions, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

Abstract: The corrections to the cosmological models induced by non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion are considered. To determine these corrections in explicit form, the power-law parametrization of these corrections are proposed. The estimates of possible influence of non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion on cosmological parameters for inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models due to the observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <title>Analytic decay width of the Higgs boson to massive bottom quarks at order $\alpha_s^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay into bottom quarks is the dominant decay channel contributing to its total decay width, which can be used to measure the bottom quark Yukawa coupling and mass. This decay width has been computed up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)$ for the process induced by the bottom quark Yukawa coupling, assuming massless final states, and the corresponding corrections beyond $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ are found to be less than $0.2\%$. We present an analytical result for the decay into massive bottom quarks at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ that includes the contribution from the top quark Yukawa coupling induced process. We have made use of the optical theorem, canonical differential equations and the regular basis in the calculation and expressed the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms and elliptic functions. We propose a systematic and unified procedure to derive the $\epsilon$-factorized differential equation for the three-loop kite integral family, which includes the three-loop banana integrals as a sub-sector. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections increase the decay width, relative to the result up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, by $1\%$ due to the large logarithms $\log^i (m_H^2/m_b^2)$ with $ 1\le i \le 4 $ in the small bottom quark mass limit. The coefficient of the double logarithms is proportional to $C_A-C_F$, which is the typical color structure in the resummation of soft quark contributions at subleading power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a new framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the fundamental role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light in the form of the experimentally discovered quantum photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantized gravitational, informational, thermodynamical, traditional, and other attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, the very early formation of galaxies, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and large-scale structures. Precise calculations have shown that primordial protogalaxies with supermassive black holes at their centers of gravity were formed before the recombination epoch. By solving issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter and dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and it's impact to cosmology. In such a way PBHs serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that presented PBH physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical issues, paradoxes and "mysteries", such as the accelerated evolution of the Universe established by JWST and other observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a brane-world context in which our universe would be a four-dimensional brane embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime or bulk, wormhole geometries are induced on branes. In this article, the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the Molina-Neves wormhole are obtained on the brane using the Nakas-Kanti approach, which starts from a regular five-dimensional spacetime to obtain known black hole and wormhole solutions on the four-dimensional brane. From the bulk perspective, these wormholes are five-dimensional solutions supported by an exotic fluid, but from the brane perspective, such objects are wormholes not supported by any fields or particles that live on the four-dimensional spacetime. Thus, the cause of these wormholes is the bulk influence on the brane.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Correction to the Magnetic Moment of the Charged Lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression, up to the first-order relativistic correction, was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, distinguishing it from other generic Hamiltonians. Notably, our Hamiltonian is applicable to scenarios involving non-uniform magnetic fields, providing a more general framework for describing relativistic effects. Using this generalized Hamiltonian, we calculated the first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e \( g \)-factor (or equivalently, the magnetic moment) for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results provide a novel expression for the relativistic correction of order \(\alpha^2\) to the \( g \) factor, which explicitly depends on the azimuthal quantum number as \( m^2_j \) and reduces to the well-known Breit result for specific states. Both quantum field theory (QFT) and relativistic corrections contribute to the \( g \) factor of hydrogen-like ions. The QFT contribution is intrinsic, while the relativistic correction depends on the particle's kinematics and external electromagnetic field. For highly charged ions with \( Z \approx \sqrt{1/\alpha} \), relativistic effects become comparable to QFT corrections and play a significant role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Baryon Construction with $\eta^\prime$ Meson Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a potential link to quark--hadron continuity at high density. In retrospect, the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\eta'$ domain wall reveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers naturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or multi-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework, thereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development, with a special focus on the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f \geq 2$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, the criticality, the heat capacity, the zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

      <title>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical cosmological event horizon, which is valid to leading order for perturbations of a stationary asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>
