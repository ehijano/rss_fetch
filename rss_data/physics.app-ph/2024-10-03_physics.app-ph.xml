      <title>Time domain analysis of locally resonant elastic metamaterials under impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructure of a material can be engineered to achieve unique properties not found in nature. Microstructured materials, also known as metamaterials (MMs), can exhibit properties utilizing local resonance and dynamics of their heterogeneous microstructure that are activated below the traditional Bragg limit. In this study, the linear dynamic response of a low-frequency resonant ceramic MM slab is analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in the time domain. The MM is compared to monolithic slabs and other microstructured designs in terms of stress wave mitigation, peak load retardation, and energy transfer. Simulations are conducted using various boundary conditions and domain sizes to evaluate their influence on the performance. Potential graded slab designs and material damping effects are also discussed and are both shown to reduce the energy transmitted from the impact surface to the opposing surface significantly. The results showed that the MM slabs had superior performance in reducing the peak stress wave and reducing the transfer of energy. This study demonstrates that resonant ceramic MMs are a promising material design with unique and tunable properties that can be used for stress wave mitigation and structural protection applications.</description>

      <title>Three-plate graphene capacitor for high-density electric energy storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene possesses a unique combination of physical properties including high carrier mobility and high current density it can sustain. In contrast to bulk metals, graphene does not completely screen the external electrostatic field. In this work, we consider the possibility of utilizing these properties for building devices for high-density electric energy storage. We consider a three-plate parallel plate capacitor where the middle plate is made of graphene and negatively charged. The electric forces of attraction acting on the electrons on the middle plate are compensated as the electric fields on both sides of the plate are not screened. However, it brings the system to an unstable equilibrium state. To make system stable, we consider fast oscillations similar to ones in Kapitza pendulum. AC electric current through the middle graphene plane creates a magnetic field. In turn, Lorentz force squeezes moving electrons towards the center of the middle plane. We present the results of numerical modeling showing the effect of AC electric current on electron movement. According to the estimates, the pseudopotential produced by the AC current may exceed 60 eV at room temperature. Such a large value of the pseudopotential is due to the high mobility and large current density in graphene. The electric field intensity between the edge plates and the middle plate may exceed the breakdown value for a conventional double-plate parallel-plate capacitors leading to the increase in the electric energy storage. The electric breakdown of the graphene capacitor is limited by the mechanical strength of the side plates. It may be possible to enhance the volume electric energy density above the gasoline 34 MJ/L. We also describe possible experiments to validate this idea.</description>

      <title>Sub-Bragg Phenomena in Multilayered Vibroacoustic Phononic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond classical Bragg diffraction, we report on new sub-Bragg phenomena to achieve enhanced sound wave tunability in the low-frequency range in a multilayered acoustic metamaterial system. Remarkably, we reveal and study the formation of genuinely sub-wavelength Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps, generalizing the band-folding induced bandgaps in the literature. Additionally, we propose a methodology to widen sub-wavelength local resonance bandgaps by simultaneously hosting two local resonances within the same bandgap. These sub-Bragg bandgaps are realized in an axisymmetric vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial consisting of repetitive multilayered unit cells, each composed of two layers of membrane-cavity resonators. The resulting coupled sound-structure interaction system is analytically solved in closed form. Furthermore, the studied multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial exhibits sub-wavelength acoustical transparency, akin to electromagnetically induced transparency, and an acoustic analogue of low-frequency plasma oscillations, resulting in a plasma bandgap where wave propagation is entirely prohibited below the plasma frequency. These sub-wavelength phenomena, achieved predictively and well below the ubiquitous first-order Bragg diffraction range, provide broadband attenuation and superior wave manipulation capabilities for low-frequency sound. This highlights the potential of utilizing sound-structure interaction across diverse physical applications. Moreover, our findings can be extrapolated to wave propagation in broader classes of physical systems where sub-wavelength phenomena are crucial, including phononic and photonic crystals of more general configurations.</description>

      <title>Condensation phenomena of ions in an electrostatic logarithmic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Condition for Slow Wave Antennas: a Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof of the resonant property of linear periodically loaded antennas with subwavelength elements is obtained by applying a Lagrangian formalism. A Lagrangian is developed by modeling the antenna with lumped inductance and capacitance elements on a single line, thereby physically similar to the antenna and thus avoiding the inaccurate two parallel conductor transmission line model. An equation for the antenna current driven by an incident electromagnetic field is obtained via vector and scalar potentials. It is shown that periodic loading provides a means to shorten the resonant length while the antenna pattern remains unchanged. The Lagrangian model is validated through a calculation showing the loaded resonant length is determined by a product of a resonant half-wavelength dipole with the ratio of the free space velocity and the longitudinal traveling wave velocity. A periodically loaded disk-on-rod antenna example with simulations and measurements provides further validation of the mathematics.</description>

      <title>Infrasound Detection Using Polymer Networks in Liquid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recording and analyzing infrasound signals is essential to study natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, weather, or avalanches, but also has practical importance in aviation industry, optimization of wind turbines, and many more. However, the detection of faint infrasound signals is still a significant challenge as the transducers (e.g., mechanical, optical, and piezoelectric) are either difficult to integrate or do not provide sufficient sensitivity. Here, we propose an alternative principle to detecting infrasound, which is based on a free-standing liquid film covered with a polymeric organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor (OMIEC). This polymer is capable of conducting ions, as well as electrons/holes and serves as a direct electronic infrasound transducer due to the sensitivity of OMIECs to the local ion concentration in the liquid. We specifically address the detection of acoustic excitations within the infrasound regime and the dependency of the networks reaction to these stimuli on its conductive properties, mainly its impedance spectrum. The resulting sensor has a sensitivity of 613 muV Pa-1 and a power consumption of about 340 nW at 100 mHz, which puts these systems well within the range of commercial infrasound detectors, while offering significant advantages in terms of device complexity and integration.</description>

      <title>An Impedance Surface Technique for Wideband Matching and Miniaturization of Circular Patch Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a technique to enhance the performance of circular patch antennas using an embedded system of cylindrical impedance surfaces. The technique utilizes a derived analytical model of a circular patch antenna containing an arbitrary number of coaxial impedance surfaces along with nonlinear optimization algorithms. This allows for the calculation of the radius and impedance of each surface to achieve the desired matching frequency band for given antenna dimensions. We demonstrate two applications of adding an optimal set of impedance surfaces into a compact circular patch antenna, i.e. the expansion of the matching frequency band keeping constant antenna dimensions, and the miniaturization (height reduction) maintaining the constant bandwidth. Two corresponding versions of a cavity-backed circular patch antenna each having three impedance surfaces are synthesized. Practical implementations for both versions are designed and considered in full-wave numerical verification of analytically predicted properties. A comparison with the conventional method using multi-element microstrip matching circuits shows a benefit in radiation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Si-MOSFETs for Quantum Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Off-stoichiometry engineering of the electrical and optical properties of SrNbO$_3$ by oxide molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The highly conducting and transparent inorganic perovskites SrBO$_3$ with V, Nb, Mo, and their mixtures at the B-site have recently attracted the attention of the oxide electronics community as novel alternative transparent conducting oxides. For different applications from solar cells to transparent electronics, it is desirable to tune the optical transmission window in the ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) range. The conventional approach is substitutional design at the A- and/or B-site. Here, we suggest a method by engineering the off-stoichiometry of the perovskite, opening new pathways to broaden the range of applications without adding additional elements. For oxide molecular beam epitaxy grown SrNbO$_3$ on GdScO$_3$ substrates, we show that controlled Sr deficiency shifts the plasma edge from about 2 eV in the visible range into the near-infrared region, 1.37 eV (similar to stoichiometric SrVO$_3$). Here, epitaxial growth allows going beyond the limitations of phase stability set by thermodynamics. The suggested approach opens a new design toolbox by including controlled vacancy sites as quasi-substitutional virtual elements.</description>

      <title>A method to estimate well flowing gas-oil ratio and composition using pressure and temperature measurements across a production choke, a seed composition of oil and gas, and a thermodynamic simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and demonstrate a method to estimate the flowing gas-oil ratio and composition of a hydrocarbon well stream using measurements of pressure and temperature across a production choke. The method consists of using a numerical solver on a thermodynamic simulator to recombine a seed oil and gas until the simulated temperature drop across the choke is equal to the measured value. This method is meant for cases where it is not possible to measure periodically individual well composition. A study case and reference solution were generated using the reservoir model presented in the SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) comparative case Nr. 5 linked with a process simulator. Time profiles of well producing gas-oil ratio, wellstream compositions, compositions of surface conditions oil and gas, and temperature drop across the choke were generated with the models. The method proposed was then employed to estimate the flowing gas-oil ratio of the reference solution. Results show that the proposed method predicts with reasonable accuracy (maximum 12% percent error) the well gas-oil ratio and compositions during the life of the field when using compositions of surface oil and gas from initial time. When using compositions of surface oil and gas from later times, the prediction accuracy of the gas-oil ratio improves at those times but worsens for times before and after. A measurement error for the temperature drop across the choke of at least 0.01 {\deg}C is required to achieve convergence of the method. The mean percent error between the predicted and real mole fractions has an upper bound in time of 21% when using initial surface oil and gas as seed compositions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Annealing on Flexoelectricity in Hafnium Oxide (HfO2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is universal in all dielectrics, effective at high temperatures, and a promising transduction technique for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). However, as flexoelectricity is still in its early stages, many aspects require further investigation. Understanding how flexoelectricity depends on material parameters like crystallographic phase and how temperature might affect it, is important for selecting and optimizing the right material for technological applications. This work studies the influence of high-temperature annealing (and the consequent crystallization) in the flexoelectricity of hafnium oxide (HfO2), a material with significant technological relevance. We measure the flexoelectric coefficient for amorphous (not annealed) and annealed (slightly crystalline) phases of HfO2, with samples annealed in nitrogen or oxygen atmospheres. Our results indicate that the amorphous phase of HfO2 exhibits the highest flexoelectric coefficient (105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m), while annealed samples show a significant decrease, with the lowest value in nitrogen-annealed samples (26 $\pm$ 4 pC/m). Samples annealed in an oxygen atmosphere improve flexoelectric properties (54 $\pm$ 6 pC/m) compared to those annealed in nitrogen. Using cross-sectional imaging, X-ray diffraction, resonance frequency characterization, and relative permittivity measurements, we find that annealing promotes crystallization into the tetragonal phase and increases internal stress within the HfO2 layer, while most other parameters remain constant. We attribute the differences in flexoelectricity from the annealed samples to the quantity of oxygen vacancies in hafnium oxide. These oxygen vacancies in hafnium oxide seem to negatively affect the flexoelectric coefficient. This finding can be applied to optimize materials to enhance their flexoelectric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is being increasingly used as an interesting transducer membrane in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS, respectively) due to its atomical thickness, extremely high carrier mobility, high mechanical strength and piezoresistive electromechanical transductions. NEMS devices based on graphene feature increased sensitivity, reduced size, and new functionalities. In this review, we discuss the merits of graphene as a functional material for MEMS and NEMS, the related properties of graphene, the transduction mechanisms of graphene MEMS and NEMS, typical transfer methods for integrating graphene with MEMS substrates, methods for fabricating suspended graphene, and graphene patterning and electrical contact. Consequently, we provide an overview of devices based on suspended and nonsuspended graphene structures. Finally, we discuss the potential and challenges of applications of graphene in MEMS and NEMS. Owing to its unique features, graphene is a promising material for emerging MEMS, NEMS and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Four ribbons of double-layer graphene suspending masses for NEMS applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass for nanomechanical systems have been rarely studied. Here, we report three types of nanomechanical devices consisting of graphene ribbons (two ribbons, four ribbons-cross and four ribbons-parallel) with suspended Si proof masses and studied their mechanical properties. The resonance frequencies and built-in stresses of three types of devices ranged from tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz, and from 82.61 MPa to 545.73 MPa, respectively, both of which decrease with the increase of the size of proof mass. The devices with four graphene ribbons featured higher resonance frequencies and spring constants, but lower built-in stresses than two ribbon devices under otherwise identical conditions. The Young's modulus and fracture strain of double-layer graphene were measured to be 0.34 TPa and 1.13% respectively, by using the experimental data and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Our studies would lay the foundation for understanding of mechanical properties of graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass and their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

Abstract: Graphene has the great potential to be used for humidity sensing due to ultrahigh surface area and conductivity. However, the impact of different atomic layers of graphene on SiO2/Si substrate on the humidity sensing have not been studied yet. In this paper, we fabricated three types of humidity sensors on SiO2/Si substrate based on one to three atomic layers of graphene, in which the sensing areas of graphene are 75 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m and 45 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m, respectively. We studied the impact of both the number of atomic layers of graphene and the sensing areas of graphene on the responsivity and response/recovery time of the prepared graphene-based humidity sensors. We found the relative resistance change of the prepared devices decreased with the increase of number of atomic layers of graphene under the same change of relative humidity. Further, devices based on tri-layer graphene showed the fastest response/recovery time while devices based on double-layer graphene showed the slowest response/recovery time. Finally, we chose the devices based on double-layer graphene that have relatively good responsivity and stability for application in respiration monitoring and contact-free finger monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Inhomogeneity of the transmitted radiofrequency field B1+ is a major factor hindering the image quality in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at high field strengths. Here, a novel approach is presented, to locally modulate the B1+ utilizing an array of high permittivity materials with switchable connections. A 3$\times$3 array of barium titanate suspension elements was constructed, with two PIN diode-based switchable connectors per element. Electromagnetic simulations were performed to determine configurations that produce strong B1+ modulation. Remote B1+ field switching was tested in a disk- and and a torso-shaped phantom at 3T by applying different bias voltages to the PIN diodes. The attained B1+ modulation was assessed at various switching pattern positions and various depths within the phantoms. The configuration with the strongest effect size has produced up to 11% modulation in simulations at 15 mm depth, with excellent translation properties. The effects were successfully replicated in phantoms, with a 5 V bias voltage producing up to 11.6$\pm$0.2% modulation. At the relative depth of the human heart, up to 6% of modulation was observed in the torso phantom. The presented method may provide a promising direction for cost-effective, and adaptive B1+ shimming without changes to the scanner hardware.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis design of non-stoichiometric Fe2P-type alloys with giant magnetocaloric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-stoichiometric Fe$_2$P-type (FeMnP$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$)$_{1-x}$(FeV)$_{x}$ alloys ( $x=0, 0.01$, $0.02$, and $0.03$) have been investigated as potential candidates for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. The magnetic ordering temperature decreases with increasing FeV concentration, $x$, which can be ascribed to decreased ferromagnetic coupling strength between the magnetic atoms. The strong magnetoelastic coupling in these alloys results in large values of the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M$); $15.7$ J/kgK, at $2$ T magnetic field for the $x = 0$ alloy. $\Delta S_M$ decreases with increasing $x$. Results from M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy reveal that the average hyperfine field (in the ferromagnetic state) and average center shift (in the paramagnetic state) have the same decreasing trend as $\Delta S_M$. The thermal hysteresis ($\Delta T_{hyst}$) of the magnetic phase transition decreases with increasing $x$, while the mechanical stability of the alloys improves due to the reduced lattice volume change across the magnetoelastic phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$, which highly depends on $\Delta T_{hyst}$, is $1.7$ K at $1.9$ T applied field for the $x = 0.02$ alloy.</description>

      <title>The mechanics and physics of twisted and coiled polymer actuators</title>

Abstract: Twisted and coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) generate large contractile mechanical work mimicking natural muscles, which makes them suitable for robotics and health-assistive devices. Understanding the mechanism of nylon TCPA remains challenging due to the interplay between their intricate geometry, chirality, residual stresses, and material microstructure. This study integrates a material microstructure model with rod theory to analytically predict the equilibrium helical shape of the nylon TCPA after fabrication and to explain the observed contraction mechanism upon stimulation. The first ingredient of the model is to treat nylon as a two-phase thermomechanical microstructure system capable of storing strain energy and exchanging it among the two phases. This is validated by characterizing the torsional actuation response of twisted and annealed nylon fibers. The second ingredient of the model is to use the classic Kirchhoff Rod Theory and add a necessary term that couples the bending and twisting energy. Validation with experiments shows that the model captures the equilibrium and longitudinal stiffness of the TCPA in both active and passive states, and the stimulated contraction under external load. Importantly, the model quantifies the influence of the stored energy level on the actuation performance. These concepts can be extended to other types of TCPAs and could enable new material design.</description>

      <title>Selecting Alternative Metals for Advanced Interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interconnect resistance and reliability have emerged as critical factors limiting the performance of advanced CMOS circuits. With the slowdown of transistor scaling, interconnect scaling has become the primary driver of continued circuit miniaturization. The associated scaling challenges for interconnects are expected to further intensify in future CMOS technology nodes. As interconnect dimensions approach the 10 nm scale, the limitations of conventional Cu dual-damascene metallization are becoming increasingly difficult to overcome, spurring over a decade of focused research into alternative metallization schemes. The selection of alternative metals is a highly complex process, requiring consideration of multiple criteria, including resistivity at reduced dimensions, reliability, thermal performance, process technology readiness, and sustainability. This tutorial introduces the fundamental criteria for benchmarking and selecting alternative metals and reviews the current state of the art in this field. It covers materials nearing adoption in high-volume manufacturing, materials currently under active research, and potential future directions for fundamental study. While early alternatives to Cu metallization have recently been introduced in commercial CMOS devices, the search for the optimal interconnect metal remains ongoing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Beamforming Optimization for Quantized Phase-only Massive MIMO Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative quantum-inspired method for beamforming (BF) optimization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays. The method leverages the simulated bifurcation (SB) algorithm to address the complex combinatorial optimization problem due to the quantized phase configuration. We propose novel encoding techniques for high-bit phase quantization, which are then mapped into Ising spins. This enables efficient construction of the Hamiltonians and subsequent optimization of BF patterns. The results clearly demonstrate that the SB optimizer surpasses traditional schemes such as digital BF, holographic algorithms and genetic algorithms, offering faster convergence and higher solution quality. The impressive capability of the SB optimizer to handle complex BF scenarios, including sidelobe suppression and multiple beams with nulls, is undoubtedly demonstrated through several application cases. These findings strongly suggest that quantum-inspired methods have great potential to advance MIMO techniques in next-generation wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Methane Sensing via Unbalanced Nonlinear Interferometry using a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a high-sensitivity, rapid, and low-cost method for methane sensing based on a nonlinear interferometer. This method utilizes signal photons generated by stimulated parametric down-conversion (ST-PDC), enabling the use of a silicon detector to capture high-precision methane absorption spectra in the mid-infrared region. By controlling the system loss, we achieve more significant changes in visibility, thereby increasing sensitivity. The methane concentration within a gas cell is determined accurately. In addition, ST-PDC enables long-distance sensing and the capability to measure low ambient methane concentrations in the real world. A low-cost CMOS camera is employed to capture spatial interference fringes, ensuring fast and efficient detection.</description>
