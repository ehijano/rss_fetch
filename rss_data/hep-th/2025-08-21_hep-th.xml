      <title>Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture: scalars can be turned on in a black hole, but they do not have continuous independent hairy parameters.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Wormholes and Gravitational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean wormholes are known to encode important non-perturbative effects in the physics of quantum black holes. In this paper, we discuss the slicing of Euclidean wormholes along a time-reflection symmetric slice which treats half of the Euclidean geometry as a gravitational machinery to produce a semi-classical state. This type of state preparation is different from Hartle-Hawking states prepared with the CFT path integral, such as the thermofield-double state. Nevertheless, the two different types of states have order one overlaps provided the gravitational data agrees on the initial data slice. This raises an interesting puzzle: one can easily construct an infinite family of semi-classical states that have order one overlap with the thermofield double state, while having a very different Euclidean preparation. We provide a microscopic description of wormhole states in the dual CFT and reformulate the factorization puzzle in the language of entanglement and the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Massive spin 3 and Metric-Affine Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric Metric-Affine Gravity is a theory of gravity with an independent non-metric connection, and zero torsion. It can be thought of as ordinary metric gravity coupled to a rank-three tensor Q, symmetric in one pair of indices. This field carries a spin-three degree of freedom. We find that, in contrast to the totally symmetric case, it is possible to arrange the parameters in the Lagrangian, so that, at the linearized level, the spin-three state, either alone or in combination with a spin-0 state, has a healthy propagation.</description>

      <title>Thermal description of braneworld effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy effective theories provide the natural description of four-dimensional physics in higher-dimensional geometries, where the imprint of the bulk appears as parameters of the lower dimensional theory. Motivated by the recent progress in the first-order thermodynamic formulation of modified gravity theories, we investigate the thermodynamics of effective theories in braneworld scenarios and thereby the attractor mechanism towards general relativity in such theories. We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model where the low-energy theory on either brane is of scalar-tensor nature with the extra-dimensional radion playing the role of the scalar. We study the thermodynamic implications of a non-vanishing gravitational contribution to the radion potential, and further explore the dynamics in the presence of a bulk stabilizing field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb branch amplitudes of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory display infrared properties different from their conformal counterparts. While the four-leg amplitude is known to very high perturbative orders, amplitudes of higher multiplicity fall into an uncharted territory starting already from two loops. The reason for this is that they are not easily amenable to traditional techniques like canonical differential equations due to the uncontrolled swelling of solutions to integration-by-parts identities. In this paper, we break the barrier for the five-leg amplitude using a technique based on the analysis of Newton polytopes corresponding to Feynman/Schwinger integrands and their tropical geometry. Specifically, we analytically evaluate the near mass-shell limit of the off-shell pentabox in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic topology for a broad class of asymptotically charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories, examining how scalar coupling parameters and spacetime dimensions influence black hole thermodynamics. Employing a topological approach that utilizes the torsion number of vector fields constructed from the generalized free energy, we characterize black hole states as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through analytical solutions spanning dimensions $d = 4$, $d=5$, and $d=6$, including the Gubser-Rocha model, we demonstrate that variations in the dilaton coupling constant $\delta$, particularly near its critical value $\delta_c$, induce transitions between distinct thermodynamic topological phases. Our analysis reveals that certain black hole solutions constitute a novel class designated as $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, characterized by a torsion number $W = 1$ that corresponds to a unique stability structure. We establish that Gubser-Rocha models belong to this topological classification. These results significantly expand the existing classification framework while reinforcing thermodynamic topology as a robust analytical tool for probing the universal properties of black holes in both gravitational and holographic contexts. The findings provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic couplings and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior in extended gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Toward a Consistent Definition of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new definition of holographic entanglement entropy in the framework of static patch holography for de Sitter space. Using the replica trick and twist operator formalism, we derive an entropy functional in three-dimensional de Sitter space expressed through de Sitter Green's functions. Since the naive Ryu-Takayanagi prescription in de Sitter spacetime fails to satisfy strong subadditivity, we demand that our proposed formula be consistent with the fundamental entropic inequalities. The resulting conditions place nontrivial constraints on the undetermined parameter space of static patch holography. Our results demonstrate that entanglement inequalities provide a sharp diagnostic for candidate definitions of entanglement entropy in de Sitter holography and offer quantitative evidence in support of static patch holography as a consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Worldline Formulations of Covariant Fracton Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop worldline formulations of covariant fracton gauge theories. These are a one-parameter family of gauge theories of a rank-two symmetric tensor field, invariant under a scalar gauge transformation involving a double derivative. These theories, which can be interpreted as linearized gravity theories invariant under longitudinal diffeomorphisms, provide a covariant framework for studying Lorentz-breaking fracton quasiparticles, which are excitations with restricted mobility due to dipole-moment conservation. We construct three worldline models. The first two are obtained by deducing their constraint structure directly from the spacetime gauge transformations. By applying BRST quantization, we show that these models reproduce the BV spectrum and the associated BRST transformations of two specific fracton theories. The third model is defined as a deformation of the second one: although free, it is analyzed by drawing inspiration from the standard treatment of interacting worldline systems, and is shown to capture almost the entire family of covariant fracton theories. Finally, we discuss the gauge-fixing, comparing the BV-BRST spacetime perspective with the worldline analogue of the ``Siegel gauge" employed in string field theory.</description>

      <title>The Renormalized Yukawa Hamiltonian: Spectrum, Parton Distribution Functons, and Resource Estimates for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the partition function and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the partition function and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the partition function of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

      <title>Holographic Extended Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method as a minimal geometric deformation. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, for an ensemble of fixed volume and central charge, the dual CFT displays a van der Waals-like phase structure. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Generalized Ryu-Takayanagi Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalized version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories. We use a recent framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. For diffeomorphism invariant field theories, a functional integral expression for their density matrices was recently given and then used to derive bounds on phase space volumes in the considered submanifold associated to $B.$ These bounds formalize the gravitational entropy bound. Here, we present an implication of this derivation in that we show the obtained functional integral expression for density matrices to be naturally suited for the replica trick. Correspondingly, we prove a functional integral expression for the associated entanglement entropies and derive a practical prescription for their evaluation to leading order and beyond. An important novelty of our approach is the contact to phase space. This allows us both to obtain a prescription for entanglement entropies in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories not necessarily possessing a holographic dual as well as to use entanglement entropies to study their phase space structure. In the case of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our prescription consistently reproduces and hence provides a natural and independent proof of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as well as its various generalizations. These include the covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal, Dong's proposal for higher-derivative gravity as well as the quantum extremal surface prescription.</description>

      <title>Global Anomalies in Sigma Models with Majorana--Weyl Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a global sigma model anomaly in two-dimensional sigma models with Majorana--Weyl fermions coupled to a sigma model field with target space~$G$. The anomaly originates from the nontrivial topology of the space of maps and manifests as a phase in the fermion path integral. Using the global anomaly formula expressed in terms of the reduced~$\eta$-invariant, we demonstrate that this anomaly modifies the standard quantization condition of the Wess--Zumino term on~$G$, in close analogy with the three-dimensional parity anomaly. However, our situation is more refined and highlights a qualitatively new phenomenon in two dimensions: whereas in three dimensions the anomalous quantization restricts the level to lie in a half-integer lattice, here it can force the level to take \emph{arbitrary real values}. Furthermore, our results support the consistency of the low-energy description proposed by Gaiotto, Johnson-Freyd, and Witten for three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory on an interval, by highlighting a subtle and qualitatively distinct nature of the sigma-model anomalies.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Thermal Machine: Harnessing Relativistic Effects to Surpass Carnot Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-level maser quantum thermal machine in which the system-reservoir interaction is modeled via Unruh-DeWitt type coupling, with one or both reservoirs undergoing relativistic motion relative to the working medium. Motion induces Doppler reshaping of the reservoir spectra, modifying energy-exchange rates and enabling operation beyond the Carnot efficiency at finite power. We numerically analyze families of efficiency-power curves and extract the analytic form of a generalized Carnot bound, which recovers the Carnot limit. In addition, Doppler reshaping alters the boundaries between heat-engine and refrigerator operation, making it possible to extract positive work even in the absence of a temperature gradient. These findings establish relativistic motion as a genuine thermodynamic resource.</description>

      <title>The Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic charged gas in the trace-fixed particle frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we provide a thorough discussion of the first-order Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic simple charged gas propagating in an arbitrary fixed background spacetime and electromagnetic field. Motivated by a rigorous study of the linearized collision operator, we argue that the most natural thermodynamic frame to describe dissipative relativistic fluids is the trace-fixed particle frame. This frame determines the state variables by requiring compatibility of the first few moments of the one-particle distribution function with those of the J\"uttner distribution. The resulting constitutive relations are derived, and it is shown that the corresponding transport coefficients are, in fact, frame-independent if suitably defined. Moreover, we discuss the representation freedom for these relations within the microscopic approach. As shown in previous work, when this freedom is suitably exploited, the resulting fluid theory gives rise to strongly hyperbolic and causal evolution equations for which global equilibria are stable.</description>

      <title>Tropicalized quantum field theory and global tropical sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to tropicalize scalar quantum field theory and show that tropicalized massive scalar quantum field theory is exactly solvable. This exact solution manifests as a non-linear recursion equation fulfilled by the expansion coefficients of the quantum effective action. Geometrically, this recursion computes specific volumes of moduli spaces of metric graphs and is thereby analogous to Mirzakhani's volume recursions on the moduli space of curves. Building on this exact solution, we construct an algorithm that samples points from the moduli space of graphs approximately proportional to their perturbative contribution. Remarkably, this algorithm requires only polynomial time and memory, suggesting that perturbative quantum field theory computations lie in the polynomial-time complexity class, while all known algorithms for evaluating individual Feynman integrals are exponential in time and memory. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, we evaluate the primitive contribution to the $\phi^4$ beta function at 50 loops with a proof-of-concept implementation.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger--Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the backreaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator (RSET) for a quantum scalar field acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We find the RSET for a nonrotating thermal state on global AdS in three dimensions and compare this with results from relativistic kinetic theory. We then solve the linearized quantum-corrected Einstein equations. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study duality transformations of the star-square relation and the generalized star-triangle relation for Ising-like integrable lattice spin models. The integrable models are obtained via gauge/YBE correspondence which connects the supersymmetric gauge theories and lattice spin models of statistical mechanics. By the use of integral identities coming from the duality of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, we construct hyperbolic, lens hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational solutions to the duality transformations. These duality transformations allow us to construct spin lattice models with four-spin (the star-square relation) and three-spin (the generalized star-triangle relation) interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We study the supersymmetric structure of the spin current in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. By coupling the stress tensor multiplet to a vierbein multiplet we identify a spin current with the Hodge dual of the bottom component of the stress tensor multiplet in a wide range of theories. This implies that in holographic theories the Hodge dual of the $R$ current may serve as a spin current, paving the way for holographic studies of theories with background torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate mixed-state bipartite entanglement between multiple disjoint intervals using the computable cross-norm criterion (CCNR). We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity for $2$d massless compact boson. The expression for $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of $n$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity do not possess a $Z_n$ symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected R\'enyi entropy related to the $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity. This Reflected R\'enyi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the $2$d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

Abstract: We study the 2D fermionic SYK model with Majorana fermions, featuring a kinetic term with a quartic expression and a $2q$-body interaction with Gaussian disorder. By minimizing the effective action or solving the SD equation for $q=1$, we determine that the appropriate ansatz involves zero spins. Our computation of the Lyapunov exponent shows violations of chaos and unitarity bounds. The gravitational dual corresponds to AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity with a finite radial cut-off, even if we lose the non-zero spins. We also extend the SYK model to higher dimensions while maintaining a similar SD equation in the IR.</description>

      <title>Analytic Torsion from Chern-Simons theory via the $(2,0)$-theory on Dicyclic Orbifolds of $S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Witten index of the $(2,0)$-theory compactified on spaces of the form $S^3/\Gamma\times S^2$, with a freely acting group $\Gamma$, and with external string sources implemented via timelike surface operator insertions, is expressed in terms of Ray-Singer torsion of $S^3/\Gamma$ and characters of irreducible representations of $\Gamma$. We compute it explicitly for the Dicyclic groups $\Gamma=\text{Dic}_k$. The torsion and characters are generally irrational numbers, but they nicely combine to an integer index. Alternatively, the Witten index can be computed from Chern-Simons theory on $S^2$, and Ray-Singer torsion on $S^3/\text{Dic}_k$ is thus computable from Chern-Simons theory. The matching of the Witten index calculated by these dual approaches reveals new details about the partition function of the $(2,0)$-theory with surface operators.</description>

Abstract: We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lassalle-Nekrasov correspondence. A family of operators are constructed based on the spherical degenerate double affine Hecke algebra. In terms of these operators, we provide concise representations and constraints for the generalized hypergeometric functions. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel type CS models. Then based on the generalized Laplace transformation of Jack polynomials, we construct certain two integral chains and analyze the superintegrability property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the supersymmetric defect indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills theories which are simultaneously decorated by the BPS line operators and the boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the two-point functions of the boundary 't Hooft lines of magnetic charges associated with the minuscule representations in the presence of the regular Nahm pole boundary conditions can be obtained by applying the Higgsing prescription to the half-indices of the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Accordingly, we find precise matching of the indices for pairs of the S-dual configurations with the Wilson lines and Neumann boundary conditions and those with the 't Hooft lines and the regular Nahm pole boundary conditions. Alternatively, we analytically compute the indices by means of the inner product of the Macdonald polynomials to find the exact closed-form expressions.</description>

      <title>Light and Shadow OPEs: A Carroll Symmetric Approach to Flat Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we fix the leading term in the operator algebra of light-transformed operators in the context of flat space holography. Starting with light-transformed graviton correlators, we show that the OPE obtained by taking the collinear limit satisfies translation symmetry at the leading order not independently but with assistance from the sub-leading order. Motivated by this result, we start with a general CFT-like ansatz for the OPE and, by keeping track of the sub-leading term, derive an expression for the scaling dimension of the operator appearing in the leading term. We further show that we can fix the OPE coefficient corresponding to this term as well. We use this result to find the OPE for well-studied theories like gravity, Yang-Mills and Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, and find that the scaling dimension found from our formula matches with the one obtained by looking at the collinear limit of bulk momentum space vertices. We initiate a similar study for operators in the shadow basis by looking at the OPE of shadow-transformed graviton correlators.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Structure Underlying Pole-Skipping Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic Green's function becomes ambiguous, taking the indeterminate form `$0/0$', at an infinite set of special frequencies and momenta known as ``pole-skipping points''. In this work, we propose that these pole-skipping points can be used to reconstruct both the interior and exterior geometry of a static, planar-symmetric black hole in the bulk. The entire reconstruction procedure is fully analytical and only involves solving a system of linear equations. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole, its $T\bar{T}$-deformed counterparts, as well as geometries with Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling-violation. Within this framework, other geometric quantities, such as the vacuum Einstein equations, can also be reinterpreted directly in terms of pole-skipping data. Moreover, our approach reveals a hidden algebraic structure governing the pole-skipping points of Klein-Gordon equations of the form $(\nabla^{2} + V(r))\phi(r) = 0$: only a subset of these points is independent, while the remainder is constrained by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial identities in the pole-skipping momenta. These identities are universal, as confirmed by their validity across a broad class of bulk geometries with varying dimensionality, boundary asymptotics, and perturbation modes.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. Renormalization group equations in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) EFT describe wee parton correlations and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in the CGC EFT has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable between gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this semi-classical double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.</description>

      <title>Degenerate conformal blocks for the $W_3$ algebra at c=2 and connection probabilities in the triple dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a homogeneous system of $d+8$ linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in $d$ variables arising from two-dimensional Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with a $W_3$-symmetry algebra. In the CFT context, $d$ PDEs are third-order and correspond to the null-state equations, whereas the remaining 8 PDEs (five being second-order and three being first-order) correspond to the $W_3$ global Ward identities. In the case of central charge $c=2$, we construct a subspace of the space of all solutions which grow no faster than a power law. We call this subspace the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks, and we provide a basis expressed in terms of Specht polynomials associated with column-strict, rectangular Young tableaux with three columns. The dimension of this space is a Kostka number which coincides with CFT predictions, hence we conjecture that it exhausts the space of all solutions having a power law bound. Moreover, we prove that the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks is an irreducible representation of a certain diagram algebra defined from $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs that we call Kuperberg algebra. Finally, we prove a formula relating the $W_3$ conformal blocks at $c=2$ we constructed to Kenyon and Shi's scaling limits of connection probabilities in the triple dimer model. For more general central charges, we expect that $W_3$ conformal blocks are related to scaling limits of probabilities in lattice models based on $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs.</description>

      <title>Generators of Local Lorentz Transformation in ADM-Vielbein Formalism of Gravitational Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity contains 16 variables in the framework of ADM-Vielbein formalism which are 6 more than metric formalism. These variables emerge due to additional symmetry of Local Lorentz Transformations. In the framework of the Hamiltonian approach, it is expected to find first class constraints which generate this gauge symmetry. We introduce the complete form of such constraints and show that they exactly obey the algebra of the Lorentz group.</description>

      <title>Generalized Statistics on Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level framework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a universal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian excitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving the statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial dimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose many-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required sequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality constraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the resulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them efficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of particles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and membrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant corresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a non-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids any short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes a precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body dynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that constrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <title>The Signals of the Doomsday</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture, a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the Kaluza--Klein graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is adequately captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements (from DES, Union3 or Pantheon+) and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. DESI and SN datasets independently favor non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$, respectively, both lying within the expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ range suggested by the Swampland criteria. Moreover, our best fit value $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ is remarkably consistent with the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of nuclear collisions with elongated structure of $^{20}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from the study of $^{20}$Ne$-$$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.8 TeV using the Monte Carlo Pythia8/Angantyr model. Angantyr models heavy-ion collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions, without incorporating collective effects. We construct a bi-pyramidal structure of $^{20}$Ne nucleus composed of five $\alpha$-clusters and compare its collision dynamics against those generated using Woods-Saxon nuclear density distribution. The results are further compared for different orientations of the $^{20}$Ne nuclei, including tip-tip, body-body, body-tip, and random orientations of the bi-pyramidal structure. The results show that the geometric arrangement of $\alpha$-clusters in the $^{20}$Ne nucleus significantly influences the particle production patterns in final state particle multiplicity and mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_T \rangle$). These results highlight the sensitivity of final state observables to the nuclear structure and orientation of colliding nuclei, providing insights into the dynamics of small collision systems, even in non-hydrodynamic framework.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections and wavefunction renormalization for atoms, nuclei, and other heavy composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-loop QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where we identify a number of effects that arise at one loop that are, to the best of our knowledge, not included in current extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. In particular we find an electromagnetic isospin breaking correction at $O(\alpha)$ in addition to the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ corrections from the intranuclear Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>
