      <title>Combinatorial Ricci Flows and Hyperbolic Structures on a Class of Compact $3$-Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a combinatorial Ricci flow on closed pseudo $3$-manifolds $(M,\mathcal{T})$. We prove that if every edge in the triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ has valence at least $9$, then the combinatorial Ricci flow converges exponentially fast to a hyperbolic metric. As a consequence, for any compact $3$-manifold $N$ with boundary admitting an ideal triangulation $\mathcal{T}_N$ whose edges all have valence at least $9$, there exists a unique complete hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary on $N$ such that $\mathcal{T}_N$ is isotopic to a geometric decomposition of $N$. This provides a partial solution to the conjecture of Costantino, Frigerio, Martelli and Petronio, and hence an affirmative answer of Thurston's geometric ideal triangulation conjecture for such manifolds. Moreover, we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds for the resulting hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Random infinite ideal angled graphs and ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to develop the uniformization and boundary theory of random infinite ideal hyperbolic polyhedra (abbr. IHP) and their dual 1-skeleton, i.e., ideal angled graphs (abbr. IAG) from multiple perspectives, including combinatorics, geometry, analysis and random walks. For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\rho):=\sum_{e\ni\rho}\Theta_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\mathbb{E}[T(\rho)]=2\pi$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\partial\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry. This key estimate makes it possible to extend the boundary theory beyond triangulations.</description>

      <title>K-theory of Etesi C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08237v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $C^*$-algebra $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$ of a smooth 4-dimensional manifold $\mathscr{M}$ introduced by G\'abor Etesi. It is proved that the $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$ is a stationary AF-algebra. We calculate the topological and smooth invariants of $\mathscr{M}$ in terms of the K-theory of the $C^*$-algebra $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$. Using Gompf's Stable Diffeomorphism Theorem, it is shown that all smoothings of $\mathscr{M}$ form a torsion abelian group. The latter is isomorphic to the Brauer group of a number field associated to the K-theory of $\mathbb{E}_{\mathscr{M}}$.</description>

      <title>Ray structures on Teichm\"uller Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there may be many Thurston metric geodesics between a pair of points in Teichm\"uller space, we find that by imposing an additional energy minimization constraint on the geodesics, thought of as limits of harmonic map rays, we select a unique Thurston geodesic through those points. Extending the target surface to the Thurston boundary yields, for each point $Y$ in Teichm\"uller space, an \enquote{exponential map} of rays from that point $Y$ onto Teichm\"uller space with visual boundary the Thurston boundary of Teichm\"uller space.
  We first depict harmonic map ray structures on Teichm\"uller space as a geometric transition between Teichm\"uller ray structures and Thurston geodesic ray structures. In particular, by appropriately degenerating the source of a harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces (along \enquote{harmonic map dual rays}), the harmonic map rays through the target converge to a Thurston geodesic; by appropriately degenerating the target of the harmonic map, those harmonic map dual rays through the domain converge to Teichm\"uller geodesics. We then extend this transition to one from Teichm\"uller disks through Hopf differential disks to stretch-earthquake disks. These results apply to surfaces with boundary, resolving a question on stretch maps between such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of the Thurston metric on Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Thurston (asymmetric) metric on Teichm\"uller space, the defect from being uniquely geodesic is described by the envelope, defined as the union of geodesics from the initial point to the terminal point.
  Using the harmonic stretch lines we defined recently, we describe the shape of envelopes as a cone over a cone over a space, defined from a topological invariant of the initial and terminal points. In addition, we show that the envelope is always contractible. We prove that envelopes vary continuously with their endpoints. We also provide a parametrization of out-envelopes and in-envelopes in terms of straightened measured laminations complementary to the prescribed maximally stretched laminations.
  We extend most of these results to the metrically infinite envelopes which have a terminal point on the Thurston boundary, illustrating some of the nuances of these with examples, and describing the accumulation set. Finally, we develop a new characterization of harmonic stretch lines that avoids a limiting process.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new version of symplectic annular Khovanov homology and establish spectral sequences from (i) the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of a knot to the link Floer homology of the lift of the annular axis in the double branched cover; (ii) the symplectic Khovanov homology of a two-periodic knot to the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of its quotient; and (iii) the symplectic Khovanov homology of a strongly invertible knot to the cone of the axis-moving map between the symplectic annular Khovanov homology of the two resolutions of its quotient.</description>

      <title>Positroid Links and Braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study braid varieties and their relation to open positroid varieties. We discuss four different types of braids associated to open positroid strata and show that their associated Legendrian links are all Legendrian isotopic. In particular, we prove that each open positroid stratum can be presented as the augmentation variety for four different Legendrian fronts described in terms of either permutations, juggling patterns, cyclic rank matrices or Le diagrams. We also relate braid varieties to open Richardson varieties and brick manifolds, showing that the latter provide projective compactifications of braid varieties, with normal crossing divisors at infinity.</description>
