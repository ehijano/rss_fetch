      <title>A systematic study of initial state quark energy loss in fixed target proton nucleus collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter by studying the ratio of Drell-Yan production cross sections in fixed-target proton-nucleus (p + A) collisions. We analyze Drell-Yan production cross-section data from the Fermilab E866 and E906 experiments using two different quark energy loss parametrization models and various parton distribution functions for 800 GeV and 120 GeV proton beams incident on light and heavy nuclear targets. The sensitivity of the energy loss parameter on the employed parton distribution function has been thoroughly investigated. Our results have been used to predict the target mass dependence of Drell-Yan production in upcoming proton-induced collisions at SPS and FAIR.</description>

      <title>The effect of three-body nucleon-nucleon interaction on the ground state binding energy of the light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the ground state binding energies of the light nuclei such as 4He, 6Li, 12C and 14N by considering the effect of three-body nucleon-nucleon interaction. We use the effective twobody potential obtained from the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) calculations of the nuclear matter for the Reid68, AV14, UV14, and AV18 nuclear potentials in different channels. To calculate the ground state binding energy, we implement the local density approximation by using the harmonic oscillator wave functions while the effect of three-body interaction is considered by employing the UIX potential. We compare the obtained two-body ground state binding energy with the energy related to the three-body effect. We also compare the obtained values with the experimental data and also work of others, and show that the results are relatively acceptable. We compute the root mean-square radius Rrms of the above nuclei for the Reid68, AV14, UV14, and AV18 potentials and compare the results with the experiment. We also obtain the contribution of different channels by matching to the experimental values of the quadrupole moments and magnetic dipole moments. Furthermore, we calculate the three-body cluster energy of the above nuclei and compare the results with that of nuclear matter. According to the obtained results, we see that the three-body cluster energy contribution is small. For example, for 4He nuclide, this value is 0.079 MeV with the Reid68 potential.</description>

      <title>Effect of potential-energy-model inaccuracies on predictions of fission-fragment mass distributions based on the Brownian shape-motion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moller and Randrup presented a comprehensive calculation, based on the Brownian shape motion (BSM) method, of fission-fragment charge distributions [Phys. Rev. C 91 (2015) 044316 ] which obtained that ``a new region of asymmetry'' appeared for approximately $95 \le N \le 115$ and $ 75 \le Z \le 94 $. Available experimental results at the time, except for the observation of symmetric fission of $^{187}$Ir by Itkis et al. [Yad. Fiz. 52 (1990) 944], agreed with these predictions apart for minor differences in the transition regions between predicted symmetric and asymmetric fission. It was argued [Phys. Rev. C 91 (2015) 044316 ] that the inaccurate results for $^{187}$Ir were related to inaccuracies in the calculated potential-energy surface and that such inaccuracies are related to the (in)accuracies of the calculated ground-state masses for the corresponding mass splits. We present here more detailed discussions and investigate if differences between the fission-fragment mass yields presented in [Phys. Rev. C 91 (2015) 044316 ] and experiment can occur in other regions of fissioning nuclei.</description>

      <title>Pauli Blocking effects in Nilsson states of weakly bound exotic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of weakly bound nuclei using deformed few-body models has proven to be crucial in the study of reactions involving certain exotic nuclei. However, these core+valence models face the challenge of applying the Pauli exclusion principle, since the factorisation of the system does not allow complete antisymmetrization. Therefore, states occupied by core nucleons should be blocked for the valence nucleons. We aim to study $^{17}$C and $^{19}$C, which are good examples of weakly bound exotic nuclei with significant deformation where the valence shell is partially filled. The structure of $^{17}$C and $^{19}$C is described with deformed two-body models where a Nilsson Hamiltonian is constructed using Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamic calculations of the cores. Different methods of blocking occupied Nilsson states are considered using the Bardeen$-$Cooper$-$Schrieffer formalism: without blocking, total blocking and partial blocking. The latter also takes into account pair correlations to some extent. These models are later used to study $^{16}$C$(d,p)^{17}$C, $^{17}$C$(p,d)^{16}$C and $^{18}$C$(d,p)^{19}$C transfer reactions within the Adiabatic Distorted Wave Approximation. In the first case, the results are compared with experimental data. A good reproduction of the structure of $^{17}$C is found, significantly improving the agreement in the $^{16}$C$(d,p)^{17}$C reaction including blocking effects. The $^{19}$C spectrum is better reproduced considering blocking, in particular, the partial blocking method that considers the pairing interaction provides the best description. Promising results are shown for the study of transfer reactions involving weakly bound exotic nuclei, by highlighting the effect of blocking occupied Nilsson states. We envision to extend the models to the study of breakup reactions and to newly discovered halo nuclei.</description>

      <title>Robust treatment of finite nuclear size reduces CKM unitarity deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. We show that the dependence of the decay rate of $^{26m}$Al on its charge radius is 4 times greater than previously believed, so it must be determined with high precision. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a highly different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test microscopic global optical potential in three-body calculations of deuteron-nucleus scattering. We solve Faddeev-type equations for three-body transition operators. We calculate differential cross section and analyzing power for the deuteron elastic scattering and breakup in collisions with ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{16}$O and ${}^{24}$Mg nuclei, and find a reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Comparison with respective predictions using phenomenological optical potentials reveals systematic deviations in particular kinematic regimes.</description>

      <title>Comment on "QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make several comments on the recent work in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} while also reaffirming and adding to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. We show that the factorization formula for $e^+e^-\to (h_1\cdots h_n)\, X$ in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} is equivalent to a version one can derive using the definition of a $n$-hadron fragmentation function (FF) introduced in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. In addition, we scrutinize how to generalize the number density definition of a single-hadron FF to a $n$-hadron FF, arguing that the definition given in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} should be considered the standard one. We also emphasize that the evolution equations for dihadron FFs~(DiFFs) in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have the same splitting functions as those for single-hadron FFs. Therefore, the DiFF (and $n$-hadron FF) definitions in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have a natural number density interpretation and are consistent with collinear factorization using the standard hard factors and evolution kernels. Moreover, we make clear that the operator definition for the DiFF $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ written down in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} agrees exactly with the one in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. Contrary to what is implied in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb}, this definition did not appear in the literature prior to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. There also seem to be inconsistencies in how $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ appears in previous unpolarized cross section formulas in the literature.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in color superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors and the Proton Radius Puzzle: A Critical Review of Extraction Methods via Electron-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of protons, fundamental constituents of atomic nuclei, is crucial for understanding nuclear physics and fundamental forces. This review examines advancements in extracting electromagnetic form factors, essential for probing proton structure. Electron-proton scattering experiments, particularly at Jefferson Lab (JLab) and Mainz Microtron (MAMI), have played a key role [arXiv:2009.10510, arXiv:1912.03881].
  Various methodologies, such as Rosenbluth separation and polarization transfer, are discussed, highlighting their evolution and challenges, including systematic uncertainties and theoretical ambiguities [arXiv:1706.00696]. Literature indicates the Rosenbluth method yields a proton radius of approximately 0.8 fm, consistent with early measurements but differing from recent polarization transfer results, which suggest a smaller radius [arXiv:1912.03881].
  The polarization transfer technique has become a preferred approach, offering precise measurements of the electric-to-magnetic form factor ratio, especially at high momentum transfer [arXiv:1706.00696, arXiv:1912.03881]. Alternative methods, such as cross-section ratios, extend form factor studies but still face residual uncertainties [arXiv:2009.10510].
  While significant progress has been made, discrepancies persist, particularly in proton radius extraction. Future research must address systematic uncertainties to refine our understanding of proton electromagnetic properties and advance particle physics [arXiv:1912.03881, arXiv:1706.00696].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of this uncertainty using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the local longitudinal scaling behavior of the dilute Glasma. We gain insight into how the fragmentation region is dominated by the longitudinal structure of one of the two colliding nuclei in heavy-ion collisions and study the effect of the correlation scales of the nuclear color charge distributions. We compare with results from the full dilute Glasma framework and analyze the rapidity limits of the fragmentation region. From our findings, it follows that all scalar observables that can be constructed out of the dilute Glasma field strength tensor show limiting fragmentation behavior and the field strength tensor itself transforms locally via Lorentz boosts when changing the collision energy.</description>

      <title>Proton spin from small-$x$ with constraints from the valence quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the valence quark model recently calculated for polarized proton to constrain the non-perturbative initial condition for the small-$x$ helicity evolution. The remaining free parameters are constrained by performing a global analysis to the available polarized small-$x$ deep inelastic scattering data. A good description of the world data is obtained with only 8 free parameters. The model parameters are tightly constrained by the data, allowing us to predict the proton polarized structure function $g_1^p$ to be negative at small $x$. Furthermore, we obtain the small-$x$ quark and gluon spins to give a contribution $\int_{10^{-5}}^{0.1} dx \left( \frac{1}{2}\Delta\Sigma + \Delta G \right) = 0.76 \pm 0.13$ or $1.70\pm 0.20$ to the proton spin, depending on the applied running coupling prescription.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Quantitative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties, focusing on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Using two-fluid and single-fluid models, dark matter is incorporated into the equation of state (EOS) via a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach. The study finds that increasing dark matter content reduces the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Bayesian inference, supported by LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave data and NICER mass-radius measurements, refines these models. Despite dark matter's influence, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains valid. Machine learning techniques effectively classify dark matter-admixed neutron stars. The thesis also explores a sigma-cut potential in the EOS, which stiffens the EOS at high densities, favoring larger radii and lower f-mode frequencies. The study of non-radial oscillations, particularly f- and p-modes, highlights their sensitivity to neutron star composition and EOS. These findings enhance our understanding of neutron star interiors and dark matter's role, emphasizing the need for further observational and theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the $G$(3900) quantum numbers $J^{PC}$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII observation of exotic hadron $G$(3900) [PRL 133(2024)081901] and by the study presented in a recent paper [PRL 133(2024)241903] where $G$(3900) was identified as a $P$-wave $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ resonance, we use the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE to simulate the $G$(3900) production in $e^+e^-$ annihilations at $\sqrt s$=4.95 GeV. The $G$(3900) candidates are recombined by Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model using component mesons of $D\bar D$ or $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ in the PACIAE simulated final hadronic state. We then calculate the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame for the first time and perform the spectral classification for each of the above $G$(3900) candidates. Our results confirm the BESIII observation of $G$(3900) in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D^0\bar D^0/ D^+D^-$ processes and suggest that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D$ is $D$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$. Moreover, our results indicate that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ is $P$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=$ $0^{-+}$, $1^{-+}$ or $2^{-+}$, which is consistent with the conclusion in PRL 133(2024)241903. Finally, significant discrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the $G$(3900) $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave states are observed. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria for deciphering the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number and $J^{PC}$.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential. In this article we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of Hardon Resonance Gas (HRG) models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of bound states of antiprotons in close proximity to the atomic nucleus. Using experimental data from X-ray spectroscopy measurements of antiprotonic atom transitions, we tune a minimal theoretical framework and estimate parameter ranges where the strong or electromagnetic decay channels govern the stability of the deepest bound states. In this way, we present an overview of the dominant decay mechanism of antiprotonic orbits for a given principle quantum number, which may be useful for future spectroscopic experiments on antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>Studying Effects of Evolution on Charge Separation in Small Collision System with A MultiPhase Transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic high energy heavy-ion collisions, Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) could produce a charge separation in QGP. The charge separation could survive into final hadron system during evolution, observed as correlator $\Delta\gamma$. This physics procedure could also occurs in small collision system if CME emerge in the QGP droplet. In this paper, we study the effects of QGP droplet evolution on charge separation in small collision system, based on AMPT model. Our calculation indicates that, with given initial charge separation, the effects of parton level evolution and hadron level evolution weaken the charge separation indeed, but there is still enough signals could remained. Furthermore, we found that, the contribution of background to $\Delta\gamma$ is negligible in small collision system. So, we propose the small collision system being a good place to confirm contribution of CME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the space-time evolution of electromagnetic fields along with the azimuthal fluctuations of these fields and their correlation with the initial matter geometry specified by the participant plane in the presence of finite electric $\left(\sigma\right)$ and chiral magnetic $\left(\sigma_{\chi}\right)$ conductivities in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We observe the partially asymmetric behavior of the spatial distributions of the electric and magnetic fields in a conducting medium when compared to the Lienard-Wiechert (L-W) solutions, and deceleration of the decay of the fields is observed in both isobar collisions. While studying the correlation between the magnetic field direction and the participant plane, we see the sizeable suppression of the correlation in the presence of finite conductivities when compared to the L-W case, reflecting the importance of taking into account the medium properties such as conductivities while calculating the magnetic field induced observable quantities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing puzzle of the quenched $g_A$ in nuclei is shown to have an extremely simple resolution in a renormalization-group (RG) treatment of a hidden local symmetric (HLS) and scale-symmetric (HSS) chiral Lagrangian. It is shown that the Landau-Migdal fixed-point approximation in nuclear matter (or $V_{lowk}$ in finite nuclei) in RG approach to strong correlations of fermionic hadrons on the Fermi surface {\it exactly} reproduces the superallowed Gamow-Teller transitions in the ``Extreme Single-Particle (shell-)Model (ESPM)" in doubly-magic closed shell nuclei. One arrives at the quenching factor $q\approx 0.78$ giving the quenched $g_A^{\rm eff} \approx 1$. This resolution exposes scale-chiral symmetry, hidden in QCD in the vacuum, emerging in nuclear matter from low density to high compact-star density. It has important implications on ``first principles" approaches to nuclear physics, such as the role of multi-body exchange currents in weak axial-current matrix elements in nuclei and in neutrinoless double $\beta$ decays for going Beyond the Standard Model. This resolution could put in serious doubt the most recent improved measurement of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic closed shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn which if confirmed would require a ``{\it fundamental quenching}" $q_{ssb}\sim 1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive a relativistic canonical-like second-order spin hydrodynamics for two power-counting schemes. We obtain comprehensive second-order expressions for dissipative fluxes, including the shear stress tensor, bulk viscous pressure, charge-diffusion currents, rotational stress tensor, boost heat vector, and spin tensor-related dissipative flux. By introducing novel transport coefficients and expressing them in terms of equilibrium correlation functions, we establish new Kubo-type formulas for second-order transport. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the collective spin dynamics of strongly interacting matter and provide a robust theoretical basis for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in quenched and (2+1)-flavor QCD on a 4-D Euclidean lattice. The light-like propagation of an energetic parton is factorized from the mean square gain in momentum transverse to the direction of propagation, which is expressed in terms of the thermal field-strength field-strength correlator. The leading-twist term in its operator product expansion is calculated on the lattice. Continuum extrapolated quenched results, and full QCD estimates based on un-renormalized lattice data, over multiple lattice sizes, are compared with (non) perturbative calculations and phenomenological extractions of $\hat{q}$. The lattice data for $\hat{q}$ show a temperature dependence similar to the entropy density. Within uncertainties, these are consistent with phenomenological extractions, contrary to calculations using perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-forward eikonal scattering matrix for dipole-proton scattering at high energy obtains an imaginary part due to a $C$-odd three gluon exchange. We present numerical estimates for the perturbative Odderon amplitude as a function of dipole size, impact parameter, their relative azimuthal angle, and light-cone momentum cutoff $x$. The proton is approximated as $\psi_\mathrm{qqq}|qqq\rangle + \psi_\mathrm{qqqg}|qqqg\rangle$, where $\psi_\mathrm{qqq}$ is a non-perturbative three quark model wave function while the gluon emission is computed in light-cone perturbation theory. We find that the Odderon amplitude increases as $x$ decreases from 0.1 to 0.01. At yet lower $x$, the reversal of this energy dependence would reflect the onset of universal small-$x$ renormalization group evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of isolated three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation at rotation in magnetic field, electric and scalar potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM Collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing toward a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions III: coupled-channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal} that connects integrated correlation function of a trapped two-particle system to infinite volume scattering phase shift is further extended to coupled-channel systems in the present work. Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as an example, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in the single channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in both channels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactly solvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. It is further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of a quasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. In all cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trap size is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidate to overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.</description>

      <title>Bottomoniumlike states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomoniumlike" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <title>Weak nuclear decays deep-underground as a probe of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

      <title>Mixing interactions and effects in the NJL-model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flavor-dependent quark-antiquark contact interactions, induced by vacuum polarization and recently derived for flavor U(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, are articulated with the resulting mixing effects emerging from flavor symmetry breaking in view. The formal effects of the explicit mixing interactions, $G_{i\neq j}$, are detailed firstly for the meson mixing problem without the inclusion of 't Hooft interactions induced by instantons. Secondly, it is shown that these mixings, in the scalar channel of quark-antiquark interactions, might give rise to quark mixing in the gap equations. Sixth order quark-antiquark interactions from vacuum polarization, that break $U_A(1)$ symmetry, also contribute.</description>
