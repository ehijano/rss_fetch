      <title>DESI 2024 III: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Galaxies and Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the DESI 2024 galaxy and quasar baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements using over 5.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1. Divided by tracer type, we utilize 300,017 galaxies from the magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey with 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4, 2,138,600 Luminous Red Galaxies with 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.1, 2,432,022 Emission Line Galaxies with 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6, and 856,652 quasars with 0.8&lt;z&lt;2.1, over a ~7,500 square degree footprint. The analysis was blinded at the catalog-level to avoid confirmation bias. All fiducial choices of the BAO fitting and reconstruction methodology, as well as the size of the systematic errors, were determined on the basis of the tests with mock catalogs and the blinded data catalogs. We present several improvements to the BAO analysis pipeline, including enhancing the BAO fitting and reconstruction methods in a more physically-motivated direction, and also present results using combinations of tracers. We present a re-analysis of SDSS BOSS and eBOSS results applying the improved DESI methodology and find scatter consistent with the level of the quoted SDSS theoretical systematic uncertainties. With the total effective survey volume of ~ 18 Gpc$^3$, the combined precision of the BAO measurements across the six different redshift bins is ~0.52%, marking a 1.2-fold improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results using only first-year data. We detect the BAO in all of these six redshift bins. The highest significance of BAO detection is $9.1\sigma$ at the effective redshift of 0.93, with a constraint of 0.86% placed on the BAO scale. We find our measurements are systematically larger than the prediction of Planck-2018 LCDM model at z&lt;0.8. We translate the results into transverse comoving distance and radial Hubble distance measurements, which are used to constrain cosmological models in our companion paper [abridged].</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 IV: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Lyman Alpha Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest of high-redshift quasars with the first-year dataset of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis uses over $420\,000$ Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra and their correlation with the spatial distribution of more than $700\,000$ quasars. An essential facet of this work is the development of a new analysis methodology on a blinded dataset. We conducted rigorous tests using synthetic data to ensure the reliability of our methodology and findings before unblinding. Additionally, we conducted multiple data splits to assess the consistency of the results and scrutinized various analysis approaches to confirm their robustness. For a given value of the sound horizon ($r_d$), we measure the expansion at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$ with 2\% precision, $H(z_{\rm eff}) = (239.2 \pm 4.8) (147.09~{\rm Mpc} /r_d)$ km/s/Mpc. Similarly, we present a 2.4\% measurement of the transverse comoving distance to the same redshift, $D_M(z_{\rm eff}) = (5.84 \pm 0.14) (r_d/147.09~{\rm Mpc})$ Gpc. Together with other DESI BAO measurements at lower redshifts, these results are used in a companion paper to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 VI: Cosmological Constraints from the Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;4.2$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with a matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.295\pm 0.015$. Paired with a BBN prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the CMB, DESI requires $H_0=(68.52\pm0.62)$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.307\pm 0.005$ and $H_0=(67.97\pm0.38)$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, DESI BAO alone require $w=-0.99^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with SN~Ia individually prefer $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. This preference is 2.6$\sigma$ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN~Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the $2.5\sigma$, $3.5\sigma$ or $3.9\sigma$ levels for the addition of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072$ $(0.113)$ eV at 95% confidence for a $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ $(\sum m_\nu&gt;0.059)$ eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. [Abridged.]</description>

      <title>Characterization of contaminants in the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations can be measured with sub-percent precision above redshift two with the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. This is one of the key goals of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which started its main survey in May 2021. We present in this paper a study of the contaminants to the lyman-alpha forest which are mainly caused by correlated signals introduced by the spectroscopic data processing pipeline as well as astrophysical contaminants due to foreground absorption in the intergalactic medium. Notably, an excess signal caused by the sky background subtraction noise is present in the lyman-alpha auto-correlation in the first line-of-sight separation bin. We use synthetic data to isolate this contribution, we also characterize the effect of spectro-photometric calibration noise, and propose a simple model to account for both effects in the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest. We then measure the auto-correlation of the quasar flux transmission fraction of low redshift quasars, where there is no lyman-alpha forest absorption but only its contaminants. We demonstrate that we can interpret the data with a two-component model: data processing noise and triply ionized Silicon and Carbon auto-correlations. This result can be used to improve the modeling of the lyman-alpha auto-correlation function measured with DESI.</description>

      <title>Validation of the DESI 2024 Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO analysis using synthetic datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) contains the largest set of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest spectra ever observed. This data, collected in the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) sample, has been used to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature at redshift $z=2.33$. In this work, we use a set of 150 synthetic realizations of DESI DR1 to validate the DESI 2024 Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO measurement. The synthetic data sets are based on Gaussian random fields using the log-normal approximation. We produce realistic synthetic DESI spectra that include all major contaminants affecting the Ly$\alpha$ forest. The synthetic data sets span a redshift range $1.8&lt;z&lt;3.8$, and are analysed using the same framework and pipeline used for the DESI 2024 Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO measurement. To measure BAO, we use both the Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. We use the mean of correlation functions from the set of DESI DR1 realizations to show that our model is able to recover unbiased measurements of the BAO position. We also fit each mock individually and study the population of BAO fits in order to validate BAO uncertainties and test our method for estimating the covariance matrix of the Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation functions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results and identify the needs for the next generation of Ly$\alpha$ forest synthetic data sets, with the top priority being to simulate the effect of BAO broadening due to non-linear evolution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reconstruction of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations for DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler to measure the expansion history of the Universe through galaxy clustering. Density-field reconstruction is now a widely adopted procedure for increasing the precision and accuracy of the BAO detection. With the goal of finding the optimal reconstruction settings to be used in the DESI 2024 galaxy BAO analysis, we assess the sensitivity of the post-reconstruction BAO constraints to different choices in our analysis configuration, performing tests on blinded data from the first year of DESI observations (DR1), as well as on mocks that mimic the expected clustering and selection properties of the DESI DR1 target samples. Overall, we find that BAO constraints remain robust against multiple aspects in the reconstruction process, including the choice of smoothing scale, treatment of redshift-space distortions, fiber assignment incompleteness, and parameterizations of the BAO model. We also present a series of tests that DESI followed in order to assess the maturity of the end-to-end galaxy BAO pipeline before the unblinding of the large-scale structure catalogs.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilitites, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;~ 5% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, in particular, relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>HOD-Dependent Systematics for Luminous Red Galaxies in the DESI 2024 BAO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the estimation of systematics related to the halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) distance measurement of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 analysis. This paper focuses on the study of HOD systematics for luminous red galaxies (LRG). We consider three different HOD models for LRGs, including the base 5-parameter vanilla model and two extensions to it, that we refer to as baseline and extended models. The baseline model is described by the 5 vanilla HOD parameters, an incompleteness factor and a velocity bias parameter, whereas the extended one also includes a galaxy assembly bias and a satellite profile parameter. We utilize the 25 dark matter simulations available in the AbacusSummit simulation suite at $z=$ 0.8 and generate mock catalogs for our different HOD models. To test the impact of the HOD modeling in the position of the BAO peak, we run BAO fits for all these sets of simulations and compare the best-fit BAO-scaling parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ between every pair of HOD models. We do this for both Fourier and configuration spaces independently, using post-reconstruction measurements. We find a 3.3$\sigma$ detection of HOD systematic for $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ in configuration space with an amplitude of 0.19%. For the other cases, we did not find a 3$\sigma$ detection, and we decided to compute a conservative estimation of the systematic using the ensemble of shifts between all pairs of HOD models. By doing this, we quote a systematic with an amplitude of 0.07% in $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ for both Fourier and configuration spaces; and of 0.09% in $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ for Fourier space.</description>

      <title>HOD-Dependent Systematics in Emission Line Galaxies for the DESI 2024 BAO analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide precise measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to constrain the expansion history of the Universe and set stringent constraints on dark energy. Therefore, precise control of the global error budget due to various systematic effects is required for the DESI 2024 BAO analysis. In this work, we focus on the robustness of the BAO analysis against the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling for the Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) tracer. Based on a common dark matter simulation, our analysis relies on HOD mocks tuned to early DESI data, namely the One-Percent survey data. To build the mocks, we use several HOD models for the ELG tracer as well as extensions to the baseline HOD models. Among these extensions, we consider distinct recipes for galactic conformity and assembly bias. We perform two independent analyses in the Fourier space and in the configuration space. We recover the BAO signal from two-point measurements after performing reconstruction on our mocks. Additionally, we also apply the control variates technique to reduce sample variance noise. Our BAO analysis can recover the isotropic BAO parameter $\alpha_\text{iso}$ within 0.1\% and the Alcock Paczynski parameter $\alpha_\text{AP}$ within 0.3\%. Overall, we find that our systematic error due to the HOD dependence is below 0.17\%, with the Fourier space analysis being more robust against the HOD systematics. We conclude that our analysis pipeline is robust enough against the HOD systematics for the ELG tracer in the DESI 2024 BAO analysis.</description>

      <title>Suppressing the sample variance of DESI-like galaxy clustering with fast simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing and upcoming galaxy redshift surveys, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, will observe vast regions of sky and a wide range of redshifts. In order to model the observations and address various systematic uncertainties, $N$-body simulations are routinely adopted, however, the number of large simulations with sufficiently high mass resolution is usually limited by available computing time. Therefore, achieving a simulation volume with the effective statistical errors significantly smaller than those of the observations becomes prohibitively expensive. In this study, we apply the Convergence Acceleration by Regression and Pooling (CARPool) method to mitigate the sample variance of the DESI-like galaxy clustering in the AbacusSummit simulations, with the assistance of the quasi-$N$-body simulations FastPM. Based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models, we construct different FastPM galaxy catalogs, including the luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars, with their number densities and two-point clustering statistics well matched to those of AbacusSummit. We also employ the same initial conditions between AbacusSummit and FastPM to achieve high cross-correlation, as it is useful in effectively suppressing the variance. Our method of reducing noise in clustering is equivalent to performing a simulation with volume larger by a factor of 5 and 4 for LRGs and ELGs, respectively. We also mitigate the standard deviation of the LRG bispectrum with the triangular configurations $k_2=2k_1=0.2\hMpc$ by a factor of 1.6. With smaller sample variance on galaxy clustering, we are able to constrain the BAO scale parameters to higher precision. The CARPool method will be beneficial to better constrain the theoretical systematics of BAO, redshift space distortions (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant using DESI emission-line galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present strong constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In this pilot work, we utilize $\sim110,000$ galaxies with strong and narrow O III $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines to measure the relative variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in space and time. The O III doublet is arguably the best choice for this purpose owing to its wide wavelength separation between the two lines and its strong emission in many galaxies. Our galaxy sample spans a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.95$, covering half of all cosmic time. We divide the sample into subsamples in 10 redshift bins ($\Delta z=0.1$), and calculate $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ for the individual subsamples. The uncertainties of the measured $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ are roughly between $2\times10^{-6}$ and $2\times10^{-5}$. We find an apparent $\alpha$ variation with redshift at a level of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=(2\sim3)\times10^{-5}$. This is highly likely to be caused by systematics associated with wavelength calibration, since such small systematics can be caused by a wavelength distortion of $0.002-0.003$ \AA, which is beyond the accuracy that the current DESI data can achieve. We refine the wavelength calibration using sky lines for a small fraction of the galaxies, but it does not change our main results. We further probe the spatial variation of $\alpha$ in small redshift ranges, and do not find obvious, large-scale structures in the spatial distribution of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. As DESI is ongoing, we will include more galaxies, and by improving the wavelength calibration, we expect to obtain a better constraint that is comparable to the strongest current constraint.</description>

      <title>A model for galaxy-galaxy strong lensing statistics in surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric wide-area observations in the next decade will be capable of detecting a large number of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, increasing the gravitational lens sample size by orders of magnitude. To aid in forecasting and analysis of these surveys, we construct a flexible model based on observed distributions for the lens and source properties and test it on the results of past lens searches, including SL2S, SuGOHI and searches on the COSMOS HST and DES fields. We use this model to estimate the expected yields of some current and planned surveys, including Euclid Wide, Vera Rubin LSST, and Roman High Latitude Wide Area. The model proposed includes a set of free parameters to constrain on the identifiability of a lens in an image, allowing construction of prior probability distributions for different lens detection methods. The code used in this work is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent local primordial non-Gaussianity as a solution to the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the last decade, several probes have pointed to a cosmological tension between the amplitude of density fluctuations extrapolated from the cosmic microwave background within the standard cosmological model and the one encapsulated by the $S_8$ parameter from large scale structure. The origin of this $S_8$ tension has not yet been elucidated and may hint at systematics in the data, unaccounted effects from baryonic physics, or new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. Baryonic physics may in principle provide a nonlinear solution to the tension by suppressing the matter power spectrum more strongly on nonlinear scales than is traditionally assumed. Such a solution would not worsen the Hubble tension, contrary to many other proposed solutions to the $S_8$ tension. However, no realistic baryonic feedback in hydrodynamical simulations provides the needed suppression as a function of redshift. Here, we point out that a scale-dependence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), with significant PNG at scales of a few Mpc, can provide the needed suppression, since such PNG can suppress the power spectrum at slightly larger scales than baryons do. We demonstrate this by devising collisionless numerical simulations of structure formation in boxes of 0.5 Gpc/h with scale-dependent local-type PNG. Our simple models show that, as a proof of principle, scale-dependent PNG, with a Gaussian random field for primodial density fluctuations on large scales and $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -300$ at $\lesssim 10$ Mpc scales, together with state-of-the-art baryonification of the matter power spectrum, can in principle solve the $S_8$ tension. The $S_8$ tension would then be a smoking-gun of non-trivial inflationary physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute $3.54^{+7.66}_{-2.82}\times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce an innovative parametric representation of the Hubble parameter, providing a model-independent means to explore the dynamics of an accelerating cosmos. The model's parameters are rigorously constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, leveraging a comprehensive dataset consisting of 31 data points from cosmic chronometers (CC), 1701 updated observations of Pantheon supernovae type Ia (SNeIa), and 6 data points from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Our analysis delves into the behavior of various cosmological parameters within the model, including the transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one, as well as the density parameters and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The outcomes of our investigation reveal that the equation of state parameter aligns with characteristics reminiscent of the phantom model, supporting the prevailing understanding of our universe's current state of acceleration. This research contributes valuable insights into the ongoing cosmic expansion and underscores the utility of our novel parametric approach.</description>

      <title>3D scaling laws and projection effects in The300-NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zeldovich Large Program Twin Samples</title>

Abstract: The abundance of galaxy clusters with mass and redshift is a well-known cosmological probe. The cluster mass is a key parameter for studies that aim to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters, making it critical to understand and properly account for the errors in its estimates. Subsequently, it becomes important to correctly calibrate scaling relations between observables like the integrated Compton parameter and the mass of the cluster.
  The NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zeldovich Large program (LPSZ) enables one to map the intracluster medium profiles in the mm-wavelength band with great details (resolution of $11 \ \mathrm{\&amp;}\ 17^{\prime \prime}$ at $1.2 \ \mathrm{\&amp;}\ 2 $ mm, respectively) and hence, to estimate the cluster hydrostatic mass more precisely than previous SZ observations. However, there are certain systematic effects which can only be accounted for with the use of simulations. For this purpose, we employ THE THREE HUNDRED simulations which have been modelled with a range of physics modules to simulate galaxy clusters. The so-called twin samples are constructed by picking synthetic clusters of galaxies with properties close to the observational targets of the LPSZ. In particular, we use the Compton parameter maps and projected total mass maps of these twin samples along 29 different lines of sight. We investigate the scatter that projection induces on the total masses. Eventually, we consider the statistical values along different lines of sight to construct a kind of 3D scaling law between the integrated Compton parameter, total mass, and overdensity of the galaxy clusters to determine the overdensity that is least impacted by the projection effect.</description>

      <title>Signal-preserving CMB component separation with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.</description>

      <title>High redshift LBGs from deep broadband imaging for future spectroscopic surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are promising probes for clustering measurements at high redshift, $z&gt;2$, a region only covered so far by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of selecting LBGs by exploiting the existence of a strong deficit of flux shortward of the Lyman limit, due to various absorption processes along the line of sight. The target selection relies on deep imaging data from the HSC and CLAUDS surveys in the $g,r,z$ and $u$ bands, respectively, with median depths reaching 27 AB in all bands. The selections were validated by several dedicated spectroscopic observation campaigns with DESI. Visual inspection of spectra has enabled us to develop an automated spectroscopic typing and redshift estimation algorithm specific to LBGs. Based on these data and tools, we assess the efficiency and purity of target selections optimised for different purposes. Selections providing a wide redshift coverage retain $57\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI, and provide an efficiency for LBGs of $83\pm3\%$, for a purity of the selected LBG sample of $90\pm2\%$. This would deliver a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 620$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.2$. Selections optimised for high redshift efficiency retain $73\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation, with $89\pm4\%$ efficiency for $97\pm2\%$ purity. This would provide a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 470$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.8&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.5$. A preliminary study of the LBG sample 3d-clustering properties is also presented and used to estimate the LBG linear bias. A value of $b_{LBG} = 3.3 \pm 0.2 (stat.)$ is obtained for a mean redshift of 2.9 and a limiting magnitude in $r$ of 24.2, in agreement with results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields from small-scale primordial perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields must have existed in the early Universe, as they were sourced by the cross product of electron density and temperature gradients through the Biermann-battery mechanism. In this paper we calculate the magnetic fields generated at cosmic dawn by a variety of small-scale primordial perturbations, carefully computing the evolution of electron density and temperature fluctuations, and consistently accounting for relative velocities between baryons and dark matter. We first compute the magnetic field resulting from standard, nearly scale-invariant primordial adiabatic perturbations, making significant improvements to previous calculations. This "standard" primordial field has a root mean square (rms) of $\sim10^{-15}$ nG at $20\lesssim z \lesssim 100$, with fluctuations on $\sim$ kpc comoving scales, and could serve as the seed of present-day magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition, we consider early-Universe magnetic fields as a possible probe of non-standard initial conditions of the Universe on small scales $k \sim 1-10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To this end, we compute the maximally-allowed magnetic fields within current upper limits on small-scale adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. Under the current Cosmic Microwave Background spectral-distortion constraints magnetic fields could be produced with a rms of $\sim 5\times 10^{-11}$ nG at $z = 20$. Uncorrelated small-scale isocurvature perturbations within current Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds could potentially enhance the magnetic field to $\sim 10^{-14}-10^{-10}$ nG at $z = 20$, depending on the specific isocurvature mode considered. While these very weak fields remain well below current observational capabilities, our work points out that magnetic fields could potentially provide an interesting window into the poorly constrained small-scale initial conditions of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the non-linear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a three-dimensional mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the descent via membrane nucleation through a landscape of vacua where the cosmological constant is given by a combination of four-form fluxes. It has been shown that this descent can be slowed exponentially for very low curvature vacua close to Minkowski space in a wide class of models satisfying certain parametric conditions, providing a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. We explore in detail whether or not those parametric conditions are compatible with the membrane weak gravity conjecture. Whilst it is true that there is often tension, we show that this is not always the case and present an explicit model where Minkowski space is absolutely stable and the weak gravity conjecture is satisfied. This corresponds to an extension of the Bousso-Polchinski model into a generalised DBI action for four-forms. We also clarify how the landscape should be populated in a consistent model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible extension of the Standard Model able to explain the recent measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon consists in adding a gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry. If the dark matter particle is charged under this symmetry, the kinetic mixing between the new gauge boson and the photon induces dark matter-electron interactions. We derive direct detection constraints on light dark matter charged under a $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry with electron recoil experiments, and explore prospects with XLZD and OSCURA to close in the parameter space able to explain simultaneously the recent measurement on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the observed relic density of dark matter. We further discuss the spin-dependent scattering contribution arising in this model, which was ignored previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>A complex node of the cosmic web associated with the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0600.1-2008</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MACS J0600.1-2008 (MACS0600) is an X-ray luminous, massive galaxy cluster at $z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.43$, studied previously as part of the REionization LensIng Cluster Survey (RELICS) and ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) projects which revealed a complex, bimodal mass distribution and an intriguing high-redshift object behind it. Here, we report on the results of an extended strong-lensing (SL) analysis of this system. Using new JWST and ground-based Gemini-N and Keck data, we obtain 13 new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies and identify 12 new photometric multiple-image systems and candidates, including two multiply imaged $z\sim7$ objects. Taking advantage of the larger areal coverage, our analysis reveals a new bimodal, massive SL structure adjacent to the cluster which we measure spectroscopically to lie at the same redshift and whose existence was implied by previous SL-modeling analyses. While based in part on photometric systems identified in ground-based imaging requiring further verification, our extended SL model suggests that the cluster may have the second-largest critical area and effective Einstein radius observed to date, $A_{\mathrm{crit}}\simeq2.16\,\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}=49.7''\pm5.0''$ for a source at $z_{\mathrm{s}}=2$, enclosing a total mass of $M(&lt;\theta_{\mathrm{E}})=(4.7\pm0.7)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Yet another, probably related massive cluster structure, discovered in X-rays $5'$ (1.7 Mpc) further north, suggests that MACS0600 is in fact part of an even larger filamentary structure. This discovery adds to several recent detections of massive structures around SL galaxy clusters and establishes MACS0600 as a prime target for future high-redshift surveys with JWST.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetry Breaking and Gravitational Waves : A Tale of Two Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05829v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study possible ways gravitational waves (GW) are sourced in a theory with minimal left-right symmetry breaking. Generically first order phase transitions (FOPT) lead to gravitational waves sourced by bubble collisions, while second order phase transitions (SOPT) do not. However, due the presence of two degenerate fields, we obtain domain walls in the putative SOPT case, giving rise to GW via decaying domain walls, testable at experiments such as IPTA, DECIGO, and LISA. On the other hand, for the case of FOPT, we get the usual signal from spontaneously created bubbles, but also a late forming domain wall structure separating the two types of vacua. Thus the traditional FOPT case gives rise to two distinct peaks in the spectrum of GW, verifiable for the low symmetry breaking scales $10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, but beyond the reach of currently planned experiments for a high scale $\sim10^{10}$ GeV. Finally, we point out that a version of the left-right symmetric model which separates parity breaking from gauge symmetry breaking is also subject to domain wall formation and amenable to GW observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Microlensing on Gravitational Wave Signals: Biases, Population Characteristics, and Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of microlensing on gravitational wave (GW) signals in the LIGO$-$Virgo sensitivity band. Microlensing caused by an isolated point lens, with (redshifted) mass ranging from $M_\mathrm{Lz}\in(1,10^5){\rm M}_\odot$ and impact parameter $y\in (0.01,~5)$, can result in a maximum mismatch of $\sim 30\%$ with their unlensed counterparts. When $y&lt;1$, it strongly anti-correlates with the luminosity distance enhancing the detection horizon and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Biases in inferred source parameters are assessed, with in-plane spin components being the most affected intrinsic parameters. The luminosity distance is often underestimated, while sky-localisation and trigger times are mostly well-recovered. Study of a population of microlensed signals due to an isolated point lens primarily reveals: (i) using unlensed templates during the search causes fractional loss ($20\%$ to $30\%$) of potentially identifiable microlensed signals; (ii) the observed distribution of $y$ challenges the notion of its high improbability at low values ($y\lesssim 1$), especially for $y\lesssim 0.1$; (iii) Bayes factor analysis of the population indicates that certain region in $M_\mathrm{Lz}-y$ parameter space have a higher probability of being detected and accurately identified as microlensed. Notably, the microlens parameters for the most compelling candidate identified in previous microlensing searches, GW200208_130117, fall within a 1-sigma range of the aforementioned higher probability region. Identifying microlensing signatures from $M_\mathrm{Lz}&lt;100~$M$_\odot$ remains challenging due to small microlensing effects at typical SNR values. Additionally, we also examined how microlensing from a population of microlenses influences the detection of strong lensing signatures in pairs of GW events, particularly in the posterior-overlap analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantifying the Impact of Triaxiality on Optical Signatures of Galaxy Clusters: Weak Lensing and Galaxy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observational evidence of the impact of triaxiality on radial profiles that extend to 40 Mpc from galaxy cluster centres in optical measurements. We perform a stacked profile analysis from a sample of thousands of nearly relaxed galaxy clusters from public data releases of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). Using the central galaxy elliptical orientation angle as a proxy for galaxy cluster orientation, we measure cluster weak lensing and excess galaxy density axis-aligned profiles, extracted along the central galaxy's major or minor axes on the plane-of-the-sky. Our measurements show a $\gtrsim2-3\sigma$ difference per radial bin between the normalized axis-aligned profiles. The profile difference between each axis-aligned profile and the azimuthally averaged profile ($\sim\pm10-20\%$ along major/minor axis) appears inside the clusters ($\sim0.4$ Mpc) and extends to the large-scale structure regime ($\sim10-20$ Mpc). The magnitude of the difference appears to be relatively insensitive to cluster richness and redshift, and extends further out in the weak lensing surface mass density than in the galaxy overdensity. Looking forward, this measurement can easily be applied to other observational or simulation datasets and can inform the systematics in cluster mass modeling related to triaxiality. We expect imminent upcoming wide-area deep surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), to improve our quantification of optical signatures of cluster triaxiality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on modelling galaxy cluster gas profiles via a semi-parametric nodal approach. While traditional methods like the generalised Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) often encounter parameter degeneracy, our flexible node-based method precisely defines a cluster gas pressure profile. Using Planck space telescope data from the Coma region, our model, focused on the pressure-radius relationship, showcases enhanced flexibility over the gNFW. Bayesian analyses indicated an optimal five-node structure for the Coma cluster pressure profile.</description>

Abstract: Measurements with widefield radio interferometers often include the near-infinite gradient between the sky and the horizon. This causes aliasing inherent to the measurement itself, and is purely a consequence of the Fourier basis. For this reason, the horizon is often attenuated by the instrumental beam down to levels deemed inconsequential. However, this effect is enhanced via our own Galactic plane as it sets over the course of a night. We show all-sky simulations of the Galactic plane setting in a radio interferometer in detail for the first time. We then apply these simulations to the Murchison Widefield Array to show that a beam attenuation of 0.1% is not sufficient in some precision science cases. We determine that the noise statistics of the residual data image are drastically more Gaussian with aliasing removal, and explore consequences in simulation for cataloging of extragalactic sources and 21 cm Epoch of Reionization detection via the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using Bright Standard Sirens from ongoing and upcoming detectors</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new avenue to test Einstein's General Relativity (GR) using the ongoing and upcoming GW detectors by measuring the redshift evolution of the effective Planck mass proposed by several modified theories of gravity. We propose a model-independent, data-driven approach to measure any deviation from GR in the GW propagation effect by combining multi-messenger observations of GW sources accompanied by EM counterparts, commonly known as bright sirens (Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star Black Hole systems (NSBH)). We show that by combining the GW luminosity distance measurements from bright sirens with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering, and the sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven reconstruction of deviation of the variation of the effective Planck mass (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this technique, we achieve a precise measurement of GR with redshift (z) with a precision of approximately $7.9\%$ for BNSs at redshift z=0.075 and $10\%$ for NSBHs at redshift z=0.225 with 5 years of observation from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of detectors. Employing Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope for just 1 year yields the best precision of about $1.62\%$ for BNSs and $2\%$ for NSBHs at redshift z=0.5 on the evolution of the frictional term, and a similar precision up to z=1. This measurement can discover potential deviation from any kind of model that impacts GW propagation with ongoing and upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Perturbation Theory for Biased Tracers: Halo numbers are conserved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) provides a simple yet powerful way of computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and it has been applied to biased tracers such as halos and galaxies. The number conservation of matter particles allows a simple relation between the fluctuations at the initial and the late times, which is essential in deriving the exact expression for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. Here we explore the significance of the number conservation in the LPT. For example, biased tracers in contrast evolve through mergers and accretion, violating the assumption of number conservation. We use $N$-body simulations to demonstrate that if applied to halos at early time the LPT predictions for halos overestimates the power spectrum at $z=0$ by a factor of three for the mass bin sample $\Delta \log M_h~(h^{-1}M_{\odot})= 0.5$ at~$z\simeq 3$, while the predictions can be made consistent if we impose by hand the number conservation of halos in the simulations throughout the entire evolution. This numerical experiment proves that the number conservation is crucial in the LPT formalism. In reality, LPT modeling of biased tracers involves marginalization of unknown bias parameters, and the bias functional can represent a weight on the particles at initial time that make up today's halos, satisfying the number conservation. We discuss the implications for field-level models based on the LPT applications.</description>

      <title>Sound Horizon Independent Constraints on Early Dark Energy: The Role of Supernova Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the consistency of cosmological models that alter the size of the sound horizon at last scattering to resolve the Hubble tension with data from ACT + Planck CMB lensing, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and supernova data from Pantheon or Pantheon+. We use early dark energy (EDE) as an example model but conclude that the results apply to other similar models. We constrain $\Lambda$CDM and EDE with these data finding that while they can constrain $\Lambda$CDM very tightly, EDE opens up the parameter space significantly and allows $H_0 &gt; 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We combine these data with measurements from ACT + Planck TT650TEEE CMB primary anisotropy and galaxy baryon acoustic oscillations, and find that overall, EDE fits these data better than $\Lambda$CDM at $\approx 2\sigma$. However, the fit to specifically the sound-horizon-independent measurements is worse for EDE than $\Lambda$CDM. We assess this increase in $\chi^2$ coming from the sound-horizon-independent measurements and find that the best-fit model is still consistent with a random statistical fluctuation even with $H_0$ values around $72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that these specific sound-horizon-independent data cannot rule out the possibility of a miscalibration of the size of the sound horizon, but leave open the possibility that other current or future sound-horizon-independent data sets could rule out such a miscalibration.</description>

      <title>The effect of Relativistic Aberration on Cosmological Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: we propose that the condition of relative motion between us and the objects that we observe in the Universe should generate relativistic aberration on the photons that such objects emit, varying the observed flux similarly to the cases of blazars and neutron stars, with instead a decrease of this radiative flux. Methods: we follow some important papers and textbook used in modern cosmology, adding the effects of relativistic aberration in the theoretical description of the Cosmos. Results: New definitions for the luminosity distance and the angular distance arise, with the consequence of changing the cosmological parameters measured in the last years. A qualitative description of all of this is also performed on the multipole analysis of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Pantheon SNeIa data in the context of Barrow's variable speed of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.10292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Combined Pantheon Sample of Type Ia supernovae while allowing the velocity of light to vary as a function of the scale factor $c\propto a^{-\zeta}$, as initiated by Barrow [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. The variation in the velocity of light creates an effect akin to the refraction phenomenon which occurs for a wave traveling in a medium with varying speed of wave. We elucidate the role of the local scale of gravitationally-bound regions in assisting the refraction effect to manifest. The refraction effect alters the redshift formulae (Lemaitre, distance-vs-z, luminosity distance-vs-z) and warrants a new analysis of the Pantheon dataset. Upon a reformulation of the distance-redshift relations, we achieve a high-quality fit of the Pantheon dataset to the variable light speed approach; the fit is as robust as that obtained in the standard $\Lambda CDM$ model. We find that the Pantheon dataset is consistent with the variable light speed of the functional form: $a\propto t^{\mu}$ and $c\propto a^{1-1/\mu}$ with (i) the cosmic age $t_{0}\approx 13.9$ Gy as a free parameter, while $\mu$ is unspecified; and (ii) a monotonic variation in the local scale for gravitationally-bound objects (applicable to the emission sources and the Solar System-based apparatus/observer). Due to the agent in (ii), the high-z portion of the Pantheon dataset would produce an "effective" $H_{0}$ estimate which is 10 percent lower than the $H_{0}$ estimate obtained from the low-z portion of the dataset. We offer an alternative interpretation of the accelerating expansion by way of variable speed of light, and as a by-product of the agent uncovered in (ii), a tentative suggestion toward "resolving" the ongoing tension in the Hubble constant estimates.</description>

      <title>Near-IR Weak-Lensing (NIRWL) Measurements in the CANDELS Fields I: Point-Spread Function Modeling and Systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have undertaken a Near-IR Weak Lensing (NIRWL) analysis of the wide-field CANDELS HST/WFC3-IR F160W observations. With the Gaia proper-motion-corrected catalog as an astrometric reference, we updated the astrometry of the five CANDELS mosaics and achieved an absolute alignment within $0.02\pm0.02$ arcsec on average, which is a factor of several superior to existing mosaics. These mosaics are available to download. We investigated the systematic effects that need to be corrected for weak-lensing measurements. We find the largest contributing systematic effect is caused by undersampling. Using stars as a probe of the point-spread function (PSF), we find a sub-pixel centroid dependence on the PSF shape that induces a change in the PSF ellipticity and size by up to 0.02 and $3\%$, respectively. We find that the brighter-fatter effect causes a $2\%$ increase in the size of the PSF and discover a brighter-rounder effect that changes the ellipticity by 0.006. Based on the narrow bandpasses of the WFC3-IR filters and the small range of slopes in a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) within the bandpasses, we suggest that the impact of galaxy SED on PSF is minor in the NIR. Finally, we modeled the PSF of WFC3-IR F160W for weak lensing using a principal component analysis. The PSF models account for temporal and spatial variations of the PSF. The PSF corrections result in residual ellipticities and sizes, $|de_1| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0003$, $|de_2| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0003$, and $|dR| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0001$, that are sufficient for the upcoming NIRWL search for massive overdensities in the five CANDELS fields.

      <title>A self-similar model of galaxy formation and dark halo relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a spherical self-similar model for the formation of a galaxy through gas collapsing in an isolated self-gravitating dark matter halo. We improve upon the existing literature on self-similar collapse in two ways. First, we include the effects of radiative cooling and the formation of a pseudo-disk at the center of collapse, in a parametrised manner. More importantly, we solve for the evolution of gas and dark matter simultaneously and self-consistently using a novel iterative approach. As a result, our model produces shell trajectories of both gas and dark matter that qualitatively agree with the results of full hydrodynamical simulations. We discuss the impact of various ingredients such as the accretion rate, gas equation of state, disk radius and cooling rate amplitude on the evolution of the gas shells. The self-consistent evolution of gas and dark matter allows us to study the response of the dark matter trajectories to the presence of collapsing gas, an effect that has gained increasing importance recently in the context of precision estimates of small-scale statistics like the matter power spectrum. Our default configuration produces a relaxation relation in qualitative agreement with that seen in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and further allows us to easily study the impact of the model ingredients mentioned above. As an initial application, we vary one ingredient at a time and find that the accretion rate and gas equation of state have the largest impact on the relaxation relation, while the cooling amplitude plays only a minor role. Our model thus provides a convenient framework to rapidly explore the coupled nonlinear impact of multiple astrophysical processes on the mass and velocity profiles of dark matter in galactic halos.

      <title>Underluminous 1991bg-like Type Ia supernovae are standardizable candles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the width-luminosity relation used to standardize normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) breaks down in underluminous, 1991bg-like SNe Ia. This breakdown may be due to the choice of parameter used as a stand-in for the width of the SN Ia light curve. Using the colour stretch parameter $s_\mathrm{BV}$ instead of older parameters resolves this issue. Here, I assemble a sample of 14 nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia from the literature, all of which have independent host-galaxy distance moduli and little to no reddening. I use Gaussian process regression to fit the light curves of these SNe in $U/u$, $B$, $V$, $g$, $R/r$, $I/i$, and $H$, and measure their peak absolute magnitudes. I find statistically significant ($&gt;5\sigma$ confidence level in the optical and $&gt;4\sigma$ in the near-infrared) correlations between the peak absolute magnitudes of the 1991bg-like SNe Ia and their $s_\mathrm{BV}$ values in the range $0.2&lt;s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;0.6$. These correlations are broadly consistent with fits to $s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;0.7$ SNe Ia with preliminary $B$- and $V$-band peak absolute magnitudes from the Carnegie Supernova Project and significantly inconsistent with similar fits to normal and transitional SNe Ia (with $0.7&lt;s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;1.1$). The underluminous width-luminosity relation shown here needs to be properly calibrated with a homogeneous sample of 1991bg-like SNe Ia, after which it could be used as a rung on a new cosmological distance ladder. With surface-brightness fluctuations (or another non-Cepheid method) used to calibrate distances to nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia, such a ladder could produce an independent measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre Constant, $H_\mathrm{0}$.</description>

      <title>On the IR Divergences in de Sitter Space: loops, resummation and the semi-classical wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the infrared (IR) divergences in de Sitter (dS) space using the wavefunction method, and explicitly explore how the resummation of higher-order loops leads to the stochastic formalism. In light of recent developments of the cosmological bootstrap, we track the behaviour of these nontrivial IR effects from perturbation theory to the non-perturbative regime. Specifically, we first examine the perturbative computation of wavefunction coefficients, and show that there is a clear distinction between classical components from tree-level diagrams and quantum ones from loop processes. Cosmological correlators at loop level receive contributions from tree-level wavefunction coefficients, which we dub classical loops. This distinction significantly simplifies the analysis of loop-level IR divergences, as we find the leading contributions always come from these classical loops. Then we compare with correlators from the perturbative stochastic computation, and find the results there are essentially the ones from classical loops, while quantum loops are only present as subleading corrections. This demonstrates that the leading IR effects are contained in the semi-classical wavefunction which is a resummation of all the tree-level diagrams. With this insight, we go beyond perturbation theory and present a new derivation of the stochastic formalism using the saddle-point approximation. We show that the Fokker-Planck equation follows as a consequence of two effects: the drift from the Schr\"odinger equation that describes the bulk time evolution, and the diffusion from the Polchinski's equation which corresponds to the exact renormalization group flow of the coarse-grained theory on the boundary. Our analysis highlights the precise and simple link between the stochastic formalism and the semi-classical wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Misalignment production of vector boson dark matter from axion-SU(2) inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new mechanism to generate a coherently oscillating dark vector field from axion-SU(2) gauge field dynamics during inflation. The SU(2) gauge field acquires a nonzero background sourced by an axion during inflation, and it acquires a mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking after inflation. We find that the coherent oscillation of the dark vector field can account for dark matter in the mass range of $10^{-13}-1$ eV in a minimal setup. In a more involved scenario, the range can be wider down to the fuzzy dark matter region. One of the dark vector fields can be identified as the dark photon, in which case this mechanism evades the notorious constraints for isocurvature perturbation, statistical anisotropy, and the absence of ghosts that exist in the usual misalignment production scenarios. Phenomenological implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Annihilation of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capture of dark matter, and its subsequent annihilation, can heat old, isolated neutron stars. In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than $1$ year for vector interactions and $10^4$ years for scalar interactions.</description>
