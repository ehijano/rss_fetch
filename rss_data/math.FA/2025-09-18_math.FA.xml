      <title>Equiangular tight frames in real symplectic space: Zauner's conjecture and the skew Hadamard conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of equiangular tight frames in real symplectic spaces and formulate a conjecture on their existence in terms of the dimension and number of vectors. Our main results shows the "symplectic Zauner's conjecture" is equivalent to the skew Hadamard conjecture. The proof involves counting subgraphs called "diamonds" in tournaments.</description>

      <title>Composition operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates composition and weighted composition operators acting between Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We employ the properties of their reproducing kernel structure to provide a characterization of the boundedness of these operators, which naturally subsumes many results on boundedness of composition operators in the literature. Emphasis is put on Hardy and Bergman spaces on the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_n$ and unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$. Further, we provide an alternative proof for the boundedness of composition operators on the Hardy space of the unit disc, based on reproducing kernel techniques which is different from traditional analytic and operator-theoretic methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral Barron spaces arising from quantum harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, spectral Barron spaces are defined in the framework of quantum harmonic analysis. Their fundamental properties are studied. These include, among others, their completeness structure and some continuous embedding results. As an application, the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of a Schr\"odinger-type equation is proved.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev spaces via interpolation, and applications to mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present a well-known connection between the Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces, also known as Fractional Sobolev spaces, and interpolation theory. We show how Sobolev spaces can be equivalently characterized as real and complex interpolation spaces between Lebesgue spaces and integer-order Sobolev spaces. We also state a spectral theorem for the so-called mixed local-nonlocal operators, and show how interpolation theory leads to its proof. This note is intended for early-career researchers, and aims to provide a concise and accessible introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Shadiness Constant of Finite-Dimensional Normed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the Hahn-Banach theorem, every normed space admits rank-one projections with operator norm one. However, this is not true for higher rank projections. Bosznay and Garay showed that for every $d \geq 3$ there exist $d$-dimensional normed spaces $X$ for which all projections of rank $k$, with $2 \leq k \leq d-1$, have norm larger than or equal to some constant $c&gt;1$. We call the maximal such constant the shadiness constant of $X$. Although constructing such spaces is not difficult, few explicit estimates of their shadiness constants exist. We show how optimization techniques can provide provable lower bounds for these shadiness constants. As an application, we construct a $3$-dimensional normed space whose unit ball is a polytope with $12$ vertices, with shadiness constant at least $1.01$. Furthermore we show that there is no shady norm on $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose unit ball is a polytope with $10$ or fewer vertices, thereby confirming a conjecture by Bosznay and Garay.</description>

      <title>A discrete approach to Zhang's projection inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will provide a new proof of the fact that for any convex body $K\subseteq\R^n$ $$ \frac{{{2n}\choose{n}}}{n^n}n\int_0^\infty r^{n-1}\vol_n(K\cap(re_n+K))dr\leq\frac{(\vol_n(K))^{n+1}}{(\vol_{n-1}(P_{e_n^\perp}(K)))^n}, $$ where $(e_i)_{i=1}^n$ denotes the canonical orthonormal basis in $\R^n$, $P_{e_n^\perp}(K)$ denotes the orthogonal projection of $K$ onto the linear hyperplane orthogonal to $e_n$, and $\vol_k$ denotes the $k$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. This inequality was proved by Gardner and Zhang and it implies Zhang's inequality. We will use our new approach to this inequality in order to prove discrete analogues of this inequality and of an equivalent version of it, where we will consider the lattice point enumerator measure instead of the Lebesgue measure, and show that from such discrete analogues we can recover the aforementioned inequality and, therefore, Zhang's inequality.</description>

      <title>Discrete measured groupoid von Neumann algebras via the Gaussian deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a discrete measured groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we study properties of the corresponding von Neumann algebra $L(\mathcal{G})$ using the techniques of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. More specifically, we define and study the Gaussian deformation associated with any $1$-cocycle of $\mathcal{G}$ and use it to prove primeness and fullness under appropriate assumptions. We also characterize the maximal rigid subalgebras of $L(\mathcal{G})$ and produce unique prime factorization results for algebras of the form $L(\mathcal{G}_1\times\ldots\times\mathcal{G}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Korovkin-type approximation for non-positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Korovkin theorem traditionally relies on the positivity of the underlying sequence of operators. However, in 1968, D. E. Wulbert established the first non-positive version. In this article, we generalize Wulbert's result to the class of uniformly bounded sequence of operators. As an application, we obtain an operator version of this Korovkin-type theorem which will cover existing results in this direction. We also present illustrative examples, one of which has its roots in the Grunwald's interpolation operator. In this context, we also present a direct approach with numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of non-linear operators arising in Compton CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel microlocal analysis of a non-linear ray transform, $\mathcal{R}$, arising in Compton Scattering Tomography (CST). Due to attenuation effects in CST, the integral weights depend on the reconstruction target, $f$, which has singularities. Thus, standard linear Fourier Integral Operator (FIO) theory does not apply as the weights are non-smooth. The V-line (or broken ray) transform, $\mathcal{V}$, can be used to model the attenuation of incoming and outgoing rays. Through novel analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, we characterize the location and strength of the singularities of the ray transform weights. In conjunction, we provide new results which quantify the strength of the singularities of distributional products based on the Sobolev order of the individual components. By combining this new theory, our analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, and classical linear FIO theory, we determine the Sobolev order of the singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$. The strongest (lowest Sobolev order) singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$ are shown to correspond to the wavefront set elements of the classical Radon transform applied to $f$, and we use this idea and known results on the Radon transform to prove injectivity results for $\mathcal{R}$. In addition, we present novel reconstruction methods based on our theory, and we validate our results using simulated image reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Measurable bounded cohomology of measured groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of measurable bounded cohomology for measured groupoids, extending continuous bounded cohomology of locally compact groups. We show that the measurable bounded cohomology of the semidirect groupoid associated to a measure class preserving action of a locally compact group $G$ on a standard Borel space is isomorphic to the continuous bounded cohomology of $G$ with twisted coefficients. We also prove the invariance of measurable bounded cohomology under similarity. As an application, we compare the bounded cohomology of (weakly) orbit equivalent actions and of measure equivalent groups. In this way we recover an isomorphism in bounded cohomology similar to one proved by Monod and Shalom. Other relevant consequences are related to the cohomological vanishing for actions of the Thompson group $F$, of higher rank lattices and of lattices in products of locally compact groups. We obtain a variant of the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism for transitive actions. In the case of a higher rank simple Lie group, we show that the cohomology of the action is actually determined by the usual cohomology of a suitable lattice. For amenable groupoids, we prove that the measurable bounded cohomology is trivial. This generalizes previous results by Monod, Anantharaman-Delaroche and Renault, and Blank.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>
