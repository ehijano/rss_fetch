      <title>Observation of Coherent Perfect Acoustic Absorption at an Exceptional Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have recently shown new possibilities to manipulate wave scattering by exploiting loss, yet coherent perfect absorption at an exceptional point (CPA EP) remains elusive in acoustics. Here we demonstrate it based on a two-channel waveguide with compact lossy resonators. We realize imbalanced losses crucial for CPA EP by using active components to independently modulate the non-Hermiticity. The CPA EP experimentally manifests as full absorption at a unique real frequency and shows high sensitivity to the incident phase variations.Our findings open an avenue to explore novel non-Hermitian physics for classical waves and develop innovative acoustic singularity-based devices.</description>

      <title>A commented translation of Boltzmann's work, "Ueber die sogenannte H-Curve."</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boltzmann's work, ``Ueber die sogenannte H-Curve," discusses his demonstration of the essential characteristics of the H-curve in a clear, concise, and precise style, showcasing his efforts to persuade his peers. To make these findings more widely accessible, the author aims to provide a translated version of the original article, while also correcting some typographical errors in the mathematical expressions with explanatory footnotes. The final section offers concluding remarks with graphs and relevant references for interested readers.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the wave equation outside a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface by sources inside the surface. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are the optimal method for spatial integration, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism: an intrinsic approach to Hadamard's method of descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic geometric framework for the dimensional reduction of classical electromagnetism based on the concept of descent along vector fields of invariance. By exploring the interplay between the Lie derivative and the Hodge star operator, we implement descent conditions on differential forms that reduce Maxwell's equations in four-dimensional spacetime to electromagnetic theories in lower dimensions. We also consider multiple descent along pairwise commuting vector fields of invariance, yielding a finer decomposition of Maxwell's equations. Our results provide a unified and geometrically transparent interpretation of dimensional reduction, with potential applications to field theories in lower-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Thinking Hard About Physics Before Calculating: An Example from Pendulum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to show how to guide students with a familiar example to extract as much physics as possible before jumping into mathematical calculation. The period for a physical pendulum made up of a uniform rod is changed by attaching a piece of putty on it. The period for the combined system depends on the location of the putty. Simple reasoning without calculation shows that there are two locations for the putty that do not change the period of the physical pendulum: the axis and the center of percussion. Moreover, without calculation, we reason that there is at least one minimal period when the putty lies somewhere between these two locations.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Cat -- A Thought Experiment Against Anti-Relativist Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When faced with overwhelming evidence supporting the reality of time dilation, confirmed in particular by the Hafele-Keating experiment, some anti-relativists reluctantly concede that time dilation applies to light clocks. However, they argue that the Theory of Relativity remains flawed, claiming that time dilation applies to light clocks only, not to massive objects. They assert that atomic clocks, which operate based on microwave radiation, merely create the illusion that the Hafele-Keating experiment confirms the theory. To refute this misconception, we introduce a thought experiment inspired by Schrodinger's cat, in which the fate of Einstein's cat depends on a "Sync-or-Die clock", an imaginary device that tests the synchronization between a light clock and a mechanical clock, potentially triggering the release of poison. By analyzing this scenario from both the inertial frame where the device is at rest and another in which it moves at constant velocity, we demonstrate that time dilation must apply to the mechanical clock in exactly the same way as it does to the light clock, highlighting the universality of relativistic time dilation.</description>
