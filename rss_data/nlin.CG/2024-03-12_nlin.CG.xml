      <title>Minimal cellular automaton model with heterogeneous cell sizes predicts epithelial colony growth</title>

Abstract: Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.</description>

      <title>On elementary cellular automata asymptotic (a)synchronism sensitivity and complexity</title>

Abstract: Among the fundamental questions in computer science is that of the impact of synchronism/asynchronism on computations, which has been addressed in various fields of the discipline: in programming, in networking, in concurrence theory, in artificial learning, etc. In this paper, we tackle this question from a standpoint which mixes discrete dynamical system theory and computational complexity, by highlighting that the chosen way of making local computations can have a drastic influence on the performed global computation itself. To do so, we study how distinct update schedules may fundamentally change the asymptotic behaviors of finite dynamical systems, by analyzing in particular their limit cycle maximal period. For the message itself to be general and impacting enough, we choose to focus on a ``simple'' computational model which prevents underlying systems from having too many intrinsic degrees of freedom, namely elementary cellular automata. More precisely, for elementary cellular automata rules which are neither too simple nor too complex (the problem should be meaningless for both), we show that update schedule changes can lead to significant computational complexity jumps (from constant to superpolynomial ones) in terms of their temporal asymptotes.</description>
