      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Based Model for Mapping and Goal-Directed Navigation Using Multiscale Place Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex and partially observable environments remains a central challenge in robotics. Several bio-inspired models of mapping and navigation based on place cells in the mammalian hippocampus have been proposed. This paper introduces a new robust model that employs parallel layers of place fields at multiple spatial scales, a replay-based reward mechanism, and dynamic scale fusion. Simulations show that the model improves path efficiency and accelerates learning compared to single-scale baselines, highlighting the value of multiscale spatial representations for adaptive robot navigation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Modules and Their Interactions in the PSO-X Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PSO-X framework incorporates dozens of modules that have been proposed for solving single-objective continuous optimization problems using particle swarm optimization. While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.</description>

      <title>Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</description>

      <title>Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.</description>

      <title>Evolving Programmatic Skill Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting: A Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-Oriented Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.</description>

      <title>Monaas: Mobile Node as a Service for TSCH-based Industrial IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (&gt; 5.8 s).</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess substantial reasoning capabilities and are increasingly applied to optimization tasks, particularly in synergy with evolutionary computation. However, while recent surveys have explored specific aspects of this domain, they lack an integrative perspective that connects problem modeling with solving workflows. To address this gap, we present a systematic review of recent developments and organize them within a structured framework. First, we classify existing research into two primary stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. Second, we divide the latter into three paradigms based on the role of the LLM: stand-alone optimizers, low-level components embedded within algorithms, and high-level managers for algorithm selection and generation. Third, for each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. Finally, we review interdisciplinary applications across the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. Based on this analysis, we highlight key limitations and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems.

      <title>Robust Differential Evolution via Nonlinear Population Size Reduction and Adaptive Restart: The ARRDE Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</description>
