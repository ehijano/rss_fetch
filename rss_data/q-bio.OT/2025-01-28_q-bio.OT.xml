      <title>The Vertebrate Breed Ontology: Towards Effective Breed Data Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Limited universally-adopted data standards in veterinary medicine hinder data interoperability and therefore integration and comparison; this ultimately impedes the application of existing information-based tools to support advancement in diagnostics, treatments, and precision medicine.
  Objectives: A single, coherent, logic-based standard for documenting breed names in health, production, and research-related records will improve data use capabilities in veterinary and comparative medicine. Methods: The Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO) was created from breed names and related information compiled from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, breed registries, communities, and experts, using manual and computational approaches. Each breed is represented by a VBO term that includes breed information and provenance as metadata. VBO terms are classified using description logic to allow computational applications and Artificial Intelligence-readiness.
  Results: VBO is an open, community-driven ontology representing over 19,500 livestock and companion animal breed concepts covering 49 species. Breeds are classified based on community and expert conventions (e.g., cattle breed) and supported by relations to the breed's genus and species indicated by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy terms. Relationships between VBO terms (e.g., relating breeds to their foundation stock) provide additional context to support advanced data analytics. VBO term metadata includes synonyms, breed identifiers/codes, and attributed cross-references to other databases.
  Conclusion and clinical importance: The adoption of VBO as a source of standard breed names in databases and veterinary electronic health records can enhance veterinary data interoperability and computability.</description>

      <title>A Fourfold Pathogen Reference Ontology Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infectious diseases remain a critical global health challenge, and the integration of standardized ontologies plays a vital role in managing related data. The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. We adopt the "hub and spoke" methodology to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO). The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing and analysis.</description>
