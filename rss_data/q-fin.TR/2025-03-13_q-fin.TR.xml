      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Automated Stock Trading, using xLSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are effective for handling sequential data but have limitations such as gradient vanishing and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies, which can impact their performance in dynamic and risky environments like stock trading. To address these limitations, this study explores the usage of the newly introduced Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM) network in combination with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for automated stock trading. Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the market-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price dynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.</description>

      <title>MarS: a Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's "paradigm shift" potential for a variety of financial applications. We release the code of MarS at https://github.com/microsoft/MarS/.</description>
