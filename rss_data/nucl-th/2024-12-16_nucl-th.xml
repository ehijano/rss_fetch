      <title>Effective temperatures of the QGP from thermal photon and dilepton production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal electromagnetic radiation is emitted by the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout its space-time evolution, with production rates that depend characteristically on the temperature. We study this temperature using thermal photons and dileptons using the Trajectum heavy ion code, which is constrained by Bayesian analysis. In addition we present the elliptic flow of both the thermal photons and thermal dileptons including systematic uncertainties corresponding to the model parameter uncertainty. We give a comprehensive overview of the resulting effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$, obtained from thermal photon transverse momentum and thermal dilepton invariant mass distributions, as well as the dependence of $T_{\rm eff}$ on various selection criteria of these probes. We conclude that the $T_{\rm eff}$ obtained from thermal photons is mostly insensitive to the temperature of the QGP with a value of $T_{\rm eff} \sim$ 250-300 MeV depending on their transverse momentum, almost independent of collision centrality. Thermal dileptons are much better probes of the QGP temperature as they do not suffer from a blue shift as their invariant mass is used, allowing for a more precise constraint of the QGP temperature during different stages of the evolution of the system. By applying selection criteria on the dilepton transverse momentum and the invariant mass we are able to extract fluid temperatures on average times ranging from late emission ($\langle \tau \rangle = 5.6\,$fm$/c$) to very early emissions ($\langle \tau \rangle &lt; 1.0\,$fm$/c$). Furthermore, we show how these selection criteria can be used to map the elliptic flow of the system all throughout its evolution.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ scattering using nucleon-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ optical potentials fitted to four-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteron-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ reactions in the 15 to 40 MeV range are studied using a three-body model where the constructed nonlocal optical potentials rely on rigorous nucleon-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ scattering calculations. The differential cross section for the elastic scattering and neutron transfer reaction is predicted quite well up to 90 deg scattering angles. The importance of the Pauli term in complex potentials is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Improving the predictive power of empirical shell-model Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two developments which enhance the predictive power of empirical shell model Hamiltonians for cases in which calibration data is sparse. A recent improvement in the ab initio derivation of effective Hamiltonians leads to a much better starting point for the optimization procedure. In addition, we introduce a protocol to avoid over-fitting, enabling a more reliable extrapolation beyond available data. These developments will enable more robust predictions for exotic isotopes produced at rare isotope beam facilities and in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics in the Density Frame: Numerical Tests and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics in the Density Frame for one-dimensional fluid flows. The Density Frame is a formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics that is first-order in time, requires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our results to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. Additionally, the Density Frame results remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicability. We also compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrodynamic theory developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) and a well-known M\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type hydrodynamics code, MUSIC, which is commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Fame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantum stresses in the hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational form factors are often interpreted as providing access to stresses inside hadrons, in particular through Fourier transforms of the form factors $D$ and $\bar{c}$. Some researchers, however, have expressed skepticism of this interpretation. I revisit the question, and argue that it is indeed appropriate to interpret these quantities as stress distributions. I consider the hydrogen atom's ground state as a familiar example, and use the pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics to give the distributions a clear meaning. A striking result is that $\bar{c}$ -- rather than $D$ -- quantifies the force law binding the system, which can be understood through Cauchy's first law of motion.</description>

      <title>In-medium electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons from the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the modifications of hadron structure in a nuclear medium, focusing on the spacelike electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) of light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. By combining the light-front quark model (LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces EMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter, respectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of mesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced neutron, proton and alpha evaporation from heavy nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb nuclei are excited through interactions induced by strong electromagnetic fields. The expected excitation energy could reach hundreds MeV, which leads to the subsequent emission of various particles, including neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. To accurately describe deexcitation of nuclei, we have developed two novel approaches. The first method utilizes the Heavy Ion Phase Space Exploration (HIPSE) model to simulate pre-equilibrium emissions and to estimate the excitation energy of the remaining nucleus. Our second approach introduces a new technique for modeling the excitation energy of the nucleus. This method consists of a two-component function to represent the excitation energy distribution more precisely, accounting for the energy loss due to the interaction between photons and quasi-deuteron. Both of these modeling techniques are integrated with the results produced by the GEMINI++ generator, which implements the Hauser-Feshbach formalism to simulate the statistical decay of excited nuclei. The alternative calculations are done with EMPIRE platform. Using these approaches, we obtained the cross sections for the emission of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles resulting from UPC at the LHC. Our results were compared with the experimental data of the ALICE group on neutron and proton multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Equation of State Independent Determination on the Radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star Using Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining the radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star ($R_{1.4}$) rely on specific equations of state (EOS) models that describe various types of dense nuclear matter. This dependence on EOS models can introduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the measurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we explore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However, this work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially decreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius measurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical methods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot configurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects on the inferred radius. Our results are consistent with X-ray timing, gravitational wave, and nuclear physics constraints, while avoiding EOS-related biases. The same method has also been applied to a simulated mass-radius dataset, based on our knowledge of future X-ray telescopes, demonstrating the model's ability to recover the injected $R_{1.4}$ value in certain cases. This method provides a data-driven pathway for extracting neutron star properties and offers a new approach for future observational efforts in neutron star astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Towards a foundation model for heavy-ion collision experiments through point cloud diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary heavy-ion physics research aims to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering problem can be implemented in a square-integrable basis via the so-called $J$-matrix method. While methods to compute the phase shift in the $J$-matrix approach are known, we introduce a novel formula in square-integrable bases analogous to existing integral relations or overlap integrals in a (continuous) position basis. We demonstrate the method in single-channel potential scattering. Such a result is the first step towards a more general approach to scattering and reactions in popular many-body methods such as the configuration-interaction shell model.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the thermo-chemical freeze-out condition of the multi-component hot and dense hadron resonance gas (HRG) formed in the ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions (URNNC). The van der Waals (VDW) type model used in the present analysis incorporates the repulsive as well as attractive interactions among the hadrons. The baryons (antibaryons) are treated as incompressible objects. Using this theoretical approach the values of the model freeze-out parameters of the system are extracted over a wide range of collision energy by analyzing experimental data on like-mass antibaryon to baryon ratios. The same set of parameters is found to explain the energy dependence of several other particle ratios quite satisfactorily. We find that the horn-like structures seen in the ratios of strange particles to pions as a function of the collision energy cannot be explained by the VDW-HRG model alone without considering the strangeness imbalance effect in the system. We have compared our freeze-out line with those obtained earlier. The correlation between the $\bar{p}/p$ and $K^-/K^+$ ratios is also examined.</description>

Abstract: In February and March 2024, a series of many Type I X-ray bursts from the accreting neutron star SRGA J144459.2$-$604207, which has been identified by multiple X-ray satellites, with the first reports coming from INTEGRAL and NinjaSat. These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior as a ``clocked'' burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 X-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short plateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in the tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In this study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various compositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of hydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\rm CNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\rm CNO}$ and/or lower $X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. Therefore, we propose that this new X-ray burster is likely the first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover, based on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed by NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \approx 1.5$ seems preferred over high-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for the neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the potential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related to the properties of the hot CNO cycle.</description>
