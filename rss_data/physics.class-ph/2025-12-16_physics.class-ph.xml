      <title>The satisfaction of the reciprocity condition of the equivalent stiffness matrix in laminated structures composed of anisotropic layers through static equilibrium, Hooke law, and perfect bonding conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, it is analytically demonstrated how the stiffness matrix of a laminated structure composed of anisotropic layers satisfies the reciprocity condition solely based on the mandatory requirements imposed by static equilibrium, Hooke law, and perfect bonding between layers. The material properties of the equivalent volume are expressed as weighted sums of the individual layer properties. No additional assumptions, energy principles, or supplementary hypotheses are employed in this process.</description>

      <title>Experimental design of a millifluidic flow-focusing method for biomimetic nanocellulose and hemicellulose-based biopolymer fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical performance of plant fibres is linked to the presence of crystalline elements dispersed within an amorphous cohesive matrix. The more the crystalline reinforcement is aligned with the fibre axis, the better the mechanical properties of the fibre. With the aim of developing entirely biobased biomimetic fibres as alternatives to synthetic or resource-consuming fibres, we have studied the fabrication of hydrogel filaments made from mixtures of nanocelluloses, biobased crystalline nanoparticles acting as reinforcement, and xyloglucans, a plant wall hemicellulose with a strong affinity for cellulose surfaces. These will ensure cohesion between the nanocelluloses. To optimize the orientation of the nanocelluloses within the filaments, and thus potentially improve the mechanical properties of the fibres, we present a study on the development of a millifluidic method of flow-focusing. The developed setup uses external sheath flows to focus and align a nanocellulose suspension central flow. Different configurations in terms of concentrations, circuit designs and flow velocities are tested. 3D printed circuits are explored to produce versatile geometries and optimize the process design. To qualify the orientations during the process, observations with a polarized microscope (POM) are made, as the alignment of the nanocellulose crystalline structures creates birefringence in suspensions. Significant optical phase shifts related to the nanocellulose particles' orientations are visible by color gradients, varying with the suspensions' concentrations and flow velocities. Results demonstrate successful tuning of nanocellulose orientation into anisotropic hydrogels using different millifluidic circuit geometries, with the introduction of xyloglucans to produce new types of biosourced fibres.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fourier methods with beer bottles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As anyone who has blown across the mouth of a beer bottle knows, beer bottles have a well-defined fundamental frequency. This paper shows how a beer bottle's acoustical resonance can be modeled as a one-dimensional driven-damped oscillator and includes enough detail to be useful in undergraduate laboratory experiments. While the frequency-domain Green's function of the bottle can be extracted through sequential pure-tone measurements, sufficient data to fit the model's parameters can be collected in just a few seconds when Fourier methods are used.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Multi-Terminal Systems with Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly overmoded and periodically loaded structures, such as the iris-line waveguide, offer an attractive solution for the efficient transportation of diffraction-prone THz pulses over long distances (hundreds of meters). This paper presents the full-scatter field theory that allows us to analytically derive all the spectral (modal) coefficients on the discontuities of the iris line. The spectral analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive surfaces. An advanced application of Lorentz's reciprocity theory, using a generalized guided-field configuration, is developed to reduce complexity of the mode-matching problem over nonuniform sections. The used technique is quite general and applies to a wide class of structures, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory agrees with and expands previously established techniques, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation. The used formulation also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
