      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star formation efficiency from giant molecular clouds to galactic scale in high-redshift starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is inherently complex, involving the interplay of physical processes over a hierarchy of spatial scales. In this work, we investigate the connection between global (galaxy-scale) and local (cloud-scale) star formation efficiencies (SFEs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), using the state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation suite THESAN-ZOOM. We find that the galaxy-scale average SFE, $\langle \epsilon^{\rm gal}_{\rm ff} \rangle$, scales with $M_{\rm halo}^{1/3}\,(1+z)^{1/2} \sim V_{\rm vir}$, consistent with expectations from feedback-regulated models. On cloud scales, we identify giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in a broad sample of high-redshift starbursts spanning a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. Star formation in these systems is predominantly hosted by filamentary GMCs embedded in a dense and highly turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). GMCs exhibit remarkably universal properties, including mass function, size, turbulence, and surface density, regardless of the environment in which they are identified. The global gas depletion time (and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) is determined by the GMC mass fraction in the ISM, while the cloud-scale SFE shows little variation. In particular, we find a nearly constant gas surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm GMC} \approx 70\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ across different host galaxies. Nevertheless, we identify two regimes where phases with high SFE can arise. First, stars may form efficiently in the shock fronts generated by feedback from a preceding starburst. Second, the increasing background dark matter surface density with redshift may contribute to the gravitational potential of clouds at $z \gtrsim 8$ and confine them in high-SFE phases over extended periods.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies up to $z\gtrsim 10$, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The NGC3109 Satellite System: The First Systematic Resolved Search for Dwarf Galaxies Around a SMC-mass Host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of the deepest search to date for dwarf galaxies around NGC3109, a barred spiral galaxy with a mass similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using a semi-automated search method. Using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), we survey a region covering a projected distance of $\sim$70 kpc of NGC 3109 ($D$ = 1.3 Mpc, $R_\mathrm{vir}\sim$ 90 kpc, $M\sim10^8M_\ast$) as part of the MADCASH and DELVE-DEEP programs. Through our resolved and newly designed semi-resolved searches, we successfully recover the known satellites Antlia and Antlia B. We identified a promising candidate, which was later confirmed to be a background dwarf through deep follow-up observations. Our detection limits are well defined, with the sample $\sim 80\%$ complete down to $M_V\sim-$8.0 , and includes detections of dwarf galaxies as faint as $M_V\sim-$6.0. This is the first comprehensive study of a satellite system through resolved star around an SMC mass host. Our results show that NGC 3109 has more bright ($M_V\sim-$9.0) satellites than the mean predictions from cold dark matter (CDM) models, but well within the host-to-host scatter. A larger sample of LMC/SMC-mass hosts is needed to test whether or not the observations are consistent with current model expectations.</description>

      <title>OTI on FIRE: Testing the Efficacy of Orbital Torus Imaging to Recover the Galactic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2 vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk, reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (&gt;1.5 kpc) scale heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability and spatial regularity of the gas clouds and young stellar population in spiral arms of NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. There is a contradiction between the characteristic spacings in observed regular chains of star-forming regions in the spiral arms of galaxies, ~500 pc, and the estimates of the wavelength of gravitational instability in them, &gt;1 kpc. Aims. Calculating the scales of regularity in the grand-design galaxy NGC 628 in terms of gravitational instability, using modern high-quality observational data and comparison of them with scales of spatial regularity of the star-forming regions and molecular clouds in the spiral arms of the galaxy. Methods. We investigate two mechanisms of gravitational instability against radial and azimuthal perturbations in a multi-component disk with a finite thickness. We obtain a map of the instability wavelength distribution and compare its median value with the typical scale of observed regularity. Results. The maps of instability parameters Q and S, which are related to radial and azimuthal perturbations respectively, show a good alignment between gravitationally unstable regions and areas of recent star formation. By analyzing the distribution of giant molecular clouds along the spiral arms of NGC 628, we found a similar regularity of about 500-600 pc that was previously observed for starforming regions. Additionally, the distribution of the wavelength most unstable to azimuthal perturbations yielded a median value of about 700 pc, which is close to the observed scale regularity. This last finding resolved the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observed scales of star-forming regions' regularity.</description>

      <title>The {\it AGORA} High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. VIII: Disk Formation and Evolution of Simulated Milky Way Mass Galaxy Progenitors at $1&lt;z&lt;5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how differences in the stellar feedback produce disks with different morphologies in Milky Way-like progenitors over 1 $\leq z \leq 5$, using eight state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation codes in the \textit{AGORA} project. In three of the participating codes, a distinct, rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\lesssim 300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit similar signs of wet compaction -- gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst phase -- at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones. Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients, whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass radii of these two groups diverge at $z \sim 3$, the inclusion of dust extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations -- such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths -- that regulate both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project VII: Satellite quenching in zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones. While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its 1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective in satellites with $M_* &lt; 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods employed.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Polar Ring Galaxies with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of our research is to create a catalog of strong and good candidates for PRGs using existing catalogs of PRGs, develop an image-based approach with machine learning methods for the search and discovery of PRGs in a big sky survey, and explore the capability of the CIGALE software for determining their multiwavelength properties. For the first time, we applied a deep learning method to the search for PRGs. We visually inspected galaxies from existing catalogs of PRGs to create a training sample based on high-quality SDSS images. Since the resulting training sample was extremely small (87 strong and good PRGs), we applied augmentation, image segmentation, and ensemble learning techniques. However, most effective method was transfer learning with its ability to enlarge the training sample by synthetic images generated by GALFIT. To examine deep learning approach for finding new PRGs we used the SDSS catalog of galaxies at z &lt; 0.1. The method with synthetic images showed that even with overtraining we were able to find galaxies with a ring pattern. Our deep learning approach has resulted in the discovery of three PRGs (SDSS J140644.42+471602.0; SDSS J133650.48+492745.3; SDSS J095717.30+364953.5). Also, we visually inspected the Catalog of the SDSS Ring galaxies at z &lt; 0.1 and discovered four PRGs among ~2,200 ring galaxies (SDSS J095851.32+320422.9; SDSS J104211.05+234448.2; SDSS J162212.63+272032.2; SDSS J104600.10+090627.2). One of the discovered galaxies with transfer learning, SDSS J140644.42+471602.0, was studied with CIGALE software to determine its spectral energy distribution in IR-UV bands. The current SFR is 71 M_sun per year, although the lack of FUV data limits this estimate. The total stellar mass is 8.34x10^{10} M_sun. The predominance of an old stellar population (two-thirds of the total mass) suggests that this PRG is undergoing interaction process.</description>

      <title>Green Flash: Residual Emissions Enshrouded in Low-mass Balmer-break Galaxies at $z\sim5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered galaxies that are already passively evolving at $z&gt;4$, $\sim1.5$\,Gyr after the Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such as \ha\ and \oiii\ while showing a strong continuum break at $\sim3650$\,\AA\ i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the nature of four such galaxies at $z=5.10$--$5.78$ identified in the Abell~2744 field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent since $\sim100$\,Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which could be a {\it residual} signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+\oiii\ emission line map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more compact ($R_e=0.7$\,kpc) than the stellar component ($R_e=0.9$\,kpc). For this specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner of ``outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in massive galaxies at later cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Optical QPOs with dual periodicities 1103days and 243days in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the possible existence of a binary supermassive black holes (BSMBH) system in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056 (=SDSS J1004+1510) at z=0.219 based on the detection of robust optical QPOs. We determine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r band light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad emission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet and disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\pm260$days and $243\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence level exceeding $5\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the $1103\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light curve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS J1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\pm0.14)\times10^8 M_{\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of $1103\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\pm29$days could be attributed to harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\pm260)/(243\pm29)\sim4.54\pm0.47$ with large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\pm29$days was from an independent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably expected, with space separations of $0.00036\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH system and of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH, after considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the central BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves from the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs candidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could be helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading to rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the serendipitous discovery of a double-double radio galaxy (DDRG) with a projected linear size exceeding 2 Mpc, hosted by a spiral galaxy. This unique combination of a giant radio structure and a spiral host challenges the prevailing view that such extreme radio sources reside only in elliptical galaxies. Using high-resolution optical imaging from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (DR10), we confirm a spiral-arm feature and a disk-component in the surface brightness profile fitting for the host galaxy (LEDA 896325) having a black hole of mass 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. Radio observations from RACS and GLEAM reveal two distinct pairs of radio lobes. Using the multi-frequency analysis of radio data, we obtained the spectral index distribution and estimate the spectral ages of the outer and inner radio lobes to be approximately 120 and 35 Myr, respectively. Our results confirm recurrent jet activity in this disk galaxy and establish it as the largest known radio galaxy in a spiral host, and its double-double structure makes it the largest of only three such spiral-host DDRGs, demonstrating that disk galaxies can indeed launch extremely large-scale radio jets.</description>

      <title>The "Dark-Matter Dominated" Galaxy Segue 1 Modeled with a Black Hole and no Dark Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M_\odot$. The value of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars. Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots seen in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Testing the Hypothesis that the Quasar J0950+5128 Harbors a Supermassive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950+5128 spanning 22 years show that its broad H$\beta$ emission line displays monotonic radial velocity variations consistent with those expected from a supermassive binary. At the same time, the profile of the broad H$\beta$ line is changing, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust measurements of the broad H$\beta$ velocity shifts. We fit the spectra with a multi-component parametric model to isolate the broad H$\beta$ by removing the stellar and non-stellar continua, the Fe ii line blends, and various narrow and broad emission lines in its vicinity. We measure the H$\beta$ velocity shifts via cross-correlation, both before and after decomposing the spectra, and we demonstrate that they can be reliably measured in spite of variations in the line profiles. We incorporate radial velocity "jitter" into the radial velocity curve to emulate typical quasar variability, and fit the curve with a Keplerian orbit model. The fit yields a period of 33 years and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}$ pc and $10^7\ M_\odot$, respectively. Thus, this quasar is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate its credentials.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Paths to Merger of Unequal-Mass Black Hole Binaries in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Abstract: The accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to house populations of stars and compact objects; after forming binaries these compact objects may merge, begetting gravitational waves such as those detected by LIGO and VIRGO. We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly-equal-mass binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped; retrograde binaries inspiral $\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with mass ratios of $m_2/m_1\lesssim0.4$ experience significantly weaker headwinds and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities, slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives prograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are driven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based gravitational wave observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly useful for studying these populations.</description>

      <title>A Random Forest spectral classification of the Gaia 500-pc white dwarf population</title>

Abstract: The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular, our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify 78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates, and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study of the white dwarf population.</description>

      <title>The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.</description>

      <title>EMU: Cross-correlating EMU Pilot Survey 1 with Dark Energy Survey to constrain the radio galaxy redshift distribution</title>

Abstract: Radio continuum galaxy surveys can provide a relatively fast map of the projected distribution of structure in the Universe, at the cost of lacking information about the radial distribution. We can use these surveys to learn about the growth of structure and the fundamental physics of the Universe, but doing so requires extra information to be provided in the modelling of the redshift distribution, $dN/dz$. In this work, we show how the cross-correlation of the two dimensional radio continuum map with another galaxy map (in this case a photometric optical extragalactic survey), with a known redshift distribution, can be used to determine the redshift distribution through statistical inference. We use data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey 1 and cross-correlate it with optical data from the Dark Energy Survey to fit the parameters of our $dN/dz$ model. We show that the recovered distribution fits the data much better than current simulated $dN/dz$ models available in the literature, and peaks at a much higher redshift. These results will have significance for future cosmological analyses with large-scale radio continuum surveys such as the full EMU, or with the SKAO.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to decades of observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the structure of galaxies at redshift $z&gt;2$ has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of the galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 49 massive galaxies ($\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&gt;9$) at redshift $3&lt;z&lt;5$. The MIRI 5.6~$\mu$m imaging allows us to characterize the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older and dust-insensitive stellar populations. We derive the non-parametric morphology of galaxies and model the light distribution of galaxies with a single S\'ersic component and derive their parametric morphology. We find that at $z&gt;3$ massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam observations at $\sim1.5~\mu$m is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, where galaxies at redshift $z&gt;3.75$ show later-type morphologies compared to $z\sim3$ galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build-up, which is already taking place at $z\sim3-4$. The combined analysis of NIRCam and MIRI imaging datasets allows us to prove that the rest-frame near-infrared morphology of massive galaxies at cosmic noon is typical of compact disk galaxies with a smooth mass distribution.</description>

Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates (from highly sub-critical to super-critical). We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty torus-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation as a ruler for galaxy evolution: insights from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>

Abstract: Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass ($M_*$) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understanding the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at $z=3-10$ with $10^6&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{10}$, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude $A_{100}$ on 100 Myr; a time delay $t_d$ between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor $\epsilon_{SN}$. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows ($\epsilon_{SN}=1/4$), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires $t_d=20$ Myr and a $A_{100}=1/3$ modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.2$), yielding a MZR dispersion of $\sigma_{Z}=0.2$. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.24$, $\sigma_{Z}=0.3$), clarifying why SERRA shows flatter trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.5$) result in a ``chemical chaos'' (i.e. $\sigma_{Z}=1.4$), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.8$) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics IV: Non Rotating Galaxies</title>

Abstract: At it stands, the $\Lambda CDM$ model does not anticipate the early emergence of massive galaxies. Canonical Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) seems to fail at late time solar system scale and Wide-Binary scales. To match data, a MOND variant needs a variable MOND acceleration $a_0$ which is strong at high redshift galactic scale and diminishes over redshift to far below Newtonian gravity at solar system scale at late time. We found such a candidate in a relativistic frame-work. In a previous work, a new single-metric solution of Einstein Gravity is found for a point mass residing in an expanding universe, which apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional MOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the cosmological acceleration $\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. This cosmological acceleration is shown to be far below Newtonian acceleration in the solar system and therefore avoids the problem of MOND program. In this work, we study the monolithic evolution of a Milky Way mass protogalactic cloud at recombination in this model where the non-Newtonian acceleration is stronger than Newtonian gravity. To obtain a spherical galaxy we assume that a point on a mass shell at turnaround will pick up sufficient non-systematic angular momentum. Assuming a violent relaxation process similar to the simulation studies for MOND and Newtonian gravity, we find that the central core can form a time independent Quasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by z&gt;7, which could explain the galaxy morphology stability observations for $z&lt;6.5$. The virialised potential has a Newtonian acceleration dominant central region and a MOND-like acceleration dominant outer region. We evaluate the corresponding MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ in a virialised potential for a Milky-Way mass elliptical galaxy and find that $a_0^{VM}\sim a_0$.</description>

      <title>A negligible contribution of two luminous $z$ ~ 7.5 galaxies to the ionizing photon budget of reionization</title>

Abstract: We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}$ magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at $z\sim7.5$, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1$"$ (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log($M_\ast/M_\odot$) $\sim$ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O$_{32}$ ratios of 5.3 and $&gt;5.8$, and $\beta$ slopes of $-1.92$ and $-1.51$, respectively. We use the Mg II$\lambda\lambda$2796,2803 doublet to constrain $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ trends observed with $\beta$, O$_{32}$, and the H$\beta$ equivalent width at $z&lt;4$. The small inferred ionized region sizes ($&lt;0.3$ pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these $z&gt;7$ $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.</description>

      <title>Cooling Flows as a Reference Solution for the Hot Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) in $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos is dominated by a hot phase ($T \gtrsim 10^{6}$ K). While many models exist for the hot gas structure, there is as yet no consensus. We compare cooling flow models, in which the hot CGM flows inward due to radiative cooling, to the CGM of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos in galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project at $z\sim0$. The simulations include realistic cosmological evolution and feedback from stars but neglect AGN feedback. At both mass scales, CGM inflows are typically dominated by the hot phase rather than by the `precipitation' of cold gas. Despite being highly idealized, we find that cooling flows describe $\sim 10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos very well, with median agreement in the density and temperature profiles of $\sim 20\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively. This indicates that stellar feedback has little impact on CGM scales in those halos. For $\sim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos, the thermodynamic profiles are also accurately reproduced in the outer CGM. For some of these lower-mass halos, cooling flows significantly overpredict the hot gas density in the inner CGM. This could be due to multidimensional angular momentum effects not well captured by our 1D cooling flow models and/or to the larger cold gas fractions in these regions. Turbulence, which contributes $\sim 10-40\%$ of the total pressure, must be included to accurately reproduce the temperature profiles. Overall, cooling flows predict entropy profiles in better agreement with the FIRE simulations than other idealized models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- II. Critical halo mass and core mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation and mass distribution of the first stars depend on various environmental factors in the early universe. We compare 120 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore how the baryonic streaming velocity (SV) relative to dark matter affects the formation of the first stars. We vary SV from zero to three times its cosmic root-mean-square value, $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV}=0-3$, and identify 20 representative halos from cosmological simulations. For each model, we follow the evolution of a primordial star-forming cloud from the first appearance of a dense core (with gas density &gt; $10^{6}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) until 2 Myr later. In each model, higher SV systematically delays the formation of primordial clouds, formed inside more massive halos ($10^{5}-10^{7}\,{\rm M}_\odot$), and promotes cloud-scale fragmentation and multiple-core formation. The number and total mass of dense cores increase with increasing SV. More than half of models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \ge 1.5$ form three or more dense cores in a single halo. In extreme cases, up to 25 cores form at once, which leaves a massive first star cluster. On the other hand, models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \leq 1$ form only one or two cores in a halo. In addition, HD-cooling is often enabled in models with low SV, especially in low-z, where HD-cooling is enabled in more than 50% of models. This leads to the formation of the low-mass first star. SV shapes the resulting initial mass function of the first stars and plays a critical role in setting the star-forming environment of the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new way to identify systems similar to our Local Group (LG) of galaxies in cosmological simulations. Our method uses as a new constraint the speed and direction of the LG's center of mass, which we can measure accurately from cosmic microwave background data. When we apply these criteria to different cosmological simulations and compare the results with traditional selection methods, we find statistically significant differences. Our approach produces simulated galaxy pairs where the relative M31 velocity is less radial (2 to 10 percent difference over the mean) and more tangential (1 to 4 percent difference over the mean) than in cases that do not take into account the barycenter speed. The radial change pattern appears consistently across all cosmological models we test, showing that matching the observed barycenter velocity has a measurable effect when modeling and interpreting Local Group-like systems.</description>

      <title>Physical Conditions of the Ionized Superwind in NGC 253 with VLT/MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) XXII. Chandra observations of narrow-line quasar candidates at z&gt;6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within active galactic nuclei (AGN) J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of the sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational-wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an EM counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multimessenger astronomy.</description>
