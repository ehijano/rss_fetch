      <title>The mass-to-flux ratio in molecular clouds. What are we really measuring?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of molecular clouds is a parameter of central importance as it quantifies the dynamical significance of the magnetic field with respect to gravitational forces. Therefore, it can provide invaluable information on the fate of clouds, and the sites of star formation. Our objective was to study the accuracy with which we can measure the true mass-to-flux ratio in molecular clouds under various projection angles and identify systematic biases. We used a 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamic chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. We quantified the accuracy with which the mass-to-flux ratio is recovered under various projection angles and dynamical stages by analyzing the magnetic field - gas column density relation, and comparing the "observed" mass-to-flux ratio against the true values. We find that projection effects have a major effect on measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio. Zeeman measurements can overestimate the true mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud by more than an order of magnitude when the magnetic field primarily lies on the plane of the sky. Therefore, measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio based on Zeeman observations should be considered as upper limits. Mass-to-flux ratio estimates inferred from polarization observations do not provide a physically meaningful probe of the true mass-to-flux ratio and can lead to unphysical results as they fail to capture the underlying correlation between the magnetic field and column density.</description>

      <title>On the missing dust of super-early galaxies: Supernova blowout and gas-dust venting in Blue Monsters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of very young, super-early galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, often termed Blue Monsters, shows extremely blue UV continua and faint far-IR emission, which could imply much less dust than expected from standard enrichment scenarios. We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>How is cold, star-forming gas in galaxies affected by magnetic fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations provide a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the role of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium of galaxies and in star formation. However, many existing galaxy-scale numerical simulations impose a Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) star formation law by construction. In this paper, we present two Arepo simulations of an isolated star-forming galaxy with and without magnetic fields, using sink particles to model star formation without imposing a KS relation. We examine global differences between the models, and investigate the impacts on star formation. We include a time-dependent, non-equilibrium chemical network coupled to a thermal evolution scheme and supernova feedback. Our magnetic field amplifies via dynamo action from a small initial seed field. We find a more compact magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc (radius ~ 5.1kpc, compared to ~ 7.4kpc), with a diffuse atomic envelope above and below the plane that is not seen in the hydrodynamic (HD) case. The HD disc displays a smoother, more even radial distribution of gas and star formation, and more bubbly substructure. Our MHD simulation has a higher proportion of dense, gravitationally unbound gas than the HD case, but a lower star formation rate, an average between 125-150Myr of ~ 4.8 solar masses per year, compared to ~ 8.4 solar masses per year. We see a clear shift in the KS relation to higher gas surface densities in the MHD case, more consistent with observations. The additional magnetic support against gravitational collapse seems to raise the threshold gas surface density required for star formation.</description>

      <title>The dynamic central environment of NGC 3516 revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed, time-resolved analysis of the Fe K band of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3516 observed with XRISM. The 249 ks observation spanning $\sim$310 ks in elapsed time reveals an exceptionally rich and time-variable absorption spectrum. Six distinct absorption components are detected across multiple ionization states, spanning more than an order of magnitude in ionization parameter and a wide range of systemic velocities, from a potential inflow ($+4300~\rm km~s^{-1}$) to a mildly relativistic ultra-fast outflow ($-9800~\rm km~s^{-1}$). Despite their diversity, the components exhibit relatively small broadening ($\lesssim$$400~\rm km~s^{-1}$), implying comparable internal dynamics within a medium of a complex structure. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals pronounced variability in three highly ionized absorbers, with Fe XXV$-$Fe XXVI features that appear and disappear on timescales of tens of kiloseconds. This behavior likely reflects a combination of geometrical transits of clumpy gas and ionization-state changes driven by continuum variability. An additional temporary absorption feature in the red wing of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, consistent with Fe XXV absorption, indicates a possible transient ultra-fast inflow at $\sim$$15\,000~\rm km~s^{-1}$ ($\sim$5% $c$). Finally, the continuum light curve exhibits a tentative $\sim$40 ks oscillatory pattern, accompanied by correlated shifts of a weak, narrow Fe K$\alpha$ emission feature, suggesting dynamic coupling between the continuum and the line-emitting region. Together, these results reveal that the nuclear environment of NGC 3516 is dominated by rapidly evolving, multi-phase gas flows, where accretion, ejection, and ionization processes are tightly coupled on sub-parsec scales.</description>

      <title>LEGA-C stellar populations scaling relations. I: Chemo-archaeological downsizing trends at z~0.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze stellar population properties of 552 galaxies at redshift 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.77 from the LEGA-C spectroscopic survey. This first paper in a series presents the catalog of revised absorption indices for LEGA-C DR3 and inferred physical parameters, and derives benchmark scaling relations for the general massive galaxy population at intermediate redshift. We estimate light-weighted mean ages and stellar metallicities by interpreting key stellar absorption features and rizYJ photometry in a Bayesian framework with a comprehensive library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuations. We discuss systematic uncertainties within our method and compared to other spectral fitting approaches. We derive volume-weighted scaling relations of light-weighted mean ages and stellar metallicities with stellar mass for the general galaxy population at &lt;z&gt;=0.7 and masses &gt;10^10Msun. The downsizing trends observed locally were already in place 6 Gyr ago. We observe bimodal age distribution as a function of mass, transitioning around 10^11Msun. No bimodality appears in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, which changes from steep to flat across 10^10.8Msun. Similar trends emerge for age and metallicity with velocity dispersion, but with sharper transition from young to old around log(sigma)=2.3. Differences with respect to trens with stellar mass suggest that age primarily depends on velocity dispersion below and above the transition regime, while both stellar mass and velocity dispersion contribute to stellar metallicity. The catalogs of revised absorption index measurements for LEGA-C DR3 and inferred stellar population physical parameters will be released to public repositories. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Tracing Nitrogen Enrichment across Cosmic Time with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics. The chemical signatures of N/O-enhanced galaxies in our sample resembles that of first-generation globular cluster stars, suggesting that the moderate nitrogen enhancement may reflect the late stages of a cluster-driven enrichment mode that dominated at earlier cosmic epochs. However, the relevance and relative contribution of different mechanisms (e.g. burstiness of the star-formation history, contribution from older stellar populations, differential metal-loaded outflows, inflows of pristine gas) remains to be fully disentangled.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Dark Matter Subhalo Constraints from Stellar Streams using Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evidence for dark matter (DM) remains compelling, although attempts to understand its particle nature remain inconclusive. One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy. These results demonstrate the power of implicit likelihood inference for optimizing stellar stream observational strategies and forecasting DM subhalo constraints from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing Infrared eXcess to Investigate Early-Universe Dust (PIXIEDust)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the implied presence of dust through reddened UV emission in high-redshift galaxies, no dust emission has been detected in the (sub)millimetre regime beyond $z &gt; 8.3$. This study combines around two hundred hours of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations on ten $z &gt; 8$ galaxies, revealing no significant dust emission down to a $1 \sigma$ depth of $2.0$, $2.0$, and $1.5 \,\mu$Jy at rest-frame 158, 88 $\mu$m, and across all the data, respectively. This constrains average dust masses to be below $&lt; 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $3 \sigma$ and dust-to-stellar mass ratios to be below $3.7 \times{} 10^{-4}$ (assuming $T_{\rm dust} = 50$ K and $\beta_{\rm dust} = 2.0$). Binning by redshift ($8 &lt; z &lt; 9.5$ and $9.5 &lt; z &lt; 15$), UV-continuum slope ($\beta_{\rm UV} \lessgtr -2$) and stellar mass ($\log_{10} M_{\ast}/{\rm M_{\odot}} \lessgtr 9$) yields similarly stringent constraints. Combined with other studies, these results are consistent with inefficient dust build-up in the $z &gt; 8$ Universe, likely due to inefficient supernova production, limited interstellar grain growth and/or ejection by outflows. We provide data and tools online to facilitate community-wide high-redshift dust searches.</description>

      <title>Danger Zone: Establishing Buffers for Enhanced Classification in BPT Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes unsupervised machine learning, specifically the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, to classify optical spectra originating from star-forming regions, Seyferts, and low-ionization (nuclear) emission-line regions (LI(N)ERs) based on their line ratios. Typically, the ionization source of a region is determined from intensity ratio of different combinations of pairs of spectral lines. However, using current boundary definitions, $\sim10$\% of spectra change classes between diagnostic diagrams. We apply the machine learning technique to $\sim$1.3 million optical spectra from 6,439 galaxies observed in the MaNGA survey. By training UMAP on consistently classified data, we can classify these ``ambiguous'' spectra, and delineate boundary zones where such ambiguities arise. Furthermore, we identify physically interesting subsets within the ambiguous spectra. Future work will incorporate additional parameters, such as alternative emission line ratios and velocity dispersions, to enhance classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>SAGAN-VI: When Jets Meet Filaments -- Environmental Imprints on the Growth of Giant Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) represent the largest individual astrophysical structures, rivalling galaxy clusters in physical extent. Understanding how they attain such scales demands examining their large scale cosmic surroundings, particularly the under explored filament environment. We quantify the three dimensional (3D) distance of GRGs from the nearest filament spine; test how this distance correlates with their growth and formation of different morphological classes; assess whether their radio jets exhibit preferred orientations relative to filament axes; and examine how filament anisotropy from spine to periphery modulates radio morphology. We employed a filament catalogue from the SDSS together with the largest GRG catalogue currently available. For each source, we measured the comoving distance to the nearest filament spine, the projected jet spine orientation angle, and quantified lobe asymmetry via the arm length ratio (ALR). These metrics trace proximity, directionality, and the impact of filamentary environment on morphology. We then compared GRGs with a control sample of small radio galaxies (SRGs) to constrain the environmental factors that regulate the attainment of giant sizes. We validated the robustness of our results via bootstrap resampling and non parametric statistical tests. Our results show that GRGs and SRGs have similar filament occupancy. By contrast, GRGs preferentially display larger alignment angles relative to filament spines, while SRG orientations are consistent with a random distribution. GRGs further show enhanced morphological asymmetry, reflected in lower ALR values than SRGs. Attainment of giant sizes is not governed by proximity to filaments; rather, it correlates with jet filament alignment. Abridged.</description>

      <title>The Drivers of the Decline in Supermassive Black Hole Growth at $z&lt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that cosmic supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth peaks at $z\approx1.5-2$, followed by a strong decline of $\approx1-1.5\,\rm dex$ toward the present day, with the comoving number density of higher-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) peaking at higher redshift (referred to as "AGN downsizing"). We leverage the best current measurements of the SMBH accretion distribution, based upon data from nine well-characterized extragalactic fields with a "wedding-cake" design, to investigate and quantify the drivers of the drastic decline in cosmic SMBH growth. The decline in the typical Eddington ratio ($\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$) of AGNs (decreasing by $\approx1.35\,\rm dex$ from $z\approx1.5-2$ to $z\approx0.2$) is the dominant driver for the broad decline in SMBH growth, rather than a shift of accretion activity to less-massive SMBHs. As $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ decreases toward lower redshift, the primary contributor to the cosmic SMBH accretion density ($\rho_\mathrm{BHAR}$) has shifted from high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ AGNs to low-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ AGNs, even though the latter always dominate the comoving AGN number density at $z&lt;4$. We also find that the decline in SMBH growth toward lower SMBH mass in less-massive galaxies is primarily due to the decreasing outburst luminosity rather than the duty cycle.</description>

      <title>The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample: IV. Multiwavelength data and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an updated 'multiwavelength' version of the G4Jy catalogue (available at https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy, https://zenodo.org/communities/g4jy/records, and through VizieR), which has 127 new host-galaxy identifications, as described in Paper III of this paper series. We also supplement the redshift information (0.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.6) gathered in Paper III with $griz$ photometry available through DR10 of the DESI Legacy Surveys. Together, this legacy dataset allows us to investigate the multiwavelength properties of these southern radio-bright galaxies, which includes an initial analysis of radio spectral-curvature for this complete sample (S_151MHz &gt; 4 Jy). For example, we present (for the first time in the literature) the radio-power--size diagram as a function of radio spectral-curvature, [P--D](SCI), noting that the spectral-curvature index (SCI) can act as a proxy for the spectral age of the radio source. This radio-power--size--age diagram shows an interesting predominance of candidate remnant radio-galaxies (SCI &gt; 0.15) with D &lt; 200 kpc (although these may instead be young radio-sources), and a vast range of linear sizes for candidate restarted radio-galaxies (SCI &lt; -0.15). We also show that (i) G4Jy sources populate the entirety of WISE colour-colour space, (ii) optically point-like sources (i.e. candidate quasars) are brighter than the well-studied K--z relation (as expected), and (iii) there is no relation between the SCI of the radio source and its host-galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Physical Properties of Young Star Clusters and Star-forming Clumps in the Brightest z&gt;6 Galaxy, the Strongly Lensed Cosmic Spear at z=6.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in the brightest $z&gt;6$ galaxy known to date (AB mag 23), the strongly lensed MACS0308$-$zD1 (dubbed the ``Cosmic Spear'') at $z_{\rm spec}=6.2$. New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of $R_{\rm{eff}} \sim 5$ pc, stellar masses of $M_{*} \sim 10^{6}-10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$, and high stellar mass surface densities of $\Sigma_{*} &gt; 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}~\rm{pc}^{-2}$. While their stellar populations are very young ($\sim 5-9$ Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm{ion}}$) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.</description>

      <title>The Two-Infall Model Revisited: Constraints on Milky Way Bulge Assembly from &gt;30,000 Galactic Chemical Evolution Models and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the formation history of the Milky Way bulge using a two-infall Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) framework implemented in the OMEGA++ code. We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: forward modelled gas-phase metallicity gradients in galaxies at $z\sim 0.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the seeing-deconvolved gas-phase metallicity gradients of 70 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 0.3$ from the MAGPI survey and investigate their relationship with galaxy properties to understand the mechanisms that influence the distribution of metals and shape the evolution of the galaxies. We use a Bayesian modelling technique, Blobby3D, which accounts for seeing effects (beam smearing) and can model the substructures of the flux distribution. The median metallicity gradient of our sample is $\nabla \mathrm{[O/H]}=-0.013^{+0.059}_{-0.033}$ dex/kpc. Among the galaxies in our sample, 32.9% have negative metallicity gradients (2$\sigma$ significance), 10.0% have positive gradients and 57.1% have flat gradients. The $\nabla \mathrm{[O/H]}$-$M_*$ relation of the MAGPI galaxies generally agrees with theoretical predictions, where a combination of stellar feedback, gas transport, and accretion shapes the metallicity profile, with the dominant processes varying with galaxy mass. We find a positive correlation between $\nabla \mathrm{[O/H]}$ and gas velocity dispersion ($r=0.36$), indicating that stronger gas turbulence is associated with flatter or inverted metallicity gradients, likely due to enhanced gas mixing. Additionally, smaller galaxies tend to have flatter or positive gradients, suggesting that metal dilution by gas accretion or removal via feedback-driven winds may outweigh metal enrichment in small galaxies.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Holes with High Accretion Rates in Active Galactic Nuclei. XV. Reverberation Mapping of Mg II Emission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the 15th paper in a series reporting on a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present the results of measurements of the Mg II lines in 18 SEAMBHs monitored spectroscopically from 2017 to 2024. Among these, the time lags of Mg II have been successfully determined for 8 of the 18 objects, thereby expanding the current Mg II RM sample, particularly at higher accretion rates. By incorporating measurements of the line widths, we determine the masses of their central supermassive black holes. Based on these new measurements, we update the relation between the Mg II radius and the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 $\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ ($R_{\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation), yielding a slope of $0.24 \pm 0.03$, which is slightly shallower than, yet still consistent with, previously reported values. Similar to the H$\beta$ lines, the Mg II time lags in SEAMBHs are shorter than those of AGNs with normal accretion rates at comparable luminosities. The deviation of AGNs from the best-fit $R_{\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation shows a strong correlation with the accretion rate, while no significant correlation is found between the deviation and the flux ratio of UV iron to Mg II.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting Survey: Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first data release (DR1) of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, a mapping in the J=(1-0) transition lines of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O toward the northern Galactic plane during 2011-2022. The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =&lt; l=&lt; 229.75 deg and |b| =&lt; 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Chemical analysis of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster: Evidence for a metallicity gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) is located together with its surrounding nuclear stellar disc (MWNSD) in the Galactic centre and they dominate the gravitational potential within the inner 300\,pc. However, the formation and evolution of both systems and their possible connections are still under debate. We reanalyse the low-resolution KMOS spectra in the MWNSC with the aim to improve the stellar parameters ($\rm T_{eff}$, $\rm \log\,g$, and $\rm [M/H])$ for the MWNSC. We use an improved line-list, especially dedicated for cool M giants allowing to improve the stellar parameters and to obtain in addition global $\rm \alpha$-elements. A comparison with high-resolution IR spectra (IGRINS) gives very satisfactory results pinning down the uncertainties to $\rm T_{eff} \simeq 150\,K$, $\rm log\,g \simeq 0.4\,dex$, and $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.2\,dex$. Our $\rm \alpha$-elements agree within 0.1\,dex compared to the IGRINS spectra. We obtain a high-quality sample of 1140 M giant stars where we see an important contribution of a metal-poor population ($\rm \sim 20\,\%$) centered at $\rm [M/H] \simeq -0.7\,dex$ while the most dominant part comes from the metal-rich population with $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.26\,dex$. We construct a metallicity map and find a metallicity gradient of $\rm \sim -0.1 \pm 0.02 \,dex/pc$ favouring the inside-out formation scenario for the MWNSC.</description>

      <title>Photochemistry of interstellar ice forming Complex Organic Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrochemistry is a well-established multidisciplinary field devoted to study molecules in space. While most astrochemists are oriented to observe molecules in the gas phase and reproduce their abundances by modeling the physical conditions of the medium, the microscopic dust particles wandering in the interstellar medium deserve the attention of a smaller community. Radiation and thermally-driven processes taking place in the bare dust, and particularly in dust particles covered by ice mantles, are mimicked in the laboratory. In addition to water, interstellar ice contains other simple species. In this Review we present our current knowledge on ice photochemistry and thermal processing that ultimately leads to formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). Numerous COMs are of astrobiological interest and match those present in comets and asteroids. Upon impact of these minor bodies, water and COMs were delivered to the earth and might have intervened in the first prebiotic reactions.</description>

      <title>Collisional rate coefficients for OH-H$_2$ at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OH is a cornerstone molecule in the chemistry of interstellar and circumstellar media and is ubiquitously detected in warm gas thanks to its infrared rotational lines. However, the excitation processes of OH remain poorly characterized. We provide a new set of collisional rate coefficients for OH with H$_2$, expanding the existing data to $j$ levels up to $j=15/2$ and temperatures up to 750 K. These rate coefficients are obtained from state-to-state collision cross sections calculated by means of well-converged close-coupling quantum scattering calculations for collisions of OH with para- and ortho-H$_2$ with energies up to 1700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\simeq 2450$ K). We reproduce the rate coefficients computed by Klos et al. (2017) and extend their results to higher temperatures and higher rotational levels of OH. The de-excitation rate coefficients are lower in collisions with para-H$_2$ ($j_{\rm H_2} = 0$) due to the absence of a quadrupole moment, but this difference decreases at higher temperatures. We find that the rate coefficients follow scaling relations with the energy gap between the upper and lower levels of a given transition, which allows extrapolation to higher OH rotational states $j_{\rm OH}$. As a first application, we show that under astrophysical conditions typical of warm and dense gas around nascent stars, the populations of low-$j_{\rm OH}$ states are dominated by collisions, even when chemical pumping is included. The full set of rate coefficients is made available in the LAMDA database.</description>

      <title>Globular Cluster Systems in Dwarf Galaxies: Catalogs and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between a galaxy's total globular cluster system (GCS) mass and its halo mass has been studied for decades and it has been found that galaxies at nearly all observed masses adhere to a linear scaling relation between these properties. However, while we have ample, homogeneous data for galaxies with halo masses $M_h \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ the data available for low-mass galaxies is more sparse, and both GCS mass and halo mass estimates are determined using varying methodologies. This work compiles all available literature data for dwarf galaxies with confident stellar mass and GC count estimates, and converts these estimates to GCS masses and peak halo masses using a standard conversion. This allows for a consistent comparison of these masses to be made and a complete study of the behaviour of the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation to be conducted. We compare the positions of classical dwarfs on the scaling relation to that of ultra diffuse galaxies and extremely low-surface brightness galaxies and find that these non-classical dwarfs have, on average, systematically higher GC specific frequencies. This also makes them, on average, systematically positively offset from the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation, driving much of the high-$M_{GCS}$ scatter observed.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: First Identification, Physical Properties and Ionization Efficiency of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) are key tracers of intense star formation and potential analogues of the sources that reionized the early Universe. Their low-redshift counterparts offer a unique opportunity to study the physical conditions that enable high ionizing-photon escape fractions. We present a robust method to photometrically identify EELGs in the J-PAS survey, which provides 56 optical bands over 8500 deg^2. Using data from a fully observed 30 deg^2 region, we combine narrow-band equivalent widths with machine-learning techniques to select galaxies with emission lines above 300 {\AA}. The method achieves 95% purity and 96% completeness for $i_\mathrm{SDSS}&lt;22.5$ mag. We identify 917 EELGs up to $z=0.8$; spectroscopic cross-matching with DESI/DR1 confirms the reliability of our redshifts and emission-line measurements. The selected galaxies show strong correlations between $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ and EW([OIII]), consistent with previous low- and high-z studies. Most sources exceed the ionizing efficiency threshold required for reionization, reinforcing their role as local analogues of early-Universe galaxies.</description>

      <title>Investigating ionising sources and the complex interstellar medium of GHZ2 at $z=12.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate characterisation of the physical properties of galaxies at cosmic dawn is key to understanding the origin of the high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z$\gtrsim$10. We exploit deep NIRSpec PRISM observations of GHZ2 to constrain the sources of ionising radiation and the properties of the ISM in this bright, compact, and highly ionising galaxy at z=12.3. We measure with high significance the prominent N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III emission features previously detected in shallower observations, and confirm the detection of the N III] $\lambda 1750$ multiplet, yielding tight constraints on the N/O ratio, which is found to be $\simeq$2 times the solar value. We also detect the Mg II $\lambda 2800$, [Fe IV] $\lambda 2833$ and Si II $\lambda 1812$ doublets, the H8+HeI $\lambda\lambda 3889$ blend, and the Si IV+O IV] $\lambda\lambda 1400$ absorption complex. The O III $\lambda 3133$ fluorescence line is only detected in the first observing epoch, implying variability on a rest-frame time span of 19 days, strongly suggesting the presence of an active nucleus. Combining the NIRSpec dataset with available optical and far-infrared constraints from MIRI and ALMA, we show that the emission spectrum of GHZ2 cannot be reproduced by single-density spectro-photometric models. Multi-zone photoionisation modelling performed with the HOMERUN code demonstrates that star formation must be occurring in a strongly stratified ISM, where both low-/intermediate-density gas and high-density regions (log($n_e$/cm$^{-3}) \gtrsim 4$) coexist. The GHZ2 emission landscape is consistent with either a composite star-formation plus AGN scenario, or with star formation occurring in a combination of radiation- and matter-bounded regions. Purely radiation-bounded stellar models fail to reproduce the observed He II emission, making an additional hard ionising component unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Measuring the diffuse Galactic synchrotron spectral index and curvature between 45 and 2300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-sky map of the synchrotron spectral index and curvature between 45 and 2300 MHz at a resolution of 1 degree calculated from a combination of numerous partial sky empirical measurements. We employ a least-squares parametric fit which relies on removing a free-free emission template and a component separation technique which fits for both synchrotron and free-free emission. We compare our diffuse sky model estimates against those derived from the models widely used in the community (e.g. pysm3 and GSM) employing external datasets that were not included in the estimation process. Our evaluation focuses on identifying the enhanced consistency at both the map level and in pixel-to-pixel correlations, allowing for a more robust verification of our model's performance. We find our parametric, least-squares synchrotron estimate to be the most reliable across radio frequencies as it consistently provides sky models with average accuracies (when compared to empirical data) of around 20 per cent, whilst other model performances range on average between 10 and 70 per cent accurate. The results obtained have been made publicly accessible online and can be utilized to further develop and refine models of Galactic synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Galactic Outflows: Orientation Effects, Kinematics, and Metallicity in TNG50 and SERRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.</description>

      <title>HI-detected Dwarf Galaxies in the FASHI Survey: Insights from Single- and Double-Peaked Emission-Line Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of low HI mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\rm HI} &lt; 10^8 M_\odot$) detected by The FAST All Sky HI Survey (FASHI) project. Due to the faint and irregular morphology of these galaxies, the default photometry is often inaccurate. Therefore, we utilized The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data to perform careful photometric measurements, and find that the low HI mass galaxies have similar stellar mass densities to dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. Compared to other dwarf galaxy populations, the HI-selected dwarfs exhibit higher stellar mass densities than ultradiffuse galaxies, and similar densities to HI-selected low-surface-brightness galaxies, albeit with lower stellar masses, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection among these populations. By classifying the galaxies according to their HI spectral-line profiles, we show that the double-peaked sources conform closely to the Tully-Fisher relation, whereas the single-peaked sources follow the Faber-Jackson relation but with large scatter. This indicates that the single-peaked systems are likely dispersion dominated and that the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass in such systems may remain consistent across both low- and high-mass regimes. These findings suggest that HI-selected dwarf galaxies with single-peaked HI profiles may share a similar dynamical state with massive ellipticals, offering new insights into their structural evolution and the diversity of formation pathways for low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Quasar Counts Detectable in the LSST Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), being conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is a wide-field multi-band survey that will revolutionize our understanding of extragalactic sources through its unprecedented combination of area and depth. While the LSST survey strategy is still being finalized, the Rubin Observatory team has generated a series of survey simulations using the LSST Operations Simulator to explore the optimal survey strategy that best accommodates the majority of scientific goals. In this study, we utilize the latest simulated data to predict the number of detectable quasars by LSST in each band and evaluate the impact of different survey strategies. We find that the number of quasars and lower luminosity AGNs detected in the baseline strategy (v4.3.1) in the redshift range z=0.3-6.7 will be highest in the i-band and lowest in the u-band. Over 70% of quasars are expected to be detected within the first year in all bands, as LSST will have already reached the break of the luminosity function at most redshifts. With a limiting magnitude of 25.7 mag, we expect to detect 184 million AGNs in the z-band over the 10-year survey, with quasars constituting only 6% of the total AGNs in each band. This arises because, considering that the luminosities of most low-luminosity AGNs are affected by contamination from their host galaxies, we set a magnitude threshold when predicting the number of quasars. We find that variations in the u-band strategy can impact the number of quasar detections. Specifically, the difference between the baseline strategy and that with the largest total exposure in u is 15%. In contrast, changes in rolling strategies, DDF strategies, weather conditions, and Target of Opportunity observations result in variations below 2%. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing approaches to maximize the scientific output of quasar studies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Infall Time of Milky-Way Satellites via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of dwarf galaxies provide essential insight into galaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe. Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $\tau_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Euclid spectroscopy of QSOs. 1. Identification and redshift determination of 3500 bright QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slitless spectroscopy mode of the NISP onboard Euclid has enabled efficient spectroscopy of objects within a large FoV. We present a large and homogeneous sample of bright quasars identified from the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) by combining high-purity candidate selections from Gaia and WISE with the NISP spectra. Through visual inspection of the Euclid spectra of these quasar candidates, we identify approximately 3500 quasars with reliable redshifts at $0&lt;z\lesssim 4.8$. We generate the first Euclid composite spectrum of quasars covering rest-frame NUV to NIR wavelengths without telluric lines, which will be pivotal to NIR quasar spectral analysis. We obtain an empirical spectroscopic depth of $J_{\rm E}\lesssim 21.5$ and $H_{\rm E}\lesssim 21.3$ at the sensitivity of the Wide Field Survey, beyond which the number of securely identified quasars declines sharply. We analyse VIS morphologies using Sersic and CAS metrics, and a deep-learning PSF fraction to track nuclear dominance. At low redshift ($z&lt;0.5$), obvious host structures are common and a single Sersic model fits about half of the sources; at intermediate redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;2$), the nuclear component dominates, with 90% of the Sersic fits saturating at the upper index limit. In this intermediate redshift regime, $f_{\rm PSF}$ is available, and we use it as a more reliable compactness measure than the single-Sersic and CAS parameters to quantify nuclear versus host emission. We also explore the novel Euclid NIR colour space and discuss the role of these quasars in refining AGN selection techniques for future Euclid data releases. Our results highlight the potential of Euclid spectroscopy to advance quasar surveys and enable the construction of more complete AGN catalogues. The spectroscopic bright quasar catalogue of this work, and the composite quasar spectrum, will be available at https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/. (abridged)</description>

      <title>FIRESTORM I: Stellar Feedback and Gas Kinematics in the Evolved W40 Hub-Filament System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FIRESTORM project--Feedback-Induced Regions and Emission from Star-forming Tracers of ObseRvable Molecular Gas--has targeted four star-forming regions to quantify the impact of stellar feedback on star formation. In this paper, we present multiwavelength results for one of the targets, the nearby high-mass star-forming region W40. Using dense-gas tracers C$^{18}$O(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), we identified six velocity-coherent filaments: five at \vlsr $\sim$\,7.5\kms\! and one at \vlsr $\sim$\,5\kms. Four of these converge towards an infrared-bright cluster hosting the most massive star of the region (IRS 1A South, O9.5V), forming a hub-filament system (HFS). Key physical parameters, including filament lengths, widths, masses, velocity dispersions, and line masses, are derived. Five dense clumps traced by N$_2$H$^+$(1--0) exhibit subsonic to transonic turbulence, contrasting with the supersonic motions of their parental filaments, indicating turbulence dissipation. A deficit of emission at \vlsr $\sim$\,7\kms\! in several molecular lines, along with a blueshifted absorption dip in the HCN(1--0) profile, suggests that emission from OB-heated gas is being absorbed by a cold foreground cloud. A bridge-like feature in position-velocity space connects the \vlsr $\sim$\,5 and $\sim$\,7.5\kms\! filaments, and spatially coinciding with dense condensations and radio continuum peaks. These findings suggest that a past interaction--likely a cloud-cloud collision--triggered the formation of HFS and ultimately the central massive cluster.</description>

      <title>Core-halo scaling relations in self-interacting scalar field dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of self-interactions on the structure and evolution of scalar field dark matter (SFDM) halos. Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.</description>

      <title>The interstellar signature: A computational framework for open source interstellar tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.
  Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.
  As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a "Linux for the space race," aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.
  Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of AGB Mass Transfer in Gaia White Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous abundance analysis of 160 main-sequence stars in astrometric white-dwarf + main-sequence (WD+MS) binaries with orbits from Gaia DR3. These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 40 barium dwarfs -- 36 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\rm C_2$ absorption bands, linking them to CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries as a powerful laboratory for constraining binary mass-transfer physics and the origins of chemically peculiar stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new analytical solutions for the dynamics of planetary nebulae. These equations consider the temporal variation of the mechanical luminosity as well as the common envelope evolution scenario. By comparing a database of nebulae with these solutions, a large portion of planetary nebulae can be better explained by the common envelope evolution scenario, especially the fast and slow ones. Single AGB stellar models can only reproduce nebulae with expansion velocities between 20 and 30 km/s.</description>

      <title>Noble gravitational atoms: Self-gravitating black hole scalar wigs with angular momentum number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in a quasi-stationary approximation that describe self-gravitating scalar field configurations around a black hole, including angular momentum number $\ell$. An approach analogous to the one which gives rise to $\ell$-boson stars is used here to construct self-gravitating ``gravitational atoms" with $\ell\ge0$. We refer to these new solutions as {\it noble gravitational atoms}, by analogy with noble atoms, which are characterized by closed electron shells. We show that, in the proper limit, noble gravitational atoms approach $\ell$-boson stars globally, displaying noticeable differences only in a region very close to the event horizon. Noble gravitational atoms with $\ell&gt;0$ sometimes present density maxima located at relatively large radii, with small density close to the horizon for $\ell&gt;1$. Furthermore, they do not always present the typical density spike at the event horizon if $\ell &gt; 0$; on the contrary, they sometimes exhibit a small dip there. When $\ell=0$, a spike can appear, but its contribution to the total mass density is always negligible. The size, density, and lifetime of these objects vary significantly depending on the parameters, being in some cases as large as galaxies, as dilute as dark matter, and as long-lived as the Universe itself.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive(SOMA)Radio Survey. III. Radio Emission from Intermediate-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from Very Large Array (VLA) radio continuum observations of twelve intermediate-mass (IM) protostars, as part of the \textit{SOFIA} Massive Star Formation Survey. Using these observations, we studied their morphology, multiplicity and radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Across our target regions, we resolve multiple compact sources and report eight new detections, four of which are entirely new and four that have counterparts at other wavelengths, but are detected here for the first time at radio frequencies. Based on radio morphologies and spectral indices, we assess the nature of the detected sources, highlighting seven that display jet-like structures and spectral indices consistent with ionized jets. Combining our results with the SOMA Radio I and II results, we expand the overall sample to 29 protostars, covering a bolometric luminosity range from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^2$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. These sources help define a potential evolutionary sequence in the radio versus bolometric luminosity diagram. IM protostars have radio luminosities that are lower than expected from a simple power law extrapolation from low-mass protostars. However, this result is consistent with theoretical expectations from protostellar evolution models, which show low levels of photoionization and reduced shock ionization emission due to expanded stellar radii during this phase. Overall our expanded SOMA Radio sample provides new constraints on theoretical models of massive protostellar evolution, especially the connection to ionized gas structures.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries V: systematic searches in LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has now seen first light, and over a 10 year duration, LSST is projected to catalogue tens of millions of quasars, many of which are expected to be associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Out of these SMBHBs, up to thousands of relatively massive binary-quasars are expected to exhibit gravitational self-lensing flares (SLFs) that last for at least 20-30 days. We assess the effectiveness of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram and matched filters (MFs) as methods for systematic searches for these binaries, using toy-models of hydrodynamical, Doppler, and self-lensing variability from equal-mass, eccentric SMBHBs. We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF. We find that periodograms of SLF+DRW light-curves do not have maximum peak heights that could not arise from DRW-only periodograms. On the other hand, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can distinguish SLFs from noise even with LSST-like cadences and DRW noise. Furthermore, we develop a three-step procedure with matched filters, which can also recover injected binary parameters from these light-curves. We expect this method to be computationally efficient enough to be applicable to millions of quasar light-curves in LSST.</description>

      <title>Pulsars identified in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey at 144 MHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the astrometric identification of 80 known radio pulsars as unresolved continuum sources detected at 144 MHz in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), which covers 27% of the Northern hemisphere. These identifications represent the majority ($\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($\delta&gt;0^\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $\delta&gt;24^\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\gamma$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczy\'{n}ski curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.</description>

Abstract: SBS~0335-052E is a young star-forming dwarf galaxy with a total stellar mass of $M_{*} \lesssim 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ and an extremely low metallicity ($Z \sim 1/40~Z_{\odot}$), which has long been considered to be devoid of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Here we report the detection of temporal flux variability of SBS~0335-052E in near-infrared (NIR) 3-4\ ${\rm \mu}$m bands on timescales of several years, showing dimming and brightening of up to 50\% over 14~years, based on archival data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival ultraviolet (UV)-NIR photometry, including AGN SED models, indicates that the variable NIR emission arises from an edge-on AGN dust torus. The UV-optical emission from the accretion disk is obscured and does not reach us, leading to the dominance of the host galaxy's young stellar population in the UV-optical wavelengths. This analysis favors the presence of a Compton-thick, heavily obscured AGN in SBS~0335-052E, consistent with its observed X-ray weakness. From the SED fitting, we estimate an AGN bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 1.2\times10^{43}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$, which implies a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} \simeq 10^{5}\ M_\odot$ if the AGN is accreting at the Eddington limit. If confirmed, SBS~0335-052E would be the least massive galaxy known to host an AGN, likely harboring an intermediate-mass black hole.</description>

      <title>Andromeda's tenuous veil: A likely Milky Way nebula projected toward M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and H$\alpha$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre, as well as high spectral resolution spectroscopy (R~5000) at four locations within the region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007, H$\beta$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding velocities are above $-$40 km s$^{-1}$, far from the systemic velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^{-1}$). The fluxes and velocities are consistent for the same lines across different regions of the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an interstellar gas filament with an additional source of ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex properties of this object call for further observations to confirm its nature.</description>

      <title>Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multi-depth datasets with selection effects: A case study for $3&lt;z&lt;5$ Lyman $\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of object by jointly modelling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g. in luminosity) and can be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validated the model using mock catalogues; from this we determined that deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity ($\tilde{L}^\star$) are essential to reducing biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex) and that wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As a proof of concept, we considered a combined sample of 1176 Lyman $\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with the results of studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Lyman $\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.</description>

      <title>Testing stellar yield prescriptions in OMEGA+: Implications for rising sodium abundances in young thick disc stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic young thick disc ($-0.3 &lt; \mathrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; +0.3$) at super-Solar metallicity in data from the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. In this work, we investigate the origin of this unexplained sodium enrichment ([Na/Fe] $\approx 0$--$0.6$~dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We explore the rise of [Na/Fe] using four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, considering contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type~Ia supernovae. Our analysis focuses on two possible drivers of the Na enhancement: a metallicity-dependent increase in Na production from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicities, and enrichment from metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type~Ia supernova yields, one assuming exclusively Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and the other assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type~Ia explosion scenario has little influence on the resulting [Na/Fe] evolution, and that all chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed Na enrichment in the young thick-disc population at super-Solar metallicity. Our results suggest a possible ``under-pollution effect'' by Type~Ia supernovae -- the dominant producers of iron -- in the Solar-type stellar population of the Galactic disc. These findings provide a step toward understanding the origin of the anomalous sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Hiding behind a curtain of dust: Gas and dust properties of an ultra-luminous strongly-lensed z = 3.75 galaxy behind the Milky Way disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of J154506, a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud, and characterisation of its physical properties using a combination of new and archival data, including VLT/MUSE and FORS2 optical data. We identify two high-significance (SNR&gt;5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively in the spectral scans from the Atacama Compact Array and the Large Millimeter Telescope and the [CII] 158~$\mu$m fine-structure line at 400~GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. These detections yield a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm{spec}}=3.7515\pm0.0005$. We also report the detection of [CI], HCN(4-3), and two H$_2\rm{O}^+$ transitions, further confirming the redshift and providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling sub-arcsecond resolution (0.75) ALMA Band 6 and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor of $6.0\pm0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust (37K) in a starburst ($\sim900~\rm{M}_{\odot}yr^{-1}$) galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass ($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer modeling of the joint dust SED and CO line excitation suggests the dust continuum emission is primarily associated with relatively diffuse regions with molecular gas densities of $10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$, rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts or AGNs. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and gas kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms. The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly denser molecular gas.</description>

Abstract: We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Molecular Hydrogen in High-redshift Damped Lyman-{\alpha} Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations predict that circumgalactic hydrogen gas surrounding massive ($M_{\rm{halo}}^{z=1}=10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z\sim4$ may be predominantly neutral, and could produce damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) along sight-lines to background quasars \citep{Stern2021}. A circumgalactic medium (CGM) origin for DLAs naturally explains high redshift HI absorption-selected galaxy detections at physical separations much greater than the likely extents of the galaxy disks \citep{Neeleman2017, Neeleman2019}. The observed $z\sim 4$ DLA HI column densities are large and comparable to interstellar (ISM) gas columns at which substantial molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) abundances occur. We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of high-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame) far-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an analytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model with zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies. We include dust absorption and scattering computations for the transfer of photodissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) band radiation. We find that the typical extents of detectable H$_2$ sightlines are $\approx 0.1\, R_{\rm vir}$, independent of redshift from $z=2.5$ to 5. We argue that a CGM origin for DLAs naturally explains the low detection rates of H$_2$ in DLA observations, as the low CGM densities and relatively strong far-UV fields lead to molecular fractions much lower than observed in the ISM at comparable HI columns.</description>

      <title>CECILIA: Gas-Phase Physical Conditions and Multi-Element Chemistry at Cosmic Noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z$\sim$2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new $\sim$30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O$^+$ and S$^{2+}$ ions. We find that n$_e$[O II] and n$_e$[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n$_e$ in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T$_e$[O II] and T$_e$[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T$_e$ scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)$=$7.76-8.81 (12-131% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T$_e$ (T$_e$[O II]$\approx$6500 K) measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations demonstrate that exceptionally deep JWST spectroscopy can unveil the multi-element ISM abundance patterns in typical high-z galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Story of Chemical Evolution in Local Star-Forming Nuclear Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC 7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar. Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include contributions of very young stars ($&lt;6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of extinction are detected.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</title>

Abstract: Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.42$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.10$\pm$0.01. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.54$\pm$0.05 and -0.45$\pm$0.05, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</description>

Abstract: We present a catalogue of 5306 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. A total of 546 objects have been spectroscopically confirmed, including 329 L dwarfs and 26 T dwarfs. We also provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}&gt;2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. We discuss Euclid's capability to identify UCD candidates based on its photometric passbands. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least $300\,000$ L dwarfs, and more than 2600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work.</description>

      <title>Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.</description>

      <title>Inferring Mbh-Mbulge Evolution from the Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass scaling relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background (GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 10^11 Msun at z &gt; 1). When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as alpha(z) = alpha_0 (1 + z)^(1.04 +/- 0.5).</description>

      <title>Disentangling Multiple Gas Kinematic Drivers in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.</description>

      <title>Exact Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity: their thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-derive an exact analytic three-parameter expressions for the non-rotating metric, describing a Taub-NUT-like black hole (BH), and its associated bumblebee field that are solutions to the Einstein-bumblebee gravity. We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not affect its thermodynamic topological classification.</description>

      <title>Einstein gravity extended by a scale covariant scalar field with Bekenstein term and dynamical mass generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under carefully chosen assumptions a single general relativistic scalar field is able to induce MOND-like dynamics in the weak field approximation of the Einstein frame (gauge) and to modify the light cone structure accordingly. This is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (``aquadratic'') term and a second order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry V: A Sample of HST-Observed Strong Lenses Modeled with GIGA-Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} &lt; 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.</description>
