      <title>Temperature overshooting in the Mpemba effect of frictional active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Mpemba effect refers to an anomalous cooling phenomenon when an initial hotter system cools down faster than an initial warm system. Such counterintuitive behavior has been confirmed and explored across phase transitions in condensed matter systems and also for colloidal particles exposed to a double-well potential. Here we predict a frictional Mpemba effect for a macroscopic body moving actively on a surface governed by Coulomb (dry) friction. For an initial high temperature, relaxation towards a cold state occurs much faster than that for an intermediate initial temperature, due to a large temperature overshooting in the latter case. This frictional Mpemba effect can be exploited to steer the motion of robots and granules.</description>

      <title>Run-and-Tumble Particles Learning Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through evolution, bacteria have developed the ability to perform chemotactic motion in order to find nourishment. By adopting a machine learning approach, we aim to understand how this behavior arises. We consider run-and-tumble agents able to tune the instantaneous probability of switching between the run and the tumble phase. When such agents are navigating in an environment characterized by a concentration field pointing towards a circular target, we investigate how a chemotactic strategy may be learned starting from unbiased run-and-tumble dynamics. We compare the learning performances of agents that sense only the instantaneous concentration with those of agents having a short-term memory that allows them to perform temporal comparisons. While both types of learning agents develop successful target-search policies, we demonstrate that those achieved by agents endowed with temporal comparison abilities are significantly more efficient, particularly when the initial distance from the target is large. Finally, we also show that when an additional length scale is imposed, for example by fixing the initial distance to the target, the learning agents can leverage this information to further improve their efficiency in locating the target.</description>

      <title>Cohesion mediated layering in sheared grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider pattern formation in a sheared dense mixture of cohesive and non-cohesive grains. Our findings show that cohesive grains, which would typically form distributed agglomerates, instead segregate into percolating stripes or layers when the cohesive grain concentration ($c_o$) and cohesion strength ($C$) increase -- in a way that the average agglomerate size and the average normal stress collapse onto a single curve when plotted against $c_oC$. Our central proposal is that the development of interfaces between cohesive and non-cohesive grains is akin to phase separation in binary molecular mixtures driven by an effective free energy, although we are dealing with a non-equilibrium system; we setup the segregation flux such that the effect of this free energy is activated only upon application of the external driving. By constructing the segregation flux proportional to the gradient of the variational derivative of the free energy, we closely reproduce the layering in the steady-state limit. We find a robust correspondence between the parameter $c_o C$ in the discrete simulations and the parameters in the free energy.</description>

      <title>Active Filaments on Curved Surfaces: From Single Filaments to Dilute Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature plays a central organizational role in active polymer dynamics. Using large-scale Langevin-dynamics simulations, we study active semiflexible filaments confined to smooth curved surfaces and map how curvature, bending rigidity, and activity interact. We find geodesic alignment, curvature lensing, and curvature-induced trapping. In particular, regions of negative Gaussian curvature localize filaments and hinder global surface exploration. These results show how surface geometry can be used to control the organization and transport of active matter on curved substrates</description>

      <title>Interface crossing behavior of prolate microswimmers: thermo and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments of motile bacteria crossing liquid-liquid interfaces of isotropic- nematic coexistence (Cheon et al., Soft Matter 20: 7313-7320, 2024), we study the dynamics of prolate microswimmers traversing clean liquid-liquid interfaces. Using large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations, we observe that neutrally wetting swimmers can be either trapped or cross the in- terface, depending on their initial angle, swimming speed and the interfacial tension between the two fluids. The simulation results are rationalized by considering a competition between interfacial (thermodynamic) and active (hydrodynamic) forces. The swimmers get trapped at the interface due to a thermodynamic trapping force, akin to Pickering effect, when the forces from interfacial tension dominate over the swimming forces. The trapping behavior can be captured by calculating a critical capillary number by balancing the interfacial and active energies. This prediction agrees remarkably well with the numerical simulations as well as the bacterial experiments of Cheon et al., (Soft Matter 20: 7313-7320, 2024). Finally, our results demonstrate that the torque resulting in a reorientation of the swimmers parallel to the interface have both hydro and thermodynamic components.</description>

      <title>Extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in polymeric liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in viscoelastic or polymeric liquids is studied computationally. At low polymer concentration (c) and Deborah number (De), a wake of highly stretched polymers forms downstream of the particles due to larger local velocity gradients than the imposed flow, indicated by a positive deviation in local De. This increases the suspension's extensional viscosity with time and De for De less than 0.5. When De exceeds 0.5 (the coil-stretch transition), the fully stretched polymers from the far field collapse in regions with lower local velocity gradients around the particle's stagnation points, reducing suspension viscosity relative to the polymer-only liquid. The interaction between local flow and polymers intensifies with increasing c. Highly stretched polymers impede local flow, reducing local De, while it increases in regions with collapsed polymers. Initially, increasing c aligns local De and polymer stretch with far-field values, diminishing particle-polymer interaction effects. However, beyond a certain c, a new mechanism emerges. At low c, fluid three particle radii upstream exhibits increased local De, stretching polymers beyond their undisturbed state. As c increases, this deviation becomes negative, collapsing polymers and resulting in increasingly negative stress from particle-polymer interactions at large De and time. At high c, this negative interaction stress scales as c squared, surpassing the linear increase in polymer stress, making dilute sphere suspensions more effective at reducing the viscosity of viscoelastic liquids at larger De and c.</description>

      <title>Could Living Cells Use Phase Transitions to Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells. Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.</description>

      <title>Viscosity variation in fluid flows across scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of natural and engineered fluid flows exhibit spatial or temporal viscosity variations, spanning scales from microbial locomotion to planetary mantle convection. These variations introduce qualitatively new physical mechanisms absent in constant-viscosity flows. This review surveys such phenomena across scales. In low Reynolds number (Stokes) flows, viscosity gradients couple translation and rotation, enabling novel particle responses to uniform forcing-- mechanisms that microorganisms may exploit. In shear flows, viscosity variation alters base flow profiles and breaks symmetries, modifying stability and transition dynamics. At high Reynolds numbers, stratification fundamentally changes the singular perturbation structure governing energy production, enhancing or suppressing canonical instabilities and introducing new ones. Viscosity variation also affects nonnormal growth and nonlinear interactions that drive transition to turbulence. While laminar and fully developed turbulence have been extensively studied, transitional processes remain poorly understood in variable-viscosity flows. In turbulent regimes, viscosity variation impacts jets, wall-bounded flows, and mixing layers. At geophysical scales, incorporating eddy viscosity stratification in climate models may improve predictions, while in Earth's mantle, viscosity contrasts drive large-scale convection and geological evolution. Particle-laden flows, common across contexts, can generate effective viscosity stratification through inhomogeneous loading. Throughout, we highlight cases where viscosity variation alters flow behavior qualitatively, and point to open questions. This review aims to guide graduate students and researchers toward tractable, cross-disciplinary problems.</description>

      <title>Slow Relaxation and Landscape-Driven Dynamics in Viscous Ripening Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foams and dense emulsions display complex mechanical behavior, including intermittent rearrangement dynamics, power-law rheology, and slow recovery after perturbation. These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system's self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape's self-similar geometry. Lastly, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a $50\,\mu$s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schr\"odinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.</description>

      <title>Effects of knotting on the collapse of active ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to study tangentially active flexible ring polymers with different knot topologies. Simple, unknotted active rings display a transition from an extended phase to a collapsed one upon increasing the degree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the polymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing earlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this difference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly with the minimum crossing number of the knot while that of twist knots shrinks, eventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is a consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched active state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which increases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered configurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions, leading to collapse. These results show that topology yields a degree of control on the properties of active ring polymers, and can be used to tune them. At the same time, they suggest that activity might introduce a bias for torus knots, as complex twist knots cannot be formed in extended active polymers.</description>

      <title>On buoyancy in disperse two-phase flow and its impact on well-posedness of two-fluid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maxey &amp; Riley's (Phys. Fluids, vol. 26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the derived closure, even very simplistic two-fluid models are hyperbolic.</description>
