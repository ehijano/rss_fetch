      <title>Comment on "Coexistence of superconductivity and topological aspects in beryllenes", Materials Today Physics 38, 101257 (2023)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication by Li $\textit{et al.}$, two phases of beryllene - $\alpha$ and $\beta$ - were predicted to be single-gap superconductors with critical temperatures of 9.9 K and 12.6 K respectively. Moreover, the $\alpha$-beryllene was shown to host type-I Dirac fermions with the existence of nontrivial edge states. We observe significantly weaker superconducting properties of both beryllene configurations. We argue that the superconducting gap evolution with temperature, as shown in Figure 5 (b and d) of Li $\textit{et al.}$, exhibits clearly unphysical trends with increasing temperature, leading to significantly overestimated values of the critical temperature and erroneous conclusions concerning the two-gap superconducting nature of $\beta$-beryllene. On a positive note, we report the value of the gap in the Dirac cone of the topological states of interest that exceeds the temperature range of superconductivity in $\alpha$-beryllene, supporting the coexistence of topological features and superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin-charge-orbital order in superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) exhibits a remarkably high-temperature superconductivity of approximately 80 K under pressure, sparking considerable attentions. However, the nature of the spin, charge, and orbital order in LNO remains unknown, hindering the exploration of the mechanism of superconductivity. Here, supported by symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, we unravel a double strip ground state of LNO with alternating magnetic moments arrangements. Interestingly, a charge density wave emerges under this determined magnetic order. Such CDW phase exhibits a Pmnm space group with breathing deformation of the NiO$_6$ octahedra, where the stretching and shrinking of the octahedra correspond to the formation of \emph{d}$_{z^2}^1$\emph{d}$_{x^2-y^2}^1$ and \emph{d}$_{z^2}^1$ orbital order. Moreover, we build a first-principles-based Hamiltonian for LNO, which provides deeper insight into its peculiar magnetic order. Our work thus reveals a systematic spin-charge-orbital picture for LNO, which can be extended to other nickelate-based superconductors, paving the way for determining the mechanism of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of quantum vortex fractionalization in multiband superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18610v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field is expelled from a superconductor, unless it forms quantum vortices, consisting of a core singularity with current circulating around it. The London quantization condition implies that there is one core singularity per quantum of magnetic flux in single-component superconductors, while in multiband materials fractional vortices are possible. Here, we report the first observation of quantum vortex core fractionalization on the potassium terminated surface of multiband superconductor KFe2As2 by scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe splitting of an integer-flux vortex into several fractional vortices, leading to disparity between numbers of flux quanta and vortex cores. Our findings demonstrate that fractionalized core singularities are possible in a multiband superconductor, opening avenue for new experimental platforms with quasiparticles with fractional statistics.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Ballistic Majorana Nanowire Devices" by Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work re-analyzes Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018 "Ballistic Majorana nanowire devices" using fuller data from the original experiments released in 2023 on Zenodo. The authors have prepared a correction to their article that appeared in Nature Nanotechnology in 2024. However, the correction does not address the concerns we identify here. We demonstrate that the fuller data contain extensive evidence for quantum dots and disorder that are completely inconsistent with the authors' conclusion that they have achieved ballistic devices containing zero bias peaks of likely Majorana origin. We show how data selection, data cropping and undisclosed data processing played a role in composing the figures of the final published paper.</description>

      <title>Landau levels and optical conductivity in the mixed state of a generic Weyl superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy quasiparticle states in the mixed state of most superconductors remain Bloch waves due to the presence of supercurrent around vortex cores. In contrast, the Weyl superconductor (WSC) may display Dirac-Landau levels in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate the Landau level (LL) structure and optical conductivity in the mixed state of a generic WSC using a heterostructure model, where the tilt of the Bogoliubov-Weyl (BW) cones can be tuned, yielding either type-I (undertilted) or type-II (overtilted) cones. We find that, in a magnetic field, the tilted type-I BW cone in the mixed state may exhibit squeezed LLs with reduced spacings. On the other hand, the spectrum of type-II cones shows a dependence on the angle between the magnetic field and the tilt direction; LL quantization is only possible if the angle is below a critical value. For zero tilt, the optical conductivity in the mixed state of the WSC shows peaks only at photon frequencies $\omega_n \propto \sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}$, with a linear background. However, the tilt of BW cones results in the emergence of optical transitions beyond the usual dipolar ones. For type-II BW cones, unique intraband transition conductivity peaks emerge at low frequency, which can serve as an indicator to distinguish between type-I and type-II BW cones in WSCs.</description>
