      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models</description>

      <title>Frustrated Ising charge correlations in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we resolve the real-space nature of the high-temperature, short-range charge correlations in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Diffuse scattering appears along a frustrated wave vector $\textbf{q}_H=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ at temperatures far exceeding the charge order transition $T_{CO}=92~\mathrm{K}$, preempting long-range charge order with wave vectors along $\textbf{q}_{\bar{K}}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$. Using a combination of real space and reciprocal space analysis, we resolve the nature of the interactions between the primary out-of-plane Sc-Sn chain instability and the secondary strain-mediated distortion of the in-plane V kagome network. A minimal model of the diffuse scattering data reveals a high-temperature, short-ranged "zig-zag" phase of in-plane correlations that maps to a frustrated triangular lattice Ising model with antiferromagnetic interactions and provides a real-space understanding of the origin of frustrated charge order in this material.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in the ideal j=1/2 compound K$_2$IrCl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mott insulators with spin-orbit entangled j=1/2 moments host intriguing magnetic properties. The j=1/2 wave function requires cubic symmetry, while a noncubic crystal field mixes j=1/2 and 3/2 character. Spectroscopic studies of $5d^5$ iridates typically claim noncubic symmetry, e.g., based on a splitting of the excited j=3/2 quartet. A sizable splitting is particularly puzzling in antifluorite-type K$_2$IrCl$_6$, a frustrated fcc quantum magnet with global cubic symmetry. It raises the fundamental question about the stability of j=1/2 moments against magneto-elastic coupling. Combining resonant inelastic x-ray scattering with optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the multi-peak line shape in K$_2$IrCl$_6$ reflects a vibronic character of the j=3/2 states rather than a noncubic crystal field. The quasimolecular crystal structure with well separated IrCl$_6$ octahedra explains the existence of well-defined sidebands that are usually smeared out in solids. Our results highlight the spin-orbital-lattice entangled character of cubic K$_2$IrCl$_6$ with ideal j=1/2 moments.</description>

      <title>Competition of long-range interactions and noise at ramped quench dynamical quantum phase transition: The case of the long-range pairing Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of long-range pairing Kitaev model with noiseless/noisy linear time dependent chemical potential, is investigated in the frame work of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). We have shown for the ramp crosses a single quantum critical point, while the short-range pairing Kitaev model displays a single critical time scale, the long-range pairing induces a region with three DQPTs time scales. We have found that the region with three DQPTs time scales shrinks in the presence of the noise. In addition, we have uncovered for a quench crossess two critical points, the critical sweep velocity above which the DQPTs disappear, enhances by the long-range pairing exponent while decreases in the presence of the noise. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have shown that noise diminishes the long-range pairing inductions.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystals and Topological Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping carriers into a correlated quantum ground state offers a promising route to generate new quantum states. The recent advent of moir\'{e} superlattices provided a versatile platform with great tunability to explore doping physics in systems with strong interplay between strong correlation and nontrivial topology. Here we study the effect of electron doping in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator realized in TMD moir\'{e} superlatice at filling $\nu=1$, which can be described by the canonical Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. By solving the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using an unrestricted real-space Hartree-Fock method, we find that doping generates quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHC) and topological domain walls. In the QAHC, the doping induces skyrmion spin textures, which hosts one or two electrons in each skyrmion as in-gap states. The skyrmions crystallize into a lattice, with the lattice parameter being tunable by the density of doped electrons. Remarkably, we find that the QAHC can survive even in the limit of vanishing Kane-Mele topological gap for a significant range of fillings. Furthermore, doping can also induce domain walls separating topologically distinct domains with different electron densities, hosting chiral localized modes.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fractional Chern Insulators through Periodic Strain in Monolayer Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). By analyzing the tunable band structure and band geometry via strain, and performing extensive many-body exact diagonalization of a realistic model, we present compelling evidence for realizing various fractional Chern insulators in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs. Our thorough analysis across different strain parameters, accounting for experimental variability, reveals that a broad spectrum of fractional Chern insulators, including the Laughlin states, Halperin 112, 332 and 111 states, and Chern number |C| = 2 states, can be stabilized in distinct regions of the phase diagram. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Pseudomode expansion of many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expansion of a many-body correlation function in a sum of pseudomodes - exponents with complex frequencies that encompass both decay and oscillations. We demonstrate that, typically, it is enough to take a few first terms of this infinite sum to obtain an excellent approximation to the correlation function at any time, with the large time behavior being determined solely by the first pseudomode. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we apply the pseudomode expansion to calculate infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional excitations offer vast potential for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, their dynamics under the influence of gauge fields pose a significant challenge to conventional models. Here, we investigate the evolution of low-energy Majorana dispersions across various crystalline phases of the \pi-flux in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. We develop an effective tight-binding description for these low-energy Majorana fermions, introducing a gauge potential through a superexchange-like interaction that systematically eliminates the high-energy spectrum. We identify conditions under which this superexchange interaction acts as a Z2 gauge field, governing the tight-binding hopping of Majorana Wannier orbitals. Our study reveals an intriguing phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band (extensive) degeneracy. To further explore flat band physics, we introduce a mean-field theory describing a gauge-invariant Majorana density-wave order within these bands. The resulting split Chern bands facilitate the partial filling of Chern bands, effectively leading to fractional Chern states. Our work, encompassing both the gauge-mediated tight-binding model and the mean-field theory, opens doors for future exploration of $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ gauge-mediated tight-binding approach to other fractional or entangled Wannier excitations.</description>

      <title>Helical Spin Dynamics in Commensurate Magnets: a Study on Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the direct observation of a commensurate-ordered antiferromagnetic (AFM) state but incommensurate helical spin dynamics in the natural mineral brochantite Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$ through neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal magnon-like excitations with considerable dispersion along the c-axis and almost flat branches in other principal directions, indicating the strong one-dimensional character of the magnetic correlations. We experimentally observe the effect of the uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which elevates the degeneracy of the spin-wave modes shifting them in opposite directions in reciprocal space. The system has a commensurate AFM ground state, stabilized by the anisotropic symmetric Heisenberg exchange interactions, and quasi-one-dimensional chiral spin dynamics due to the antisymmetric DM interaction. Employing linear spin-wave theory, we were able to construct an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We quantify both the symmetric exchange parameters and the DM vector components in Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$ and determine the mechanism of the magnetic frustration. Our work provides detailed insights into the complex dynamics of the spin chain in the presence of uniform DM interaction.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of frustrated hard-core dipolar bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are proposed as unconventional second-order phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The nature and experimental realizations of DQCPs are crucial issues of importance. We illustrate the potential for DQCPs between the valence bond solid state and the antiferromagnetic phase to arise in optical lattices containing frustrated dipolar bosons subject to hard-core constraints. The emergence of DQCPs is comprehended through the fusion of two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. The DQCPs and the BKTs are confirmed by the finite-size scaling of ground-state fidelity susceptibilities. The numerical analysis reveals varying critical exponents of the correlation length in DQCPs and the logarithmic scaling in BKTs, respectively. This work offers a promising platform for realizing DQCPs and provides valuable insights into their nature within the framework of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poor man's Majorana Bound States (MBS) arise in minimal Kitaev chains when the parameters are fine-tuned to a sweet spot. We consider an interacting two-site Kitaev chain coupled to a single-mode cavity and show that the sweet spot condition can be controlled with the cavity frequency and the hopping between sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photon-mediated effective interactions can be used to screen intrinsic interactions, improving the original quality of the MBS. We describe experimental signatures in the cavity transmission to detect their presence and quality. Our work proposes a new way to tune poor man's MBS in a quantum dot array coupled to a cavity.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectricity in NbI$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity was originally proposed to elucidate the out-of-plane polarization generated by a specific stacking arrangement of non-polar van der Waals layers. However, the concept of sliding ferroelectricity can be generalized to more geometries. Here, the NbI$_4$ bulk is theoretical demonstrated as a quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectric material, which exhibits a polarization of $0.11$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$ perpendicular to the Nb's chains. The most possible ferroelectric switching path is found to be via the interchain sliding along the chain direction, while other paths like Peierls-dimerization of Nb pairs may also work. Moreover, its polarization can be augmented for $82\%$ by hydrostatic pressure up to $10$ GPa, beyond which NbI$_4$ becomes a polar metal. In addition, the negative longitudinal piezoelectricity is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Optimizing one dimensional superconducting diodes: Interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the non-reciprocal nature of the critical current (maximum current that a superconductor can withstand before turning into a normal metal) of a superconducting device. Here, we investigate SDE in helical superconductors with broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, focusing on a prototypical Rashba nanowire device proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subjected to external magnetic fields. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field formalism, we analyze the interplay between linear and higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC), bulk supercurrents, and external magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate that Rashba nanowires with only linear SOC can achieve incredibly large diode efficiencies &gt; 45% through the interplay of longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. Notably, higher-order SOC introduces qualitatively different behavior, enabling finite diode efficiency even in the absence of a longitudinal Zeeman field due to inherent energy dispersion asymmetry. We present a comprehensive phase diagram of the device elucidating the emergent Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state and demonstrate that proximitized Rashba nanowires offer a versatile, practical platform for SDE, with potential realizations in existing material systems. These results provide crucial insights for optimizing SDE in nanoscale superconducting devices, paving the way for next-generation dissipationless quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Mott transistor based on resistive switching in disordered V2O3 films grown on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field-induced giant resistive switching triggered by insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) is one of the promising approaches for developing a new class of electronics often referred to as Mottronics. Achieving this resistive switching by minimal external field at room temperature is of paramount research and technological interest. Mott-IMT is often associated with structural modification, which is very important for optoelectronic and actuator applications. Here, we report a giant resistive switching of about 900 % at room temperature in disordered polycrystalline V2O3-Si thin film stabilized at the IMT phase boundary and associated structural transformation under a small electric field. The increase of electron population in the a1g band under the field is responsible for the Mott gap collapse that drives the structural transition. Furthermore, we also fabricated a room temperature Mott-FET with a channel ON/OFF resistive ratio of about 15. This study provides a fundamental mechanism of the Mott-IMT in V2O3 as well as its device applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the quasiparticle behaviour in the pressure-induced high-$T_c$ phase of an iron-chalcogenide superconductor</title>

Abstract: Superconductivity of iron chalocogenides is strongly enhanced under applied pressure yet its underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a quantum oscillations study up to 45 T in the high-$T_c$ phase of tetragonal FeSe$_{0.82}$S$_{0.18}$ up to 22 kbar. Under applied pressure, the quasi-two dimensional multiband Fermi surface expands and the effective masses remain large, whereas the superconductivity displays a three-fold enhancement. Comparing with chemical pressure tuning of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, the Fermi surface enlarges in a similar manner but the effective masses and $T_c$ are suppressed. These differences may be attributed to the changes in the density of states influenced by the chalcogen height, which could promote stronger spin fluctuations pairing under pressure. Furthermore, our study also reveals unusual scattering and broadening of superconducting transitions in the high-pressure phase, indicating the presence of a complex pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shot Noise in a Dirty Marginal Fermi Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study shot noise in a two-dimensional, disordered marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) driven out of equilibrium. We consider electrons with Planckian dissipation on the Fermi surface coupled to quantum-critical bosons in the presence of disorder. In the non-interacting and strong electron-boson drag limits, MFL effects disappear and our theory reproduces known results. For the case where the bosons remain in equilibrium, inelastic scattering strongly suppresses the noise by dissipating the injected energy. Interestingly, we find that MFL effects do play a role in this regime, and give a weak enhancement on top of the otherwise strong suppression. Our results suggest that shot noise can be strongly suppressed in quantum-critical systems, and this scenario may be relevant to recent measurements in a heavy-fermion strange metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic metals taking into account the presence of substrate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We consider the altermagnet bandstructure using a 2D band Hamiltonian near the $\Gamma$ point under external magnetic field. It is shown that time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to altermagnetism, together with Rashba coupling and external magnetic field, can result in non-trivial band topology. The topological phases can be tuned by magnetic field strength and directions, and are classified by their Chern numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the charge response by computing the full optical conductivity tensor with and without magnetic field. In particular, we focus on magneto-optical responses, which are the finite-frequency analog of the Berry curvature-induced anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, using experimentally realistic parameters for RuO$_2$, we estimate the Faraday angle in the absence of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Combining complex conjugation, time-reversal, and spin symmetry projection of coupled cluster wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex conjugation symmetry breaking and restoration generate two non-orthogonal configurations at the Hartree-Fock level that can capture static correlation naturally. In conjunction with broken spin-symmetry coupled cluster theory, the symmetry-projected wave function shows good agreement with full configuration interaction in beryllium hydride insertion, lithium fluoride dissociation, and symmetric stretching of tetrahedral H$_4$. By adding spin flip projection, we can also recover time reversal symmetry in the same coupled cluster framework.</description>

      <title>Spin-Spin Correlations in the Kitaev Model at Finite Temperatures: Approximate and Exact Results via Green's Function Equation of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, defined on a honeycomb lattice, features an exactly solvable ground state with fractionalized Majorana fermion excitations, which can potentially form non-Abelian anyons crucial for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Although Majorana fermions are essential for obtaining the exact ground state, their physical interpretation in terms of spin operators remains unclear. In this study, we employ a Green's function approach that maintains SU(2) symmetry to address this issue and explore the model's finite temperature properties. Our results demonstrate that the computed temperature dependence of the correlation functions closely approximates the exact values at zero temperature, confirming the accuracy of our method. We also present several exact results concerning the spin Green's function and spin-spin correlation functions that are specific to the Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Coulomb Blockade as a Signature of the Sign-Reversing Cooper Pairing Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade occurs for electrons tunneling into nanoislands because of the quantization of charge. Here, using spectroscopy measurements of nonmagnetic islands grown on a high-Tc superconductor [one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe], we systematically investigate the dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB), which is found to reflect the Cooper pairing potential in the superconducting substrate. The tunneling spectra are acquired on single-crystalline Pb nanoislands and show a clear suppression of the tunnel current around zero bias-voltage with a gap-like structure. The observed spectral gaps can be attributed to DCB based on our comprehensive investigations, including experiments with finely varying island sizes and calculations of the spectra using the P(E) theory of DCB. Our detailed analysis suggests that the observed DCB can be related to the sign-reversing pairing potential in the 1-UC FeSe substrate below the islands. The sign reversal is furthermore revealed in a transition of the superconducting gap of FeSe from a U- to a V-like lineshape as the distance between neighboring doublet islands is decreased, indicating the presence of a nodal-like gap as expected for a sign-reversing superconductor. Our configuration of nonmagnetic nanoislands on a high-Tc superconductor for spectroscopy measurements may serve as a local, spatially sensitive, and tunable probe for detecting the sign-reversing order parameter in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Long-time properties of generic Floquet systems are approximately periodic with the driving period</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Floquet quantum system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time. Consider the space of piecewise time-independent Floquet systems with (geometrically) local interactions. We prove that for all but a measure zero set of systems in this space, starting from a random product state, many properties (including expectation values of observables and the entanglement entropy of a macroscopically large subsystem) at long times are approximately periodic with the same period as the Hamiltonian. Thus, in almost every Floquet system of arbitrarily large but finite size, discrete time-crystalline behavior does not persist to strictly infinite time.</description>

      <title>Giant anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial Mn$_{3.2}$Ge films with a cubic kagome structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first example of epitaxial Mn$_{3 + \delta}$Ge thin films with a cubic $L1_2$ structure. The films are found to exhibit frustrated ferromagnetism with an average magnetization corresponding to 0.98$~\pm~$0.06$~\mu_B$/Mn, far larger than the parasitic ferromagnetism in hexagonal Mn$_3$Ge and the partially compensated ferrimagnetism in tetragonal Mn$_3$Ge. The Hall conductivity is the largest reported for the kagome magnets with a low temperature value of $\sigma_{xy} = 1587~$S/cm. Density functional calculations predict that a chiral antiferromagnetic structure is lower in energy than a ferromagnetic configuration in an ordered stoichiometric crystal. However, chemical disorder driven by the excess Mn in our films explains why a frustrated 120$^\circ$ spin structure is not observed. Comparisons between the magnetization and the Hall resistivity indicate that a non-coplanar spin structure contributes the Hall signal. Anisotropic magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect with hysteresis up to 14 T provides further insights into this material.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>
