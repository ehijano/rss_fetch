      <title>Laning Transitions in Pattern Forming Driven Binary Systems with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary system of particles that move in opposite directions under an applied field can exhibit disordered states as well as laned states where the particles organize into oppositely moving high-mobility lanes to reduce collisions. Previous studies of laning transitions generally focused on particles with purely repulsive interactions. Here, we examine laning transitions for oppositely moving pattern-forming systems of particles with competing attractive and repulsive interactions, which in equilibrium form crystal, stripe, and bubble states. In addition to multiple types of laned states, we find jammed crystals, stripes, and bubbles, and generally observe a much richer variety of phases compared to the purely repulsive system. In the stripe forming regime, the system can dynamically reorder into oppositely moving stripes that are aligned in the direction of the drive. The bubble phase can produce strongly polarized jammed states of elongated bubbles where particles in the individual bubbles segregate to opposite sides of the bubbles. We also find disordered states, segregated laned bubble states where the bubbles pass each other in lanes, and segregated bubbles that move through one another. In the compact bubble regime, we obtain a plastic bubble state in which the oppositely driven particles remain trapped in the bubbles but the bubbles move past each other at a slow velocity due to a net imbalance in the bubble population. At higher drives, individual particles begin to jump from bubble to bubble. We show that the different phases and the transitions between them produce signatures in the velocity-force and differential mobility curves. We demonstrate that the critical force for escaping from the jammed state is nonmonotonic, with stripes exhibiting the lowest unjamming force.</description>

      <title>Rigidity transition in polydisperse shear-thickening suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear thickening suspensions of non-Brownian polydisperse particles are simulated in 2D using a discrete element method based algorithm (LF-DEM) at high packing fractions ($\phi$) and large non-dimensional stresses ($\sigma$). Rigidity analysis of the stress induced particle clusters is carried out using \textit{pebble game} algorithm for polydisperse suspensions and compared with the statistically equivalent bidisperse systems. A critical value of the packing fraction, $\phi_c$, close to the shear jamming transition, $\phi_J^{\mu}$, ($\phi_c&lt;\phi_J^{\mu}$) is obtained where rigid particle clusters begin to grow sharply. The growth is found to be characterized by a critical transition of an order parameter ($f_\text{rig}$), defined by the fraction of rigid particles which scales as, $f_\text{rig}\sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ for $\phi&gt;\phi_c$, and by the susceptibility scaling, $\chi_\text{rig}\sim|\phi-\phi_c |^{-\gamma}$, with exponents $\beta=1/8$ and $\gamma=7/4$, which are consistent with the critical exponents in 2D Ising model. The variations of $f_\text{rig}$ and $\chi_\text{rig}$ in polydisperse suspensions are found to be identical to that of the statistically equivalent bidisperse suspensions. Finite size scaling analysis shows a divergence of correlation length near $\phi_c$ following critical exponent $\nu=1.64$, consistent with the 2D continuum percolation transition. Furthermore, $\phi_c$ and $\phi_J^{\mu}$ are found to vary non-monotonically with polydispersity index and depend on the particle stiffness.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal swimming in viscoelastic granular hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study a scallop-like swimmer with reciprocally flapping wings in a nearly frictionless, cohesive granular medium consisting of hydrogel spheres. Significant locomotion is found when the swimmer's flapping frequency matches the inverse relaxation time of the material. Remarkably, the swimmer moves in the opposite direction compared to its motion in a cohesion-free granular material of hard plastic spheres. At higher or lower frequencies, we observe no motion of the swimmer, apart from a short initial transient phase. X-ray radiograms reveal that the wing motions create low-density zones, which in turn give rise to a hysteresis in drag and propulsion forces. This time-dependent effect, combined with the swimmer's inertia, accounts for locomotion at intermediate frequencies.</description>

      <title>Probing wetting properties with self-propelled droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetting phenomena are relevant in several technological applications, particularly those involving hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces. Many substrates support multiple wetting states depending on surface conditions or droplet history, a behavior known as metastability. This feature is crucial both for its theoretical complexity and for its relevance in practical applications that rely on controlling metastable states. While several experimental and computational techniques have been developed to study metastability, they tend to be complex or computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach based on concepts from active matter physics. We investigate the wetting behavior of a droplet placed on a pillared surface using a 3-state Cellular Potts model with a polarity term that mimics a self-propelled droplet. Applying this model to a pillared substrate with known metastable wetting states, we demonstrate that increasing activity enables the droplet to traverse free energy barriers, explore consecutive metastable states, and eventually suppress metastability entirely. Our results show that activity reduces the disparity between dry and wet states and provides a reliable framework for identifying and quantifying metastability through contact angle measurements.</description>

      <title>Surface-induced ordering and continuous breaking of translational symmetry in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-induced liquid crystalline phase transitions evoke fundamental interest and can provide deeper insight into the nature of low-dimensional phase transitions. Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for classical liquids without recourse to hard-core reference systems: A study of three-dimensional Lennard-Jones liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. E 104, 014124 (2021)], we developed a method for analyzing classical liquids using the functional renormalization group (FRG) without relying on a hard-core reference system. In this paper, we extend that method to three-dimensional liquids. We describe an efficient approach for performing the spatial integrals that appear in the renormalization group equations, which is essential for realizing numerical calculations in three dimensions. As a demonstration of our method, we present its application to the Lennard-Jones liquid. By calculating thermodynamic quantities and the pair distribution function near the critical point, we find that, compared with integral equation methods, the FRG approach preserves thermodynamic consistency much more effectively and more accurately reproduces the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we successfully capture characteristic phase-transition phenomena with FRG, such as the softening of pressure near the critical temperature. Our results suggest that FRG can provide a more accurate framework for describing classical liquids than conventional methods such as integral equation theories.</description>

      <title>Micro-displacement tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extended kinematics of nominally elastic continuum solids allowing one to describe their mechanical interaction with micro-scale loading devices. The main new ingredient is the concept of a micro-displacement tensor which extends the conventional description of the deforming elastic solids in terms of macroscopic displacement vectors. We show that micro-displacement tensors are particularly useful in dealing with active incompatibility acquisition and its subsequent passive relaxation. We use the proposed approach to describe the energetics of surface deposition while accounting for the presence of micro-mechanical controls.To illustrate the effectiveness of the new conceptual scheme we present two case studies: crystallization from a melt resulting in pre-stress, and winding of a coil with controlled pre-stretch.</description>

      <title>Digitization Can Stall Swarm Transport: Commensurability Locking in Quantized-Sensing Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal model for autonomous robotic swarms in one- and higher-dimensional spaces, where identical, field-driven agents interact pairwise to self-organize spacing and independently follow local gradients sensed through quantized digital sensors. We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation.</description>

      <title>PorousGen: An Efficient Algorithm for Generating Porous Structures with Accurate Porosity and Uniform Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel algorithm for generating porous structures as an alternative to the PoreSpy program suite. Unlike PoreSpy, which often produces structures whose porosity deviates from the target value, our proposed algorithm generates structures whose porosity closely matches the specified input, within a defined error margin. Furthermore, parallel computation enables efficient generation of large-scale structures, while memory usage is reduced compared to PoreSpy. To evaluate performance, structures were generated using both PoreSpy and the proposed method with parameters corresponding to X-ray ptychography experiments. The porosity mismatch in PoreSpy led to a relative error exceeding 20% in the computed gas diffusion coefficients, whereas our method reproduced the experimental values within 5%. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an efficient, high-precision approach for generating porous structures and supports reliable prediction of material properties.

      <title>Memory as activity: pattern formation in a conserved scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the concept of memory in scalar active matter systems, focusing on the collective dynamics of particles whose interactions depend on their evolutionary history rather than on their present configuration. We do so by introducing the idea of an active particle whose velocity acquires an active contribution that depends on its past trajectory suitably weighted by a memory kernel. The memory kernel is unrelated to the thermal noise acting on the particle, meaning that the particle breaks detailed balance at the microscopic level. The number density of these active particles is described by a Cahn-Hilliard equation, which typically describes passive phase separation, suitably modified to account for this particular non-equilibrium effect. Through theory and simulations we establish the novel emergent features of the model and use the example of time delayed interactions to highlight the novel pattern-forming abilities of the model.</description>

      <title>Ion transport through differently charged nanoporous membranes: from a single nanopore to multi-nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous membranes, leveraging their high-throughput characteristics, have been widely applied in fields such as molecular separation and energy conversion. Due to interpore interactions, besides the applied voltage and solution environment, the ion transport properties in porous membranes are influenced by the pore number and spacing. Here, to understand and control the transport properties of nanopore arrays, we systematically investigate the ion transport characteristics through membranes with different charge properties, pore numbers, and interpore distances. Using numerical simulations, we analyzed local ionic concentrations and electric potential in nanopore arrays containing nanopores with uniformly charged walls as well as unipolar diodes i.e., pores containing a junction between a charged zone and a neutral zone, and showed significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) for all studied cases. As the number of pores increased and the interpore spacing decreased, the enhanced interpore interactions through ICP led to a greater deviation of the total ionic current from the linear superposition of single-pore currents. Conversely, in bipolar nanopores whose walls contain a junction between positively and negatively charged zones ICP becomes negligible, and interpore interactions are substantially reduced. Furthermore, for membranes with various charge properties, the total current through nanopore arrays presents different quantitative dependence on the pore number under varying pore spacings. Our findings clarify the mechanism of interpore interactions in modulating ion transport through porous membranes, providing critical insights for designing nanofluidic devices based on nanopore arrays, such as nanopore-array sensors.</description>

      <title>Discrete Differential Geometry for Simulating Nonlinear Behaviors of Flexible Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible slender structures such as rods, ribbons, plates, and shells exhibit extreme nonlinear responses bending, twisting, buckling, wrinkling, and self contact, that defy conventional simulation frameworks. Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) has emerged as a geometry first, structure preserving paradigm for modeling such behaviors. Unlike finite element or mass spring methods, DDG discretizes geometry rather than governing equations, allowing curvature, twist, and strain to be defined directly on meshes. This approach yields robust large deformation dynamics, accurate handling of contact, and differentiability essential for inverse design and learning based control. This review consolidates the rapidly expanding landscape of DDG models across 1D and 2D systems, including discrete elastic rods, ribbons, plates, and shells, as well as multiphysics extensions to contact, magnetic actuation, and fluid structure interaction. We synthesize applications spanning mechanics of nonlinear instabilities, biological morphogenesis, functional structures and devices, and robotics from manipulation to soft machines. Compared with established approaches, DDG offers a unique balance of geometric fidelity, computational efficiency, and algorithmic differentiability, bridging continuum rigor with real time, contact rich performance. We conclude by outlining opportunities for multiphysics coupling, hybrid physics data pipelines, and scalable GPU accelerated solvers, and by emphasizing DDG role in enabling digital twins, sim to real transfer, and intelligent design of next generation flexible systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation and propulsion of suspended capsules in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of elastic capsules suspended in two-dimensional active nematic fluids using lattice Boltzmann simulations. The capsules, modeled as flexible membranes enclosing active internal regions, exhibit a rich variety of behaviors shaped by their geometry and the interplay between internal and external activity. Circular capsules with active interiors undergo persistent rotation driven by internally confined +1/2 topological defects. Axisymmetric capsules, such as boomerangs, develop directed motion along their axis of symmetry due to unbalanced active forces generated by defect distributions near their boundaries. We further show that capsule flexibility suppresses motility and rotation, as active stresses are dissipated into shape deformations. These findings reveal how shape, deformability, and defect dynamics cooperate to produce emergent motility in soft active matter, with potential applications in the design of microswimmers and drug delivery vehicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing heterogeneous, self-assembling systems is a central challenge in soft matter and biology. We present a framework that uses gradient-based optimization to invert an analytical yield calculation, tuning systems toward target equilibrium yields. We design systems ranging from simple dimers to temperature-controlled shells to polymerizing systems, achieving precise control of self- and non-self-limiting assemblies. By operating directly on closed-form calculations, our framework bypasses trajectory-based instabilities and enables efficient optimization in otherwise challenging regimes.</description>

Abstract: Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion.</description>

      <title>Active polymers translocate faster in confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms employ diverse strategies to navigate confined environments. Inspired by translocation observations on California blackworms (\textit{Lumbriculus variegatus}), we combine biological experiments and active-polymer simulations to examine how confinement and stiffness govern translocation. Active filaments translocate fastest when the channel width is comparable to their diameter, with escape time determined by propulsion speed, filament length, and channel geometry. In wider channels, activity and flexibility induce reorientation-dominated conformational changes that prolong escape. A single dimensionless ratio linking confinement to stiffness captures the transition from axis-aligned escape with short wall deflections for stiffer filaments, to reorientation-controlled motion with blob-like shapes for flexible filaments. These results provide a unified physical framework for active translocation in confinement and suggest design principles for flexible robotic filaments in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Thickness of epithelia on wavy substrates: measurements and continuous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the thickness of MDCK epithelia grown on substrates with a sinusoidal profile. We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called {\guillemotleft} healing length {\guillemotright} in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.</description>

      <title>Engineering phase-frustration induced flat bands in an aza-triangulene covalent Kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states.</description>

      <title>Cavitation onset in transient pressure fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is well known that cavitation occurs in liquids under tension, no universally accepted criterion for its onset in transient pressure fields exists. We propose a precise definition of the critical tension for cavitation in transient pressure fields that bridges the gap between quasi-static and dynamic regimes, identifying cavitation as the transition of the bubble radius to a dynamically unstable state. This threshold depends on the instantaneous state of the gas-liquid system and, when combined with an appropriate set of dimensionless parameters, yields a self-similar description of cavitation onset. Phase maps for different liquids reveal a minimum tension required for the onset of cavitation, determined by the duration of the tension event and the initial bubble size, whereby the well-known Blake threshold is the lower bound for cavitation across all conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluid-mediated approach of a deformable axisymmetric object towards a rigid substrate, focusing on how its shape influences contact formation. For low approach velocities and large Stokes numbers, we show that sharper profiles (e.g., conical) maximize contact at the center and avoid fluid entrapment, while blunter ones form central dimples that trap bubbles. We also find that the resulting pressure distributions in the presence of thin viscous films can be predicted remarkably well by classical (dry) contact mechanics. These findings reveal shape as a design parameter for contact optimization in soft matter, adhesion, and elastohydrodynamics. Finally, we also theorize the possibility of a mechanical equivalence between shape and approach velocity.</description>

Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Equations for Active Brownian Particles in the High Persistence Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the high persistence regime of non-inertial active Brownian particles (ABP), polarization becomes a relevant dynamical field. Based on a recently proposed kinetic description for ABP, we derive Navier-Stokes-like equations for the density and polarization fields in this regime. Using the Chapman-Enskog method, all transport coefficients in the equations are obtained entirely in terms of the microscopic dynamics. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous and isotropic state shows that the derived equations correctly describe the density instability associated to the motility induced phase separation. Numerical solutions of the equations in one spatial dimension show the need of an additional regularizing pressure term to saturate the system at high densities. With the inclusion of this term, the solutions illustrate in detail the clustering dynamics, with the formation of polarized regions at the interfaces, and the subsequent coarsening of domains, as well as particle accumulation in presence of gravity. Finally, the derived equations imply that, as an effect of the coupling with the polarization, damped density wave modes appear in the system which were verified with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Active particles in power-law potentials: steady state distributions and shape transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle (ABP) and run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in two dimensional power-law potentials, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle has the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. In two dimensions, we derive the exact equations for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ of ABP ($n\geq 2)$ and RTP ($n=2$), whose solutions are obtained under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is Gaussian. Both analytical and numerical results show that, in all cases, $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like shape change as a function of the trap strength. For ABP, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with the simulation results. Simulations suggest the existence of both types of shape transition in the case of RTP as well. For ABP, in the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying a transition from predominantly radial orientation to orbiting motion. In RTP, the analogous shape transition in the orientational distribution is almost absent.</description>

      <title>Sterol-induced raft-like domains in a model lipid monolayer</title>

Abstract: A two-dimensional system consisting a mixture of highly coarse-grained saturated (S-type), unsaturated (U-type) lipid molecules, and cholesterol (C-type) molecules is considered to form a model lipid monolayer. All the S-, U- and C-type particles are spherical in shape, with distinct interaction strengths. The phase behavior of the system is studied for various compositions ($x$) of the C-type particles, ranging from $x = 0.1$ to $0.9$. The results show that a structurally ordered complex is formed with the S- and C-types in the fluid-like environment of U-type particles, for $x \in \lbrace 0.5 - 0.6\rbrace$. The time-averaged hexatic order parameter $\left\langle \Psi_{6} \right\rangle$ indicates that the dynamical segregation of S- and C-types exhibits a positional order, that is found to be maximum for $x$ in the range of 0.5 - 0.6. The mean change in the free energy ($\Delta G(x)$) obtained from the mean change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and entropy ($\Delta S$) calculations suggests that $\Delta G$ is minimum for $x \sim 0.6$. A phenomenological expression for the Gibbs free energy is formulated by explicitly accounting for the individual free energies of S-,U- and C-type particles and the mutual interactions between them. Minimizing this phenomenological $G$ with respect to the C-type composition results in the optimal value, $x^* = 0.564 \pm 0.001$ for stable coexistence of phases; consistent with the simulation results and also the previous experimental observations \cite{raghavendra_effect_2023}. All these observations signify the optimal C-type composition, $x \sim 0.5 - 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Equipartition and the temperature of maximum density of TIP4/2005 water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate TIP4P/2005 water in the temperature range of 257 K to 318 K with time-steps $\delta =$ 0.25, 0.50, 2.00, and 4.00 fs. The density-temperature behavior obtained using 0.25 or 0.50 fs are in excellent agreement with each other but differ from those obtained using time-steps that have been shown earlier to lead to a breakdown of equipartition. The temperature of maximum density (TMD) is 277.15 K with $\delta t = 0.25\;\mathrm{or}\; 0.50$ fs, but is shifted to progressively lower values for longer time-steps, a trend that holds for different thermostat/barostat combinations. Enhancing the water-water dispersion interaction, as has been recommended for simulating disordered proteins in TIP4P/2005, degrades the description of the liquid-vapor phase envelope. A key takeaway from this study is that using sufficiently short time-steps ($\leq 0.5$ fs) to preserve equipartition is essential for obtaining meaningful liquid water properties and for producing reliable data to parametrize biomolecular simulation models, as correct-ensemble sampling is fundamental to ensure reproducibility across codes and simulation alogrithms.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature. Yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-Nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, resulting in chain shrinkage and enlargement of effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations can trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states, indicating an activity-induced instability of the nematic field. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrode morphology critically determines the stability and efficiency of lithium metal anodes, yet no predictive framework has explained how measurable parameters control deposition. Here we introduce the first theoretical model of electrochemical Ostwald ripening, capturing the competition between electroplating and surface-energy-driven redistribution and identifying it as the governing process behind morphology evolution in the non-dendritic regime. The framework explicitly incorporates SEI resistance, electrolyte conductivity, electrode wettability, and current density revealing the transition from 2D SEI-limited to 3D electrolyte-limited growth. The model yields analytical expressions for nucleus size, density and distribution that quantitatively reproduce independent experimental results and establishes a direct link between plating conditions, morphology, and Coulombic efficiency. By providing experimentally accessible relationships between key parameters and deposition outcomes, the framework enables predictive understanding of lithium plating and provides a broadly applicable basis for controlling electrodeposition morphology across diverse electrochemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell induced by a viscous flow, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability in viscous flow, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.</description>
