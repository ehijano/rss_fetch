      <title>Strategic Costs of Perceived Bias in Fair Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality; others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward; effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort, propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes. While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Programming Problems: A view through Set-valued Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel programming is one of the very active areas of research with many real-life applications in economics and engineering. Bilevel problems are hierarchical problems consisting of lower-level and upper-level problems, respectively. The leader or the decision-maker for the upper-level problem decides first, and then the follower or the lower-level decision-maker chooses his/her strategy. In the case of multiple lower-level solutions, the bilevel problems are not well defined, and there are many ways to handle such a situation. One standard way is to put restrictions on the lower level problems (like strict convexity) so that nonuniqueness does not arise. However, those restrictions are not viable in many situations. Therefore, there are two standard formulations, called pessimistic formulations and optimistic formulations of the upper-level problem. A set-valued formulation has been proposed and has been studied in the literature. However, the study is limited to the continuous set-up with the assumption of value attainment, and the general case has not been considered. In this paper, we focus on the general case and study the connection among various notions of solution. Our main findings suggest that the set-valued formulation may not hold any bigger advantage than the existing optimistic and pessimistic formulation.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points in Multi-Dimensional Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the extreme points of the set of incentive-compatible mechanisms for screening problems with linear utility. Our framework subsumes problems with and without transfers, such as monopoly pricing, principal-optimal bilateral trade and barter exchange, delegation and veto bargaining, or belief elicitation via proper scoring rules. In every problem with one-dimensional types, extreme points admit a tractable description. In every problem with multi-dimensional types, extreme points are dense in a rich subset of incentive-compatible mechanisms, which we call exhaustive mechanisms. Building on these characterizations, we derive parallel conclusions for mechanisms that can be rationalized as (uniquely) optimal under a fixed objective. For example, in the multi-good monopoly problem, mechanisms that uniquely maximize revenue for some type distribution are dense among all incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanisms. The proofs exploit a novel connection between menus of extreme points and indecomposable convex bodies, first studied by Gale (1954).</description>

      <title>Marketplace Operators Can Induce Competitive Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As e-commerce marketplaces continue to grow in popularity, it has become increasingly important to understand the role and impact of marketplace operators on competition and social welfare. We model a marketplace operator as an entity that not only facilitates third-party sales but can also choose to directly participate in the market as a competing seller. We formalize this market structure as a price-quantity Stackelberg duopoly in which the leader is a marketplace operator and the follower is an independent seller who shares a fraction of their revenue with the marketplace operator for the privilege of selling on the platform. The objective of the marketplace operator is to maximize a weighted sum of profit and a term capturing positive customer experience, whereas the independent seller seeks solely to maximize their own profit. We derive the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and find that it is often optimal for the marketplace operator to induce competition by offering the product at a low price to incentivize the independent seller to match their price.</description>
