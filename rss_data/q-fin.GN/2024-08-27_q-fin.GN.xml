      <title>Most claimed statistical findings in cross-sectional return predictability are likely true</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15365v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I develop simple and intuitive bounds for the false discovery rate (FDR) in cross-sectional return predictability publications. The bounds can be calculated by plugging in summary statistics from previous papers and reliably bound the FDR in simulations that closely mimic cross-predictor correlations. Most bounds find that at least 75% of findings are true. The tightest bound finds that at least 91% of findings are true. Surprisingly, the estimates in Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) imply a similar FDR. I explain how Harvey et al.'s conclusion that most findings are false stems from misinterpreting ``insignificant factor'' as ``false discovery.''</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Energy Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 83% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.77. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the QuantConnect terms.</description>
