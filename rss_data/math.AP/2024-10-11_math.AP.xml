      <title>Bounded Time Inverse Scattering for Semilinear Dirac Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a bounded time inverse scattering problem for a semilinear Dirac equation with smooth non-linearity $F(x, z)$ depending on spatial location $x$, and scattering map sending initial data at time 0 to the solution at time $T$. We showed that $F(x, z)$ can be determined on $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $|z| \leq M$ for suitable $M$ depending on scattering map, under the assumption that $\partial_z F(x, 0)$ and $\partial^2_z F(x, 0)$ are given.</description>

      <title>On the Propulsion of a Rigid Body in a Viscous Liquid Under the Action of a Time-Periodic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigid body $\mathcal{B}$ moves in an otherwise quiescent viscous liquid filling the whole space outside $\mathcal{B}$, under the action of a time-periodic force $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ of period $T$ applied to a given point of $\mathcal{B}$ and of fixed direction. We assume that the average of $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ over an interval of length $T$ does not not vanish, and that the amplitude, $\delta$, of $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ is sufficiently small. Our goal is to investigate when $\mathcal{B}$ executes a non-zero net motion; that is, $\mathcal{B}$ is able to cover any prescribed distance in a finite time. We show that, at the order $\delta$, this happens if and only if $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ satisfy a certain condition. We also show that this is always the case if $\mathcal{B}$ is prevented from spinning. Finally, we provide explicit examples where the condition above is satisfied or not. All our analysis is performed in a general class of weak solutions to the coupled system body-liquid problem.</description>

      <title>Fast reaction limit for a Leslie-Gower model including preys, meso-predators and top-predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of three reaction-diffusion equations modeling the interaction between a prey species and two predators species including functional responses of Holly type-II and Leslie-Gower type. We propose a reaction-diffusion model with five equations with simpler functional responses which, in the fast reaction limit, allows to recover the zero-th order terms of the initially considered system. The diffusive part of the initial equations is however modified and cross diffusion terms pop up.
  We first study the equilibria of this new system and show that no Turing instability appears. We then rigorously prove a partial result of convergence for the fast reaction limit (in 1D and 2D)</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate normalized solutions of a fractional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which arises in an attractive Bose-Einstein condensation consisting of $N$ bosons moving by L\'{e}vy flights. We prove that there exists a positive constant $N^*$, such that if $0&lt;N&lt;N^*$ and the L\'{e}vy index $\alpha$ closed to $2$, the fractional Gross-Pitaevskii equation admits a local minimal normalized solution $u_\alpha$ and a mountain pass solution $v_\alpha$, but there does not exist positive local minimal solution if $N&gt;N^*$ and $\alpha$ closed to $2$. We also study the asymptotic behavior of $u_\alpha$ and $v_\alpha$ as $\alpha\to 2_-$.</description>

      <title>Damping-Diffusion-Noise Interactions in the Stochastic Camassa--Holm Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the interaction between time-inhomogeneous damping, non-local diffusion, and noise on classical solutions to the Camassa--Holm equations that incorporate these additional factors. Initially, a local-in-time theory is developed, covering the existence, uniqueness, and a blow-up criterion under relatively general conditions for these interacting factors. Subsequently, we identify different conditions on the interactions between damping, diffusion, and noise that enable the global regularity and long-time behaviour of classical solutions. Notably, we demonstrate the existence of an evolution system of measures, generalising the concept of invariant measures to the time-inhomogeneous system.</description>

      <title>Correction to Doi type models for suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from microscopic $N$ particle systems, we study the derivation of Doi type models for suspensions of non-spherical particles in Stokes flows. While Doi models accurately describe the effective evolution of the spatial particle density to the first order in the particle volume fraction, this accuracy fails regarding the evolution of the particle orientations. We rigorously attribute this failure to the singular interaction of the particles via a $-3$-homogeneous kernel. In the situation that the particles are initially distributed according to a stationary ergodic point process, we identify the limit of this singular interaction term. It consists of two parts. The first corresponds to a classical term in Doi type models. The second new term depends on the (microscopic) $2$-point correlation of the point process. By including this term, we provide a modification of the Doi model that is accurate to first order in the particle volume fraction.</description>

      <title>The Bramson correction in the Fisher-KPP equation: from delay to advance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solution to the scalar Fisher-KPP equation with front-like initial data, focusing on the location of its level sets at large times, particularly their deviation from points moving at the known spreading speed. We consider an intermediate case for the tail of the initial data, where the decay rate approaches, up to a polynomial term, that of the traveling wave with minimal speed. This approach enables us to capture deviations of the form $-r \ln t$ with $r \&lt; \frac{3}{2}$, which corresponds to a logarithmic delay when $0 \&lt; r \&lt; \frac{3}{2}$ and a logarithmic advance when $r \&lt; 0$.  The critical case  $r=\frac 32$ is also studied, revealing an extra $\mathcal O(\ln \ln t)$ term. Our arguments involve the construction of new sub- and super-solutions based on preliminary formal computations on the equation with a moving Dirichlet condition. Finally, convergence to the traveling wave with minimal speed is addressed.</description>

      <title>Prandtl-Batchelor flows with a point vortex on a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we aim to construct a very weak solution to the steady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations which is affected by an external force induced by a point vortex on the unit disk. Such a solution is also the form of Prandtl-Batchelor type, i.e. the vorticity in the limit of vanishing viscosity is constant in an inner region separated from the boundary layer. Multi-scale asymptotic analysis which will capture well the singular behavior of the solution is used to construct higher order approximate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations firstly, and then stability analysis is performed for the error system, finally the existence of Prandtl-Batchelor flows with a point vortex on a disk with the wall velocity slightly different from the rigid-rotation is proved. To overcome the singularity at the origin from the point vortex and strong singular behaviors near the boundary from viscous flow, we introduce a coordinate transformation which converts a bounded singularity problem to an unbounded one, and use a new decomposition for the error and perform basic energy estimate and positivity estimate for each part of the decomposition separately. The equation in the vorticity form shall be used to deal with $L^\infty$ estimate of the vorticity error.</description>

      <title>Median filter method for mean curvature flow using a random Jacobi algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient scheme for level set mean curvature flow using a domain discretization and median filters. For this scheme, we show convergence in $L^\infty$-norm under mild assumptions on the number of points in the discretization. In addition, we strengthen the weak convergence result for the MBO thresholding scheme applied to data clustering of Lelmi and one of the authors. This is done through a strong convergence of the discretized heat flow in the optimal regime. Different boundary conditions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Neumann domains of planar analytic eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along with the partition of a planar bounded domain $\Omega$ by the nodal set of a fixed eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$, one can consider another natural partition of $\Omega$ by, roughly speaking, gradient flow lines of a special type (separatrices) of this eigenfunction. Elements of such partition are called Neumann domains and their boundaries are Neumann lines. When the eigenfunction is a Morse function, this partition corresponds to the Morse--Smale complex and its fundamental properties have been systematically investigated by Band &amp; Fajman (2016). Although, in the case of general position, eigenfunctions are always of the Morse type, particular eigenfunctions can possess degenerate critical points. In the present work, we propose a way to characterize Neumann domains and lines of an arbitrary eigenfunction. Instead of requiring the nondegeneracy of critical points of the eigenfunction, its real analyticity is principally used. The analyticity allows for the presence of degenerate critical points but significantly limits their possible diversity. Even so, the eigenfunction can possess curves of critical points, which have to belong naturally to the Neumann lines set, as well as critical points of a saddle-node type. We overview all possible types of degenerate critical points in the eigenfunction's critical set and provide a numerically based evidence that each of them can be observed for particular eigenfunctions. Alongside with [Band &amp; Fajman, 2016], our approach is inspired by a little-known note of Weinberger that appeared back in 1963, where a part of the Neumann line set, under the name of "effectless cut", was explicitly introduced and studied for the first eigenfunctions in domains with nontrivial topology. In addition, we provide an asymptotic counting of Neumann domains for a disk and rectangles in analogy with the Pleijel constant.</description>

      <title>On rough Calder\'on solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and applications to the singular set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1934, Leray proved the existence of global-in-time weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for any divergence-free initial data in $L^2$. In the 1980s, Giga and Kato independently showed that there exist global-in-time mild solutions corresponding to small enough critical $L^3(\mathbb{R}^3)$ initial data. In 1990, Calder\'on filled the gap to show that there exist global-in-time weak solutions for all supercritical initial data in $L^p$ for $2&lt; p&lt;3$ by utilising a splitting argument, blending the constructions of Leray and Giga-Kato. In this paper, we utilise a "Calder\'on-like" splitting to show the global-in-time existence of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations corresponding to supercritical Besov space initial data $u_0 \in \dot{B}^{s}_{q,\infty}$ where $q&gt;2$ and $-1+\frac{2}{q}&lt;s&lt;\min \left(-1+\frac{3}{q},0 \right)$, which fills a similar gap between Leray and known mild solution theory in the Besov space setting. We also use the Calder\'on-like splitting to investigate the structure of the singular set under a Type-I blow-up assumption in the Besov space setting, which is considerably rougher than in previous works.</description>

      <title>On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates of inverse random source problems for the wave equations by using correlation-based data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on stability estimates of the inverse random source problems for the polyharmonic, electromagnetic, and elastic wave equations. The source is represented as a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field, which is defined by its covariance operator in the form of a classical pseudo-differential operator. The inverse problem is to determine the strength function of the principal symbol by exploiting the correlation of far-field patterns associated with the stochastic wave equations at a single frequency. For the first time, we show in a unified framework that the optimal Lipschitz-type stability can be attained across all the considered wave equations through the utilization of correlation-based data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a fractional Hardy inequality in the case $Q&lt;sp$ on homogeneous Lie groups, and as an application we show the corresponding uncertainty principle. Also, we show a fractional Hardy-Sobolev type inequality on homogeneous Lie groups. In addition, we prove fractional logarithmic Hardy-Sobolev and fractional Nash type inequalities on homogeneous Lie groups. We note that the case $Q&gt;sp$ was extensively studied in the literature, while here we are dealing with the complementary range $Q&lt;sp$.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the periodic fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the periodic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $$ iu_t -(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} u + \mathcal{N}(|u|)u=0, \quad x\in \mathbb{T}^N,\, \, t \in \mathbb R, \, \, s&gt;0, $$ where the nonlinearity term is expressed in two ways: the first one $\mathcal{N}\in C^J(\mathbb R^+)$, whose derivatives have a certain polynomial decay, e.g., $\mathcal{N}(|u|)=\log(|u|)$; the second one is given by a sum of powers, possibly infinite, $$ \mathcal{N}(|u|) = \sum a_k |u|^{\gamma_k}, \quad \gamma_k \in \mathbb{R}, ~~ a_k \in \mathbb{C}, $$ which includes examples such as $\mathcal{N}(|u|) \, u =\frac{u}{|u|^{\gamma}},$ $\gamma&gt;0$. By using standard properties of periodic Sobolev spaces $H^J(\mathbb{T}^N)$, $J&gt;0$, we study the local well-posedness for the Cauchy problems of the above equations when initial data satisfy a non-vanishing condition $\inf\limits_{x\in \mathbb{T}^N}|u_0(x)|&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and H\"older estimates for the $\overline \partial$ equation on pseudoconvex domains of finite type in $\mathbb C^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a homotopy formula which yields almost optimal estimates in all (positive-indexed) Sobolev and H\"older-Zygmund spaces for the $\overline \partial$ equation on finite type domains in $\mathbb C^2$, extending the earlier results of Fefferman-Kohn (1988) and Chang-Nagel-Stein (1992), and Range (1992). The main novelty of our proof is the construction of holomorphic support functions that admit precise estimates when the parameter variable lies in a thin shell outside the domain, which generalizes Range's method.</description>

      <title>General Airy-type equations, heat-type equations and pseudo-processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of higher-order Airy-type differential equations providing the explicit form of the solutions, deriving their power series expansions and a probabilistic interpretation. Under suitable convergence hypotheses, we compute their integral on the real line and, by means of complex integration, we provide alternative explicit forms. We then focus on the differential equations governing their derivatives, their products, their convolutions and higher-order Scorer type equations. Then, we study higher-order heat-type fractional Cauchy, showing that their fundamental solutions can be expressed in terms of Airy-type functions and their convolutions, recovering as special cases several results of appeared in previous papers. Furthermore, pseudo-processes theory permits us to give nice interpretations of the results, extending them in the case of equations involving different fractional operators and study the moments of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic variational method for functionals depending on eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds. It is based on a new concept of Palais Smale sequences that can be constructed thanks to a generalization of classical min-max methods on $C^1$ functionals to locally-Lipschitz functionals. We prove convergence results on these Palais-Smale sequences emerging from combinations of Laplace eigenvalues or combinations of Steklov eigenvalues in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Method in PDE-based Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a shape optimization based method for finding the best interpolation data in the compression of images with noise. The aim is to reconstruct missing regions by means of minimizing a data fitting term in an $L^p$-norm between original images and their reconstructed counterparts using linear diffusion PDE-based inpainting. Reformulating the problem as a constrained optimization over sets (shapes), we derive the topological asymptotic expansion of the considered shape functionals with respect to the insertion of small ball (a single pixel) using the adjoint method. Based on the achieved distributed topological shape derivatives, we propose a numerical approach to determine the optimal set and present numerical experiments showing, the efficiency of our method. Numerical computations are presented that confirm the usefulness of our theoretical findings for PDE-based image compression.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion by fractal homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $\alpha &lt; \frac13$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $\mathbf{b}(t,x)$ which is periodic in space and time and belongs to $C^0_t C^{\alpha}_x \cap C^{\alpha}_t C^0_x$ such that the corresponding scalar advection-diffusion equation $$\partial_t \theta^\kappa + \mathbf{b} \cdot \nabla \theta^\kappa - \kappa \Delta \theta^\kappa = 0$$ exhibits anomalous dissipation of scalar variance for arbitrary $H^1$ initial data: $$\limsup_{\kappa \to 0} \int_0^{1} \int_{\mathbb{T}^d} \kappa \| \nabla \theta^\kappa (t,x) \|^2 \,dx\,dt &gt;0.$$ The vector field is deterministic and has a fractal structure, with periodic shear flows alternating in time between different directions serving as the base fractal. These shear flows are repeatedly inserted at infinitely many scales in suitable Lagrangian coordinates. Using an argument based on ideas from quantitative homogenization, the corresponding advection-diffusion equation with small $\kappa$ is progressively renormalized, one scale at a time, starting from the (very small) length scale determined by the molecular diffusivity up to the macroscopic (unit) scale. At each renormalization step, the effective diffusivity is enhanced by the influence of advection on that scale. By iterating this procedure across many scales, the effective diffusivity on the macroscopic scale is shown to be of order one.</description>

      <title>A new type of bubble solutions for a critical fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following critical fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^s u+V(|y'|,y'')u = u^{2_s^*-1},\quad u&gt;0,\quad y =(y',y'') \in \mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^{N-3}, \end{equation*} where $N\geq 3,s\in(0,1)$, $2_s^*=\frac{2N}{N-2s}$ is the fractional critical Sobolev exponent and $V(|y'|,y'')$ is a bounded non-negative function in $\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^{N-3}$. If $r^{2s}V(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point $(r_0,y_0'')$ with $r_0&gt;0$ and $V(r_0,y_0'')&gt;0$, by using a finite-dimensional reduction method and various local Pohozaev identities, we prove that the problem above has a new type of infinitely many solutions which concentrate at points lying on the top and the bottom of a cylinder. And the concentration points of the bubble solutions include saddle points of the function $r^{2s}V(r,y'')$. We have to overcome some difficulties caused by the non-localness of the fractional Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: We establish $L^2$-exponential decay properties for linear dissipative kinetic equations, including the time-relaxation and Fokker-Planck models, in bounded spatial domains with general boundary conditions that may not conserve mass. Their diffusion asymptotics in $L^2$ is also derived under general Maxwell boundary conditions. The proofs are simply based on energy estimates together with previous ideas from $L^2$-hypocoercivity and relative entropy methods.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a toy model for rate-independent droplet motion on a surface with contact angle hysteresis based on the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem. We consider a notion of energy solutions and show existence by a minimizing movement scheme. The main result of the paper is on the PDE conditions satisfied by general energy solutions: we show that the solutions satisfy the dynamic contact angle condition $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}$-a.e. along the contact line at every time.</description>

      <title>Nondegeneracy properties and uniqueness of positive solutions to a class of fractional semilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10577v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that positive solutions $u\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to the equation $(-\Delta )^s u+ u=u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ are nonradially nondegenerate, for all $s\in (0,1)$, $N\geq 1$ and $p&gt;1$ strictly smaller than the critical Sobolev exponent. By this we mean that the linearized equation $(-\Delta )^s w+ w-pu^{p-1}w = 0$ does not admit nonradial solutions beside the directional derivatives of $u$. Letting $B$ be the unit centered ball and $\lambda_1(B)$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta )^s$, we also prove that positive solutions to $(-\Delta )^s u+\lambda u=u^p$ in ${B}$ with $u=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus B$, are nonradially nondegenerate for any $\lambda&gt; -\lambda_1(B)$ in the sense that the linearized equation does not admit nonradial solutions. From these results, we then deduce uniqueness and full nondegeneracy of positive solutions in some special cases. In particular, in the case $N=1$, we prove that the equation $(-\Delta )^s u+ u=u^2$ in $\mathbb{R}$ or in $B$, with zero exterior data, admits a unique even solution which is fully nondegenerate in the optimal range $s \in (\frac{1}{6},1)$, thus extending the classical uniqueness result of Amick and Toland on the Benjamin-Ono equation. Moreover, in the case $N=1$, $\lambda=0$, we also prove the uniqueness and full nondegeneracy of positive solutions for the Dirichlet problem in $B$ with arbitrary subcritical exponent $p$. Finally, we determine the unique positive ground state solution of $(-\Delta )^{\frac{1}{2}} u+ u=u^{p}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 1$ with $p=1+\frac{2}{N+1}$ and compute the sharp constant in the associated Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality $$
  \|u\|_{L^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}^N)} \le C \|(-\Delta )^{\frac{1}{4}} u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)}^{\frac{N}{N+2}} \|u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)}^{\frac{2}{N+2}}.

      <title>Supersonic Gravitational Collapse for Non-Isentropic Gaseous Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of unstable blowup in a quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work Cho et al. [Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math. 33 (2016): 145-166] the authors conjecture that the quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) $i u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $ for $ x \in \mathbb{T}$ is globally well-posed for real initial data. We identify initial data whose numerical solution blows up in contradiction of this conjecture. The solution exhibits self-similar blowup and potentially nontrivial self-similar dynamics, however the proper scaling ansatz remains elusive.
  Furthermore, the set of real initial data which blows up under the NLS dynamics appears to occur on a codimension-1 manifold, and we conjecture that it is precisely the stable manifold of the zero equilibrium for the nonlinear heat equation $u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $. We apply the parameterization method to study the internal dynamics of this manifold, offering a heuristic argument in support of our conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Global existence of very weak solutions to a non-local diffusion-advection-reaction equation is established under no-flux boundary conditions in higher dimensions. The equation features degenerate myopic diffusion and nonlocal adhesion and is an extension of a mass-conserving model recently derived in arXiv:2308.05676. The admissible degeneracy of the diffusion tensor is characterised in terms of the upper box fractal dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of steady-state for $3$-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with insulating boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We use Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to get the global existence of solutions around the steady state. Compared with the deterministic case, due to the stochastic forces, the momentum does not have the temporal derivative, which causes troubles to the energy estimates. We establish the asymptotic stability about the spatial derivatives by the weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from the deterministic case. The existence of invariant measure generated by the solutions to the evolving semiconductor equations is shown from the a priori energy estimates. Furthermore, the invariant measure is exactly the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, in which the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state plays an essential role.</description>

We are interested in the propagation of the semiclassical measures associated to solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for the canonical subLaplacian $\Delta_{\mathbb E}$ and at different time-scales $\tau$. In particular, for $\tau=1$ we recover a quantum-classical correspondence where we observe the fundamental role of abnormal extremal lifts of the Engel group and are able to discuss the speed of the propagation of the singularities. Furthermore, in order to understand the dispersive nature of the subLaplacian, we are led to develop a second-microlocal analysis on particular cones in our phase space. This is done by relating the quasi-contact structure of the group ${\mathbb E}$ to its semiclassical analysis via harmonic analysis. As a consequence, we are able to prove obstruction to local smoothness-type estimates and Strichartz estimates for the Engel subLaplacian.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequality for singular or degenerate parabolic equations in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of linear parabolic equations in non-divergence form in which the leading coefficients are measurable and they can be singular or degenerate as a weight belonging to the $A_{1+\frac{1}{n}}$ class of Muckenhoupt weights. Krylov-Safonov Harnack inequality for solutions is proved under some smallness assumption on a weighted mean oscillation of the weight. To prove the result, we introduce a class of generic weighted parabolic cylinders and the smallness condition on the weighted mean oscillation of the weight through which several growth lemmas are established. Additionally, a perturbation method is used and the parabolic Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci type maximum principle is crucially applied to suitable barrier functions to control the solutions. As corollaries, H\"{o}lder regularity estimates of solutions with respect to a quasi-distance, and a Liouville type theorem are obtained in the paper.</description>

      <title>Non planar free boundary minimal disks into ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of embedded non planar free boundary minimal disks into rotationally symmetric ellipsoids of $\mathbb{R}^3$. The construction relies on the optimization of combinations of first and second Steklov eigenvalues renormalized by the length of the boundary, among metrics on the disk. We also prove that non planar free boundary harmonic maps from a disk into a ellipsoid of $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that the coordinate functions are first or second Steklov eigenfunctions with respect to the associated critical metric is a minimal immersion (without branched points) and that if the critical metric is even with respect to the coordinates of the disk, then the minimal immersion is an embedding.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for an obstacle problem with T-monotone operator and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large deviation principle (LDP) for obstacle problems governed by a T-monotone operator and small multiplicative stochastic reaction. Our approach relies on a combination of new sufficient condition to prove LDP by Matoussi, Sabbagh and Zhang [Appl. Math. Optim. 2021] and Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to manage the Lagrange-multiplier associated with the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Boundary determination and local rigidity of analytic metrics in the Lorentzian scattering rigidity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering rigidity problem in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation known on a lateral timelike boundary. We show that one can recover the jet of the metric up to a gauge transformation near a lightlike strictly convex point. Assuming that the metric is real analytic, we show that one can recover the metric up to a gauge transformation as well near such a point.</description>

      <title>Stretching of Polymers and turbulence: Fokker Planck equation, special stochastic scaling limit and stationary law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>
