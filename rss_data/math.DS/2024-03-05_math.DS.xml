      <title>Finitary estimates for the distribution of lattice orbits in homogeneous spaces I: Riemannian metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H &lt; G$ both be noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic groups and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a lattice. Building on the work of Gorodnik-Weiss, we refine their techniques and obtain effective results. More precisely, we prove effective convergence of the distribution of dense $\Gamma$-orbits in $G/H$ to some limiting density on $G/H$ assuming effective equidistribution of regions of maximal horospherical orbits under one-parameter diagonal flows inside a dense $H$-orbit in $\Gamma \backslash G$. The significance of the effectivized argument is due to the recent effective equidistribution results of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang for $\Delta(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$, and future generalizations in that direction.</description>

      <title>Singular dynamics for discrete weak K.A.M. solutions of exact twist maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an exact twist map $f$, we introduce an inherent Lipschitz dynamics $\Sigma_+$ given by the discrete forward Lax-Oleinik semigroup. We investigate several properties of $\Sigma_+$ and show that for any discrete weak K.A.M. solution $u$, the non-differentiable points of $u$ are globally propagated and forward invariant by $\Sigma_+$. In particular, such propagating dynamics possesses the same rotation number as the associated Aubry-Mather set with respect to $u$.
  A detailed exposition of the corresponding Arnaud's observation \cite{Arnaud_2011} is then provided via $\Sigma_+$. Furthermore, we construct and analyze the dynamics on the pseudo-graphs of discrete weak K.A.M. solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current paper we attempt to transfer the notion of the projectional entropy, originally defined for multidimensional subshifts, to the case of actions of amenable groups. The main theorem states that if a system is strongly irreducible the equality of the entropy and the projectional entropy implies that the system has a product-like structure.</description>

      <title>On the Arnold diffusion mechanism in Medium Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space debris mitigation guidelines represent the most effective method to preserve the circumterrestrial environment. Among them, end-of-life disposal solutions play a key role. A growing effort is devoted to exploit natural perturbations to lead the satellites towards an atmospheric reentry, reducing the disposal cost, also if departing from high-altitude regions. In the case of the Medium Earth Orbit region, home of the navigation satellites (like Galileo), the main driver is the gravitational perturbation due to the Moon, that can increase the eccentricity in the long term. In this way, the pericenter altitude can get into the atmospheric drag domain and the satellite can eventually reenter.
  In this work, we show how an Arnold diffusion mechanism can trigger the eccentricity growth. Focusing on the case of Galileo, we consider a hierarchy of Hamiltonian models, assuming that the main perturbations on the motion of the spacecraft are the oblateness of the Earth and the gravitational attraction of the Moon. First, the Moon is assumed to lay on the ecliptic plane and periodic orbits and associated stable and unstable invariant manifolds are computed for various energy levels, in the neighborhood of a given resonance. Along each invariant manifold, the eccentricity increases naturally, achieving its maximum at the first intersection between them. This growth is, however, not sufficient to achieve reentry. By moving to a model where the inclination of the Moon is taken into account, the problem becomes non-autonomous and the satellite is able to move along different energy levels. Under the ansatz of transversality of the manifolds in the autonomous case, checked numerically, Poincar\'e-Melnikov techniques are applied to show how diffusion can be attained, by constructing a sequence of homoclinic orbits that connect invariant tori at different energy levels.</description>

      <title>Analytic weak-stable manifolds in unfoldings of saddle-nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any attracting, hyperbolic and proper node of a two-dimensional analytic vector-field has a unique strong-stable manifold. This manifold is analytic. The corresponding weak-stable manifolds are, on the other hand, not unique, but in the nonresonant case there is a unique weak-stable manifold that is analytic. As the system approaches a saddle-node (under parameter variation), a sequence of resonances (of increasing order) occur. In this paper, we give a detailed description of the analytic weak-stable manifolds during this process. In particular, we relate a ``flapping-mechanism'', corresponding to a dramatic change of the position of the analytic weak-stable manifold as the parameter passes through the infinitely many resonances, to the lack of analyticity of the center manifold at the saddle-node. Our work is motivated and inspired by the work of Merle, Rapha\"{e}l, Rodnianski, and
  Szeftel, where this flapping mechanism is the crucial ingredient in the construction of $C^\infty$-smooth self-similar solutions of the compressible Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Smart abstraction based on iterative cover and non-uniform cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale approach for computing abstractions of dynamical systems, that incorporates both local and global optimal control to construct a goal-specific abstraction. For a local optimal control problem, we not only design the controller ensuring the transition between every two subsets (cells) of the state space but also incorporate the volume and shape of these cells into the optimization process. This integrated approach enables the design of non-uniform cells, effectively reducing the complexity of the abstraction. These local optimal controllers are then combined into a digraph, which is globally optimized to obtain the entire trajectory. The global optimizer attempts to lazily build the abstraction along the optimal trajectory, which is less affected by an increase in the number of dimensions. Since the optimal trajectory is generally unknown in practice, we propose a methodology based on the RRT* algorithm to determine it incrementally. We illustrate the approach on a planar nonlinear dynamical system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a Josephson junction consisting of two superconducting layers sandwiching an insulating layer is explored, which is subject to the effects of thermal fluctuations. The precise expressions for the evolution of Josephson phase and the supercurrent through the junction are derived. A clockwise hysteresis cycle in the current-voltage characteristic curve is demonstrated mathematically. Additionally, the bifurcation of a planar limit cycle is established. The numerous stochastic thermodynamic properties of the resistively shunted superconducting tunnel junction system are described, considering the influence of three specific parameters: the conductance, the current bias and the noise intensity. Moreover, the probability density is characterized using the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Non-Cooperative Linear-Quadratic Output-feedback Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the inverse problem for linear-quadratic differential non-cooperative games with output-feedback. Given players' stabilizing feedback laws, the goal is to find cost function parameters that lead to a game for which the observed game dynamics are at a Nash equilibrium. Using the given feedback laws, we introduce a model-based algorithm that generates cost function parameters solving the above inverse problem. We introduce a correction procedure that at each iteration of the algorithm guarantees the existence of the feedback laws, which addresses a key challenge of output-feedback control designs. As an intermediate stage of the algorithm, we have developed a procedure for the initial stabilization of the multiple-input system with output-feedback information structure. We prove convergence and stability of the algorithm, and show the way to generate new games with necessary properties without requiring to run the complete algorithm repeatedly. Then the algorithm is extended to a model-free version that uses data samples generated by unknown dynamics and has the same converging and stabilizing properties as the model-based version. Finally, we show how the inverse problem can be solved in a distributed manner and provide possible extensions. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation and uncertainty quantification of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations in tandem, leveraging differentiable programming. Achieved through online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, this approach is enabled by the capabilities of differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Sharp systolic inequalities for invariant tight contact forms on principal S1-bundles over S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systole $\text{sys}(\alpha)$ of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove that the inequality $\text{sys}(\alpha)^2 \leq \text{vol}(M, \alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}\alpha)$ holds true for any tight contact form $\alpha$ invariant under the corresponding circle action. Moreover, equality holds exactly for Zoll contact forms, namely, contact forms whose Reeb orbits are all closed and have the same minimal period. This implies a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Assisted Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bellman equation and its continuous form, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, are ubiquitous in reinforcement learning (RL) and control theory. However, these equations quickly become intractable for systems with high-dimensional states and nonlinearity. This paper explores the connection between the data-driven Koopman operator and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), resulting in the development of two new RL algorithms to address these limitations. We leverage Koopman operator techniques to lift a nonlinear system into new coordinates where the dynamics become approximately linear, and where HJB-based methods are more tractable. In particular, the Koopman operator is able to capture the expectation of the time evolution of the value function of a given system via linear dynamics in the lifted coordinates. By parameterizing the Koopman operator with the control actions, we construct a ``Koopman tensor'' that facilitates the estimation of the optimal value function. Then, a transformation of Bellman's framework in terms of the Koopman tensor enables us to reformulate two max-entropy RL algorithms: soft value iteration and soft actor-critic (SAC). This highly flexible framework can be used for deterministic or stochastic systems as well as for discrete or continuous-time dynamics. Finally, we show that these Koopman Assisted Reinforcement Learning (KARL) algorithms attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with respect to traditional neural network-based SAC and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) baselines on four controlled dynamical systems: a linear state-space system, the Lorenz system, fluid flow past a cylinder, and a double-well potential with non-isotropic stochastic forcing.</description>

We assume the approximate controllability of the linear part, then we use the resolvent operators theory to prove the approximate controllability of the nonlinear case. An example of one-dimensional heat equation with memory is given to illustrate our basic results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, as well as the asymptotic behavior through a finite fractal dimensional global attractor for a general Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation, are investigated. Our findings are innovative, as we employ semigroups and global attractors theories to achieve these results. Also, an analytical solution of a two-dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation is presented. And finally, two Explicit Finite Difference schemes are used to simulate solutions in the two- and three-dimensional cases. The numerical simulations are conducted with predefined initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study weighted transfer operators associated to a piecewise expanding map on a compact manifold, and a piecewise Holder weight, acting on Sobolev spaces. We bound the essential spectral radius in terms of a topological pressure for a subadditive potential. Under a new small boundary pressure condition, we improve the estimate by establishing a variational principle for piecewise expanding maps and subadditive potentials.

      <description>arXiv:2306.01628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shortest distance between the first $n$ iterates of a typical point can be quantified with a log rule for some dynamical systems admitting Gibbs measures. We show this in two settings. For topologically mixing Markov shifts with at most countably infinite alphabet admitting a Gibbs measure with respect to a locally H\"{o}lder potential, we prove the asymptotic length of the longest common substring for a typical point converges and the limit depends on the R\'{e}nyi entropy. For interval maps with the Gibbs-Markov structure, we prove a similar rule relating the correlation dimension of Gibbs measures with the shortest distance between two iterates in the orbit generated by a typical point.</description>

Neuronal microtubules must be stable enough to ensure reliable transport, but they also undergo dynamic instability, as their plus and minus ends continuously switch between growth and shrinking. This process allows for continuous rebuilding of the cytoskeleton and for flexibility in injury settings. Motivated by \textit{in vivo} experimental data on microtubule behavior in \textit{Drosophila} neurons, we propose a mathematical model of dendritic microtubule dynamics, with a focus on understanding microtubule length, velocity, and state-duration distributions. We find that limitations on microtubule growth phases are needed for realistic dynamics, but the type of limiting mechanism leads to qualitatively different responses to plausible experimental perturbations. We therefore propose and investigate two minimally-complex length-limiting factors: limitation due to resource (tubulin) constraints and limitation due to catastrophe of large-length microtubules. We combine simulations of a detailed stochastic model with steady-state analysis of a mean-field ordinary differential equations model to map out qualitatively distinct parameter regimes. This provides a basis for predicting changes in microtubule dynamics, tubulin allocation, and the turnover rate of tubulin within microtubules in different experimental environments.</description>

      <title>Geodesic tracking and the shape of ergodic rotation sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for ergodic homological rotation sets of homeomorphisms isotopic to the identity on a closed orientable hyperbolic surface: this set is made of a finite number of pieces that are either one-dimensional or almost convex. The latter ones give birth to horseshoes; in the case of a zero-entropy homeomorphism we show that there exists a geodesic lamination containing the directions in which generic orbits with respect to ergodic invariant probabilities turn around the surface under iterations of the homeomorphism. The proof is based on the idea of $\textit{geodesic tracking}$ of orbits that are typical for some invariant measure by geodesics on the surface, that allows to get links between the dynamics of such points and the one of the geodesic flow on some invariant subset of the unit tangent bundle of the surface.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of quasi-periodic discrete schr\"odinger operators with cantor spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that, for fixed Diophantine frequencies and generic small smooth or analytic quasi-periodic potentials, both continuous and discrete Schr\"odinger operators have Cantor spectrum. In this article, we construct discrete 1-dim Schr\"odinger operators with a class of Geverey potentials such that Cantor spectrum occurs. This is based on a reducibility theorem given by KAM theory for quasi-periodic SL(2, R) cocycles, and also based on the Moser-P\"oschel argument for the quasi-periodic Schrdinger cocycles. Additionally, we provide polynomial asymptotic on the size of spectral gaps.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, for a given family of constraints and the classical Cantor distribution we determine the constrained optimal sets of $n$-points, $n$th constrained quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. We also calculate the constrained quantization dimension and the constrained quantization coefficient, and see that the constrained quantization dimension $D(P)$ exists as a finite positive number, but the $D(P)$-dimensional constrained quantization coefficient does not exist.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Borel version of the local lemma, i.e. we show that, under suitable assumptions, if the set of variables in the local lemma has a structure of a Borel space, then there exists a satisfying assignment which is a Borel function. The main tool which we develop for the proof, which is of independent interest, is a parallel version of the Moser-Tardos algorithm which uses the same random bits to resample clauses that are far enough in the dependency graph.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis systems with singular sensitivity and logistic source: Boundedness, persistence, absorbing set, and entire solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v} \nabla v)+u(a(t,x)-b(t,x) u), &amp; x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \mu v+ \nu u, &amp; x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=0, &amp; x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are positive smooth functions, and $\chi$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. In the very recent paper [25], we proved that for given nonnegative initial function $0\not\equiv u_0\in C^0(\bar \Omega)$ and $s\in\mathbb{R}$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;s,u_0),v(t,x;s,u_0))$ with $u(s,x;s,u_0)=u_0(x)$, provided that $a_{\inf}=\inf_{t\in\mathbb{R},x\in\Omega}a(t,x)$ is large relative to $\chi$ and $u_0$ is not small. In this paper, we further investigate qualitative properties of globally defined positive solutions of (0.1) under the assumption that $a_{\inf}$ is large relative to $\chi$ and $u_0$ is not small. Among others, we provide some concrete estimates for $\int_\Omega u^{-p}$ and $\int_\Omega u^q$ for some $p&gt;0$ and $q&gt;\max\{2,N\}$ and prove that any globally defined positive solution is bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants independent of its initial functions. We prove the existence of a ``rectangular'' type bounded invariant set (in $L^q$) which eventually attracts all the globally defined positive solutions. We also prove that (0.1) has a positive entire classical solution $(u^*(t,x),v^*(t,x))$, which is periodic in $t$ if $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are periodic in $t$ and is independent of $t$ if $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are independent of $t$.</description>

      <title>Approximations on Spirallike domains of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that any domain $\Om$ in $\cn(n \geq 2)$, which is spirallike with respect to a complete holomorphic globally asymptotic stable vector field $F$, is a Runge domain. Next, we prove an Anders\'{e}n-Lempert type approximation theorem: any biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Om \to \Phi(\Om)$, with $\Phi(\Om)$ is Runge, can be approximated by automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ uniformly on compacts, in the following two cases.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item [(i)] The domain $\Om\subset\cn$ is a spirallike with respect to a linear vector field $A$, where $2\max\{\rl\lambda:\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}&lt;\min\{\rl\lambda:\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}$.
  \item [(ii)] The domain $\Om$ is spirallike with respect to complete globally exponentially stable vector field $F$, with a certain rate of the convergence of the flow of the vector field $F$ in $\Om $
  \end{itemize}
  We further show that, if $J(\Phi) \equiv 1$ (and $div(F)$ is constant in the situation (ii)) then the biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Om \to \Phi(\Om)$ can be approximated by volume preserving automorphism of $\cn$ in both the cases mentioned above. As an application of our approximation results, we show that any Loewner PDE in a complete hyperbolic domain $\Om$ which satisfies (i) or (ii) mentioned above admits an essentially unique univalent solution with values in $\cn$. We also provide an example of a Hartogs domain in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ which spirallike with respect to a complete holomorphic vector field $F(z_{1},z_{2})=(-2z_{1},-3z_{2}+z_{1}z_{2})$, but the domain is not spirallike with respect to any linear vector field. Some more examples are provided at the end of this paper.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diophantine Exponents for $\mathrm{SL}(n)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Diophantine exponent} of an action of a group on a homogeneous space, as defined by Ghosh, Gorodnik, and Nevo, quantifies the complexity of approximating the points of the homogeneous space by the points on an orbit of the group. We show that the Diophantine exponent of the $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/p])$-action on the generalized upper half-space $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}_n(\mathbb{R})$, lies in $[1,1+O(1/n)]$, substantially improving upon Ghosh--Gorodnik--Nevo's method which gives the above range to be $[1,n-1]$. We also show that the exponent is \emph{optimal}, i.e.\ equals one, under the assumption of \emph{Sarnak's density hypothesis}. The result, in particular, shows that the optimality of Diophantine exponents can be obtained even when the \emph{temperedness} of the underlying representations, the crucial assumption in Ghosh--Gorodnik--Nevo's work, is not satisfied. The proof uses the spectral decomposition of the homogeneous space and bounds on the local $L^2$-norms of the Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Curse of Dimensionality with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12306v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curse-of-dimensionality taxes computational resources heavily with exponentially increasing computational cost as the dimension increases. This poses great challenges in solving high-dimensional PDEs, as Richard E. Bellman first pointed out over 60 years ago. While there has been some recent success in solving numerically partial differential equations (PDEs) in high dimensions, such computations are prohibitively expensive, and true scaling of general nonlinear PDEs to high dimensions has never been achieved. We develop a new method of scaling up physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve arbitrary high-dimensional PDEs. The new method, called Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD), decomposes a gradient of PDEs into pieces corresponding to different dimensions and randomly samples a subset of these dimensional pieces in each iteration of training PINNs. We prove theoretically the convergence and other desired properties of the proposed method. We demonstrate in various diverse tests that the proposed method can solve many notoriously hard high-dimensional PDEs, including the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and the Schr\"{o}dinger equations in tens of thousands of dimensions very fast on a single GPU using the PINNs mesh-free approach. Notably, we solve nonlinear PDEs with nontrivial, anisotropic, and inseparable solutions in 100,000 effective dimensions in 12 hours on a single GPU using SDGD with PINNs. Since SDGD is a general training methodology of PINNs, it can be applied to any current and future variants of PINNs to scale them up for arbitrary high-dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>Parameter identifiability in PDE models of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying unique parameters for mathematical models describing biological data can be challenging and often impossible. Parameter identifiability for partial differential equations models in cell biology is especially difficult given that many established \textit{in vivo} measurements of protein dynamics average out the spatial dimensions. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments on the binding dynamics of the RNA-binding protein PTBP3 in RNP granules of frog oocytes based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. FRAP is a widely-used experimental technique for probing protein dynamics in living cells, and is often modeled using simple reaction-diffusion models of the protein dynamics. We show that current methods of structural and practical parameter identifiability provide limited insights into identifiability of kinetic parameters for these PDE models and spatially-averaged FRAP data. We thus propose a pipeline for assessing parameter identifiability and for learning parameter combinations based on re-parametrization and profile likelihoods analysis. We show that this method is able to recover parameter combinations for synthetic FRAP datasets and investigate its application to real experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $ $This paper addresses the inverse problem for Linear-Quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum $N$-player differential games, where the goal is to learn parameters of an unknown cost function for the game, called observed, given the demonstrated trajectories that are known to be generated by stationary linear feedback Nash equilibrium laws. Towards this end, using the demonstrated data, a synthesized game needs to be constructed, which is required to be equivalent to the observed game in the sense that the trajectories generated by the equilibrium feedback laws of the $N$ players in the synthesized game are the same as those demonstrated trajectories. We show a model-based algorithm that can accomplish this task using the given trajectories. We then extend this model-based algorithm to a model-free setting to solve the same problem in the case when the system's matrices are unknown. The algorithms combine both inverse optimal control and reinforcement learning methods making extensive use of gradient descent optimization for the latter. The analysis of the algorithm focuses on the proof of its convergence and stability. To further illustrate possible solution characterization, we show how to generate an infinite number of equivalent games, not requiring to run repeatedly the complete algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an example of a parabolic holomorphic self-map $f$ of the unit ball $\mathbb B^2\subset \mathbb C^2$ whose canonical Kobayashi hyperbolic semi-model is given by an elliptic automorphism of the disc $\mathbb D\subset \mathbb C$, which can be chosen to be different from the identity. As a consequence, in contrast to the one dimensional case, this provides a first example of a holomorphic self-map of the unit ball which has points with zero hyperbolic step and points with nonzero hyperbolic step, solving an open question and showing that parabolic dynamics in the ball $\\mathbb B^2$ is radically different from parabolic dynamics in the disc. The example is obtained via a geometric method, embedding the ball $\mathbb B^2$ as a domain $\Omega$ in the bidisc $\\mathbb D\times \mathbb{H}$ that is forward invariant and absorbing for the map $(z,w)\mapsto (e^{i\theta}z,w+1)$, where $\mathbb H\subset \mathbb C$ denotes the right half-plane. We also show that a complete Kobayashi hyperbolic domain $\Omega$ with such properties cannot be Gromov hyperbolic w.r.t. the Kobayashi distance (hence, it cannot be biholomorphic to $\\mathbb B^2$) if an additional quantitative geometric condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Invariance Proximity: Closed-Form Error Bounds for Finite-Dimensional Koopman-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular way to approximate the Koopman operator's action on a finite-dimensional subspace of functions is via orthogonal projections. The quality of the projected model directly depends on the selected subspace, specifically on how close it is to being invariant under the Koopman operator. The notion of invariance proximity provides a tight upper bound on the worst-case relative prediction error of the finite-dimensional model. However, its direct calculation is computationally challenging. This paper leverages the geometric structure behind the definition of invariance proximity to provide a closed-form expression in terms of Jordan principal angles on general inner product spaces. Unveiling this connection allows us to exploit specific isomorphisms to circumvent the computational challenges associated with spaces of functions and enables the use of existing efficient numerical routines to compute invariance proximity.</description>

      <title>Hutchinson Trace Estimation for High-Dimensional and High-Order Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have proven effective in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially when some data are available by seamlessly blending data and physics. However, extending PINNs to high-dimensional and even high-order PDEs encounters significant challenges due to the computational cost associated with automatic differentiation in the residual loss. Herein, we address the limitations of PINNs in handling high-dimensional and high-order PDEs by introducing Hutchinson Trace Estimation (HTE). Starting with the second-order high-dimensional PDEs ubiquitous in scientific computing, HTE transforms the calculation of the entire Hessian matrix into a Hessian vector product (HVP). This approach alleviates the computational bottleneck via Taylor-mode automatic differentiation and significantly reduces memory consumption from the Hessian matrix to HVP. We further showcase HTE's convergence to the original PINN loss and its unbiased behavior under specific conditions. Comparisons with Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD) highlight the distinct advantages of HTE, particularly in scenarios with significant variance among dimensions. We further extend HTE to higher-order and higher-dimensional PDEs, specifically addressing the biharmonic equation. By employing tensor-vector products (TVP), HTE efficiently computes the colossal tensor associated with the fourth-order high-dimensional biharmonic equation, saving memory and enabling rapid computation. The effectiveness of HTE is illustrated through experimental setups, demonstrating comparable convergence rates with SDGD under memory and speed constraints. Additionally, HTE proves valuable in accelerating the Gradient-Enhanced PINN (gPINN) version as well as the Biharmonic equation. Overall, HTE opens up a new capability in scientific machine learning for tackling high-order and high-dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Games in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper represents the first attempt to develop a theory for linear-quadratic mean field games in possibly infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a starting point, we study the case, considered in most finite dimensional contributions on the topic, where the dependence on the distribution enters just in the objective functional through the mean. This feature allows, similarly to the finite dimensional case, to reduce the usual mean field game system to a Riccati equation and a forward-backward coupled system of abstract evolution equations. Such system is completely new in infinite dimension and no results have been proved on it so far. We show existence and uniqueness of solutions for such system, applying a delicate approximation procedure. We apply the results to a production output planning problem with delay in the control variable.</description>

      <title>Rigorously proven chaos in chemical kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a longstanding question regarding the mathematical proof of chaotic behavior in kinetic differential equations. Following the numerous numerical and experimental results in the past 50 years, we introduce two formal chemical reactions that rigorously demonstrate this behavior. Our approach involves transforming chaotic equations into kinetic differential equations and subsequently realizing these equations through formal chemical reactions. The findings present a novel perspective on chaotic dynamics within chemical kinetics, thereby resolving a longstanding open problem.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data. Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</description>
