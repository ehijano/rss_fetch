      <title>UQ of 2D Slab Burner DNS: Surrogates, Uncertainty Propagation, and Parameter Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate and address challenges related to all aspects of performing a complete uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis of a complicated physics-based simulation like a 2D slab burner direct numerical simulation (DNS). The UQ framework includes the development of data-driven surrogate models, propagation of parametric uncertainties to the fuel regression rate--the primary quantity of interest--and Bayesian calibration of critical parameters influencing the regression rate using experimental data. Specifically, the parameters calibrated include the latent heat of sublimation and a chemical reaction temperature exponent. Two surrogate models, a Gaussian Process (GP) and a Hierarchical Multiscale Surrogate (HMS) were constructed using an ensemble of 64 simulations generated via Latin Hypercube sampling. Both models exhibited comparable performance during cross-validation. However, the HMS was more stable due to its ability to handle multiscale effects, in contrast with the GP which was very sensitive to kernel choice. Analysis revealed that the surrogates do not accurately predict all spatial locations of the slab burner as-is. Subsequent Bayesian calibration of the physical parameters against experimental observations resulted in regression rate predictions that closer align with experimental observation in specific regions. This study highlights the importance of surrogate model selection and parameter calibration in quantifying uncertainty in predictions of fuel regression rates in complex combustion systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy mediated liquid-to-solid nucleation and transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for studying matter at the atomic scale. However, to simulate solids, an initial atomic structure is crucial for the successful execution of MD simulations, but can be difficult to prepare due to insufficient atomistic information. At the same time Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) measurements can determine the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) of atomic structures. However, the interpretation of RDFs is often challenging. Here we present an algorithm that can bias MD simulations with RDFs by combining the information of the MD atomic interaction potential and the RDF under the principle of maximum relative entropy. We show that this algorithm can be used to adjust the RDF of one liquid model, e.g., the TIP3P water model, to reproduce the RDF and improve the Angular Distribution Function (ADF) of another model, such as the TIP4P/2005 water model. In addition, we demonstrate that the algorithm can initiate crystallization in liquid systems, leading to both stable and metastable crystalline states defined by the RDF, e.g., crystallization of water to ice and liquid TiO2 to rutile or anatase. Finally, we discuss how this method can be useful for improving interaction models, studying crystallization processes, interpreting measured RDFs, or training machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>X-MeshGraphNet: Scalable Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges.
  X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from CAD files by generating uniform point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions.
  Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus: github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/examples/cfd/xaeronet.</description>

      <title>A Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of topology by electric field in breathing kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome lattices have attracted much attention recently due to the interplay of band topology with magnetism and electronic correlations, which give rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. A common structural distortion of the kagome lattice is the breathing mode, which can significantly influence the magnetism and band characteristics. However, the modulation of breathing mode and the associated topological phenomena remain rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate that the coupling of breathing modes with ferroelectricity, magnetism, and band topology in the M3X8 monolayer system enables electric field manipulation of topological spin structure and electronic states. The breathing mode mainly occurs in materials containing early 4d/5d transition metal elements and can be reversed or even suppressed via ferroelectric switching in low-barrier materials. Importantly, electric field-induced switching of the breathing mode can alter the chirality of the topological spin structure, or trigger a transition from a topological trivial insulator to a Chern insulator. This work paves the way for exploring novel physical phenomena driven by breathing modes in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <title>A weighted scalar auxiliary variable method for solving gradient flows: bridging the nonlinear energy-based and Lagrange multiplier approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two primary scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches are widely applied for simulating gradient flow systems, i.e., the nonlinear energy-based approach and the Lagrange multiplier approach. The former guarantees unconditional energy stability through a modified energy formulation, whereas the latter preserves original energy stability but requires small time steps for numerical solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted SAV method which integrates these two approaches for the first time. Our method leverages the advantages of both approaches: (i) it ensures the existence of numerical solutions for any time step size with a sufficiently large weight coefficient; (ii) by using a weight coefficient smaller than one, it achieves a discrete energy closer to the original, potentially ensuring stability under mild conditions; and (iii) it maintains consistency in computational cost by utilizing the same time/spatial discretization formulas. We present several theorems and numerical experiments to validate the accuracy, energy stability and superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Improved Quantum Algorithm of the Multislice Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multisilce method is an important algorithm for electron diffraction and image simulations in transmission electron microscopy. We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The new quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical supercomputer and analyzed the result to prove the feasibility and correctness of the improved quantum algorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the formation of droplets in the dimer model on a triangular lattice. The droplets in the dimer model are superposition polygons formed as two overlapping configurations of dimers: constant and movable. We demonstrate that specific local energies of dimers and low temperatures lead to the emergence of a macroscopic droplet. The motivation for this study was the phenomenon of the formation of equilibrium droplets under certain conditions in the Ising model within the framework of the Dobrushin-Koteck\'y-Shlosman theory. Due to the deep connections between the Ising model and the dimer model, similar behaviour was expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern E(3)-Equivariant networks may be used to predict rotationally equivariant properties, including tensorial quantities. Three such quantities: the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors, are computationally expensive to produce ab initio for crystalline systems; however, with greater availability of such data in large material property databases, we now have a sufficient target space to begin training equivariant models in the prediction of such properties. Here we explicitly develop spherical harmonic decompositions of these tensorial properties using their general symmetries. We then apply three distinct E(3)-equivariant convolutional structures to the prediction of the components of these decompositions, allowing us to predict the aforementioned tensorial quantities in an equivariant manner and compare performance. We further report results testing the transferability of these predictive models between different tensorial target sets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent horizon finding problem with multigrid methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>
