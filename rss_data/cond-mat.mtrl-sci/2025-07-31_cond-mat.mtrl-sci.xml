      <title>Quantitative Nonlinear Optical Polarimetry with High Spatial Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical microscopy such as in the optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) modality has become a popular tool today for probing materials in the physical and biological sciences. While imaging and spectroscopy are widely used in the microscopy mode, nonlinear polarimetry, which can shed light on materials' symmetry and microstructure, is relatively underdeveloped. This is partly because quantitative analytical modeling of the optical SHG response for anisotropic crystals and films largely assumes low-numerical aperture (NA) focusing of light, where the plane-wave approximation is sufficient. Tight focusing provides unique benefits in revealing out-of-plane polarization responses, which cannot be detected by near-plane-wave illumination at normal incidence. Here, we outline a method for quantitatively analyzing SHG polarimetry measurements obtained under high-NA focusing within a microscope geometry. Experiments and simulations of a variety of standard samples, from single crystals to thin films, are in good agreement, including measured and simulated spatial SHG maps of ferroelectric domains. A solution to the inverse problem is demonstrated, where the spatial distribution of an SHG tensor with unknown tensor coefficient magnitudes is determined by experimentally measured polarimetry. The ability to extract the out-of-plane component of the nonlinear polarization in normal incidence is demonstrated, which can be valuable for high-resolution polarimetry of 2D materials, thin films, heterostructures, and uniaxial crystals with a strong out-of-plane response.

      <title>Realizing Nonreciprocal Linear Dichroism and Emission from Simple Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity, the principle that a system response is identical in the forward path compared to the backward path, is a fundamental concept across physics, from electrical circuits and optics to acoustics and heat conduction. Nonreciprocity arises when this symmetry is broken, enabling directional-dependent behavior. In photonics, nonreciprocity allows control over the propagation of electromagnetic waves, essential for isolators and circulators. But achieving optical nonreciprocity typically requires complex metamaterials, exotic media, or strong external fields. Because of this, researchers have historically overlooked the possibility that readily available materials could support nonreciprocal optical behavior, assuming that conventional systems lack the ability to produce nonreciprocal behavior. In this work, we challenge that assumption by revisiting the light-matter interactions of chiroptic and linearly anisotropic media. Through Stokes-Mueller formalism we derive a simple analytical expression that predicts a pathway to nonreciprocal absorption and emission of orthogonal linear polarizations. We test this idea experimentally using solution-processed films of CdS, CdSe, and CdTe magic-size clusters that possess commensurate circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD)values and find that they can support this effect, engineering films that exhibit nonreciprocal absorption and emission of linearly polarized light. Based on the derived expressions and experiments, several design rules are presented. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal linear dichroism and emission can be achieved in readily processable, macroscopically symmetric materials by harnessing chiral-linear optical interference. This work opens new opportunities for scalable, polarization-based photonic control for direction-dependent optical routing, optical logic, and polarization-multiplexed information encoding.</description>

      <title>Local Inversion Symmetry Breaking and Thermodynamic Evidence for Ferrimagnetism in Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered compound Fe3GaTe2 is attracting attention due to its high Curie temperature, low dimensionality, and the presence of topological spin textures above room temperature, making Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ a good candidate for applications in spintronics. Here, we show, through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals break local inversion symmetry while maintaining global inversion symmetry according to X-ray diffraction. Coupled to the observation of N\'{e}el skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM, our structural analysis provides a convincing explanation for their presence in centrosymmetric materials. Magnetization measurements as a function of the temperature displays a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase-transition leading to a reduction in the magnetic moment. This implies that the ground state of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ is globally ferrimagnetic and not a glassy magnetic state composed of ferrimagnetic, and ferromagnetic domains as previously claimed. Neutron diffraction studies indicate that the ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition upon reducing the external magnetic field is associated with a change in the magnetic configuration/coupling between Fe1 and Fe2 moments. We observe a clear correlation between the hysteresis observed in both the skyrmion density and the magnetization of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. This indicates that its topological spin textures are affected by the development of ferrimagnetism upon cooling. Observation, via magnetic force microscopy, of magnetic bubbles at the magnetic phase boundary suggests skyrmions stabilized by the competition among magnetic phases and distinct exchange interactions. Our study provides an explanation for the observation of N\'eel skyrmions in centrosymmetric systems, while exposing a correlation between the distinct magnetic phases of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Effect of RKKY and dipolar interaction on the nucleation of skyrmion in Pt/Co multilayer with Ir spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically protected spin textures, have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. In this study, we investigate the stabilization of skyrmionic states in a uniquely engineered Pt/Co multilayer system with an Ir spacer, where both Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar interactions play a crucial role. The studied multilayer structure consists of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) configuration, where a single Ir layer facilitates strong antiferromagnetic coupling between two ferromagnetic regions: FM1 (top) and FM2 (bottom), each formed by repeated Co layers separated by Pt, enabling significant dipolar interactions. This FM1/Ir/FM2 configuration results in a distinctive skyrmionic hysteresis loop, driven by the interplay of dipolar and RKKY interactions. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging confirms the nucleation of isolated skyrmions, while magnetotransport measurements reveal a finite topological Hall effect (THE), indicating the chiral nature of these spin textures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increasing the Co layer thickness leads to a reduction in magnetic anisotropy, which in turn results in the formation of relatively larger and denser skyrmions. Our findings establish a robust approach for stabilizing skyrmions through the combined effects of dipolar and RKKY interactions, offering new pathways for controlled skyrmion manipulation in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Extended Factorization Machine Annealing for Rapid Discovery of Transparent Conducting Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii) the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning via a bit-string local search. Validation using the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the further advancement of materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Giant odd-parity magnetoresistance from proximity-induced topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance typically exhibits even symmetry with respect to the magnetic field, owing to time reversal symmetry (TRS) as dictated by Onsager reciprocity relations. However, in certain systems where TRS is broken, magnetoresistance may acquire an odd component with respect to the magnetic field, referred to as odd parity magnetoresistance (OMR). To date, reported OMR values have been modest, usually restricted to a few tens of percent even under high magnetic fields. Here, we report the discovery of a giant OMR reaching up to 1,150% under a relatively low field of 1 T in a heterostructure composed of 3 nm thick alpha Sn and a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (In,Fe)Sb. Although alpha Sn in this thickness range is a trivial narrow gap semiconductor, analysis of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations combined with ab initio calculations reveals the emergence of tilted topological surface states, induced via magnetic proximity from the (In,Fe)Sb layer. The observed OMR behavior is well explained by a Boltzmann transport model assuming the presence of oppositely tilted Weyl cones in the alpha Sn band structure. Our findings not only shed new light on the physics of OMR but also suggest promising avenues for its application in electronic and spintronic devices, such as ultrasensitive magnetic sensors.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Topological Properties of the Antiferromagnetic V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ via Sb concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of topological materials has uncovered groundbreaking phases of matter with significant implications for quantum technologies. Here, we explore the antiferromagnetic topological insulator family V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ ($x$=$0$, $0.5$, $1$), formed by introducing vanadium telluride (VTe) layers into the layered topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Our results reveal the tunability of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and its topological contribution, quantified by the recently introduced average Spin Chern Number (ASCN), via Sb concentration. The materials' strong topological insulating behavior is established through spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversions, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants, and the presence of topological surface states. These findings position V(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices and advanced quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in 6H perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of a centrosymmetric crystallographic structure with local structural alternations and collinear antiferromagnetism can lead to broken PT (Parity $\times$ Time-reversal) symmetry, resulting in altermagnets with non-relativistic spin-split bands. The 6H perovskites with composition A$_3$BB'$_2$O$_9$ exhibit unique layered structural alternations and typically adopt an antiferromagnetic ground state. Here, we report the discovery that several 6H perovskites are indeed altermagnets exhibiting non-relativistic spin-split bands. We also explore the possible presence of net magnetization due to spin-orbit coupling in these materials, as well as the manifestation of giant piezomagnetism. Since the single crystals of 6H perovskites can be readily grown and cleavable, our findings provide a new avenue to study the cleaved atomically-flat surfaces of altermagnets with advanced experimental techniques such as spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore their spin splitting nature.</description>

      <title>Disorder driven crossover between anomalous Hall regimes in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of the Fe$_3$(Ge,Ga)Te$_2$ compounds has attracted considerable attention. Here, we expose the intrinsic nature of AHC in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ crystals characterized by high conductivities, which show disorder-independent AHC with a pronounced value $\sigma_{xy}^{\text{c}}\approx$ 420 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. In the low conductivity regime, we observe the scaling relation $\sigma_{xy}\propto\sigma_{xx}^{1.6}$, which crosses over to $\sigma_{xy} \simeq \sigma_{xy}^{\text{c}}$ as $\sigma_{xx}$ increases. Disorder in low-conductivity crystals is confirmed by the broadening of a first-order transition between ferromagnetism and the ferrimagnetic ground state. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that the dominant sources of Berry curvature are located a few hundred meV below the Fermi energy around the $\Gamma$-point. Therefore, Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ clearly exposes the disorder-induced crossover among distinct AHC regimes, previously inferred from measurements on different ferromagnets located in either side of the crossover region.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity identification by measuring magnetic quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the identification of sample inhomogeneity via magnetic quantum oscillations analysis in semimetal NbSb$_2$. By doping Bi and Cr, we obtained a homogeneous Bi-doped sample and an inhomogeneous Cr-doped sample, whose homogeneity was confirmed by comparing the magnetic quantum oscillation before and after grinding the samples. The magnetic quantum oscillations in the inhomogeneous sample exhibited a distinct phase shift and unusual field-dependent amplitude, believed to result from a non-uniform Fermi energy. The analysis of the magnetic quantum oscillations demonstrated that the homogeneous Bi-doped sample can be interpreted by the symmetric and Lorentzian effective Fermi energy distribution, while the inhomogeneous Cr-doped sample exhibited an asymmetric distribution, illustrating an unconventional violation of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. This research provides a novel method for identifying material inhomogeneity and mitigating potential misinterpretations of magnetic quantum oscillations' unusual phase, commonly seen as a nontrivial Berry phase indicator in topological materials studies.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of Rh- and Pd-based kagome-layered shandites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shandite structure hosts transition metals arranged in kagome layers stacked rhombohedrally, and interspersed with post-transition metal ions and chalcogens. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by the transition metal $d$-orbitals and feature saddle points near several of the high-symmetry positions of the Brillouin zone, most notably the F and L points. Combining symmetry considerations with ab initio methods, we study the electronic and structural properties of these materials with an emphasis on the connection between electronic saddle points at specific momenta and structural instabilities at these momenta. While the parent compounds studied are all found to be structurally stable in the $R\bar{3}m$ space group under ambient conditions we show that, in specific compounds, moving the saddle point closer to the Fermi level using either hydrostatic pressure or doping, can induce a structural instability. The importance of the electronic degrees of freedom in driving this instability is supported by the dependence of the frequency of the soft phonon mode on the electronic smearing temperature, as is the case in charge density wave materials. Our first-principles calculations show that as the smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable again. Our findings survey the structural properties of a large family of shandite materials and shed light on the role played by saddle points in the electronic structure in driving structural instabilities in rhombohedrally stacked kagome-layered materials belonging to the $R\bar{3}m$ space group.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Development of Amorphous/nanocrystalline Biphase Soft Magnetic Alloys with Silicon-steel like Saturated Magnetic Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximization saturation magnetic induction (Bs) of soft magnetic alloys is essential for the high power-density electromagnetic devices. However, identifying the alloy compositions with high Bs often replies on the lab-intensive melt casting method and a high-throughput characterization on magnetic properties remains challenging. Here, we develop a new combinatorial method for fast screening alloys with optimal soft magnetic properties based on the high-throughput MOKE screening method. Based on the combinatorial method, we found that the alloys with a combination of high Bs and low coercivity (Hc) tend to have a feature of amorphous-nanocrystalline biphase microstructure. We also identified an amorphous/nanocrystalline alloy film with the composition the Fe68.09Co17.02B10.9Si4, exhibiting an ultra-high Bs up to 2.02 T that surpasses all amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys reported so far and is comparable to that of silicon steels, together with a high resistivity of 882 {\mu}{\Omega} {\dot} cm, about 17 times of silicon steels. Our high-throughput magnetic screening method provides a paradigm for understanding the relationship between microstructure and magnetic properties and the development of the next-generation soft magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz spin-orbit torque as a drive of spin dynamics in insulating antiferromagnet Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to conventional wisdom that spin dynamics induced by current are exclusive to metallic magnets, we theoretically predict that such phenomena can also be realized in magnetic insulators, specifically in the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$. We reveal that the displacement current driven by the THz electric field is able to generate a N{\'e}el spin-orbit torque in this insulating system. By introducing an alternative electric dipole order parameter arising from the dipole moment at $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ sites, we combine symmetry analysis with a Lagrangian approach and uncover that the displacement current couples to the antiferromagnetic spins and enables ultrafast control of antiferromagnetic order. The derived equations of motion show that this effect competes with the linear magnetoelectric response, offering a novel pathway for manipulating antiferromagnetic order in insulators. Our findings establish insulator antiferromagnets as a viable platform for electric field driven antiferromagnetic spintronics and provide general design principles for non-metallic spin-orbit torque materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning Landau free energy potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct Landau-like free energy potentials using a machine-learning approach. For concreteness, we focus on perovskite oxide PbTiO$_{3}$. We work with a training set obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic ''second-principles'' potential for PbTiO$_{3}$. We rely exclusively on data that would be experimentally accessible -- i.e., temperature-dependent polarization and strain, both with and without external electric fields and stresses applied --, to explore scenarios where the training set could be obtained from laboratory measurements. We introduce a scheme that allows us to identify optimal polynomial models of the temperature-dependent free energy surface, mapped as a function of the homogeneous electric polarization and homogeneous strain. Our results for PbTiO$_{3}$ show that a very simple polynomial -- where only two parameters depend linearly on temperature -- is sufficient to yield a correct description of the material's behavior. Remarkably, the obtained models also capture the subtle couplings by which elastic strain controls key features of ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_{3}$ -- i.e., the symmetry of the polar phase and the discontinuous character of the transition --, despite the fact that no effort was made to include such information in the training set. We emphasize the distinctive aspects of our methodology (which relies on an original form of validation step) by comparing it with the usual machine-learning approach for model construction. Our results illustrate how physically motivated models can have remarkable predictive power, even if they are derived from a limited amount of data. We argue that such ''third-principles'' models can be the basis for predictive macroscopic or mesoscopic simulations of ferroelectrics and other materials undergoing non-reconstructive structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Formation of Crystalline VO2 Domains in Porous 1 Nanocolumnar Thin Films for Thermochromic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of VO2 crystalline domains in amorphous substoichiometric nanocolumnar VOx thin films subjected to an oxidation process at temperatures below 300{\deg}C has been studied. It is obtained that values of [O]/[V] above 1.9 lead to the sole formation of V2O5 after oxidation, while values below 1.9 favor the formation of VO2, V3O7 and V2O5 crystalline domains for temperatures as low as 260{\deg}C. Moreover, it is found that the adsorption of oxygen and its incorporation into the film network produce a relevant volume expansion in a so-called swelling mechanism that makes pores shrink. Under some specific conditions, the low temperature oxidation does not only trigger the formation of VO2 domains but also a drastic reduction of oxygen-deficient amorphous VOx in the films, which clearly improves the overall transparency and thermochromic modulation capabilities. The changes in the optical and electrical properties of these films during the metal-insulator transition have been studied, finding the best performance when the stoichiometry of the film before oxidation is [O]/[V]=1.5 and the oxidation temperature 280{\deg}C. These conditions yield a relatively transparent coating that presents an optical modulation in the near-infrared range of nearly 50% and a drop of electrical resistivity of more than two orders of magnitude. A tentative model based on the volume increase experienced by film upon oxidation is proposed to link the structural/chemical features of the films and the formation of VO2 domains at such relatively low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced negative capacitance in La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ ferroelectric capacitor by tuning bias voltage pulse to induce intrinsic domain switching kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a remarkable enhancement of specific negative capacitance in multidomain La-doped Pb(Zr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$)O$_3$ (PLZT) ferroelectric capacitors when bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and timescale) induces switching of the ferroelectric domains following intrinsic switching kinetics associated with minimum energy barrier. This is because of emergence of maximum domain wall density during ``switching" of the domains. Domain configuration changes from such an ``optimum" state if higher or lower bias voltage is applied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation shows dependence of the domain wall density during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at a specific bias voltage amplitude. The radius of curvature of the resulting polarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage ($V_C$) also turns out to be depending on whether or not intrinsic switching kinetics is followed. All these results indicate a close correlation among the bias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain wall density during switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the transient negative capacitance. It may have important ramifications both in the context of physics behind negative capacitance in a multidomain ferroelectric capacitor and devices being developed by exploiting its advantages.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of amorphous thin films Tb-Co and Dy-Co with stoichiometry Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ and Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, deposited on naturally oxidized silicon Si (100) substrates. Samples with a thickness $d=50$ nm covered with a protective Au overlayer with a thickness $d_{\rm Au} =5 $ nm were produced using the pulsed laser deposition technique. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the presence of a crystallized Laves phase in the prepared materials. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature revealed ferrimagnetic behavior in both samples. We estimated the compensation temperature $T_{\rm comp}$ of the amorphous phase for Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ at 81.5 K and for Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$ at 88.5 K, while we found the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ of the crystallized Laves phases at 204.5 K and at 117 K, respectively. We investigated the magnetocaloric effect in a wide temperature range, covering $T_{\rm comp}$ of amorphous phases and $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ of crystallized Laves phases. The analysis for the magnetic field change of $\Delta \mu_0H=5$ T showed values of the magnetic entropy change of $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=4.9$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm comp}$ and $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=6.6$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$ for Tb$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, while for Dy$_{31}$Co$_{69}$, we determined the values of $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=35$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm comp}$ and $-\Delta S_{\rm M}=28$ mJ cm$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T_{\rm C,\ Laves}$.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent Photoluminescence and Raman Spectroscopy of Selenium Thin Film Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a elemental semiconductor for a range of optoelectronic and energy applications due to its irresistibly simple composition and favorable wide bandgap. However, its high volatility and low radiative efficiency make it challenging to assess structural and optoelectronic quality, calling for advanced, non-destructive characterization methods. In this work, we employ a closed-space encapsulation strategy to prevent degradation during measurement and enable sensitive probing of vibrational and optoelectronic properties. Using temperature-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate grown-in stress, vibrational dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in selenium thin films synthesized under nominally identical conditions across different laboratories. Our results reveal that short-range structural disorder is not intrinsic to the material, but highly sensitive to subtle processing variations, which strongly influence electron-phonon coupling and non-radiative recombination. We find that such structural disorder and grown-in stress likely promote the formation of extended defects, which act as dominant non-radiative recombination centers limiting carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic quality of selenium thin films can be significantly improved through precise control of synthesis and post-deposition treatments, outlining a clear pathway toward optimizing selenium-based thin film technologies through targeted control of crystallization dynamics and microstructural disorder.</description>

      <title>Electron Doping Stabilization of Highly-Polar Supertetragonal BaSnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Could electrons stabilize ferroelectric polarization in unpolarized system? Basically, electron doping was thought to be contrary to polarization due to the well-known picture that the screening effect on Coulomb interaction diminishes ferroelectric polarization. However, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism of stabilizing highly-polar supertetragonal BaSnO3 by electron doping. With moderate compressive strain applied, less than -5.5%, BaSnO3 exhibits stable nonpolarized normal tetragonal structure and an unstable supertetragonal state which is characterized with extremely large c/a ratio and giant polarization. We found that the band gap of the supertetragonal state is much smaller than the normal tetragonal state, with a difference around 1.2eV. Therefore, the energy of the doped electrons selectively favors the smaller gap supertetragonal state than the larger band gap normal tetragonal state, and the critical strain to stabilize the supertetragonal phase could be reduced by electron doping. This mechanism guarantees the controllable supertetragonal structures by electron doping and ensures the coexistence of giant polarization and conducting in high-mobility BaSnO3, and is promising to design high-mobility ferroelectrics conductor.</description>

      <title>Structural Distortions Control Scaling of Exciton Binding Energies in Two-Dimensional Ag/Bi Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional metal halide double perovskites such as Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibit pronounced excitonic effects due to their anisotropic electronic structure and chemical localization effects. Their two-dimensional derivatives, formed by inserting organic spacer molecules between perovskite layers, were expected to follow well-established trends seen in Pb-based 2D perovskites, namely, increasing exciton binding energies with decreasing layer thickness due to enhanced quantum and dielectric confinement. However, recent experimental and computational studies have revealed anomalous behavior in Ag/Bi-based 2D perovskites, where this trend is reversed. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation frameworks, we resolve this puzzle by systematically comparing experimental structures with idealized models designed to isolate the effects of octahedral distortions, interlayer separation, and stacking. We find that structural distortions, driven by directional Ag d orbital bonding, govern the momentum-space origin and character of the exciton, and are the primary cause of the observed non-monotonic trends. Furthermore, we explore how interlayer distance and stacking influence band gaps and exciton binding energies, showing that, despite different chemistry, the underlying confinement physics mirrors that of Pb-based 2D perovskites. Our results establish design principles for tuning excitonic properties in this broader class of layered, lead-free materials.</description>

      <title>Boosting Photodetection via Plasmonic Coupling in Quasi-2D Mixed-n Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Nanostripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising material for photodetection due to excellent optoelectronic properties, simple synthesis, and robust stability. Albeit, developing high-performance photodetectors based on low-dimensional quasi-2D metal halide perovskite nanoparticles remains challenging due to quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Several approaches have been employed to improve efficiency, with plasmonic nanostructures being among the most effective ones. The resonant energy transfer and coupling between plasmons and excitons play a vital role in enhancing device performance. Here, we demonstrate enhanced photodetection of quasi-2D perovskite nanostripes resulting from the incorporation of octadecanethiol (ODT) functionalized Ag nanostructure arrays (ANA). Using colloidal lithography, ANA were fabricated. Reflectance spectroscopy and finite element method (FEM) simulations show that ANA supports localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes that spectrally coincide with the absorption and emission band of the perovskite. This spectral overlap enables interesting coupling interactions between the excitons and plasmons. The ODT-functionalized ANA photodetectors exhibit weak to intermediate coupling, resulting in a photocurrent enhancement factor of 838 %. They achieve photoresponsivities of up to 70.41 mA W^-1, detectivities of 1.48*10^11 Jones and external quantum efficiencies of 21.55 %, which are approximately 10 times higher than those of the reference photodetector. We present an approach to optimize the plasmon-exciton coupling and non-radiative energy transfer for developing high-performance plasmonic-perovskite hybrid photodetectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushing dopant concentrations beyond the solubility limit in semiconductors -- a process known as hyperdoping -- has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for inducing superconductivity in cubic-diamond Si and SiGe materials. Additionally, previous studies have reported that several polytypes of Si may exhibit a type-I superconducting state under high pressure. In this work, we employ ground-state Density Functional Theory simulations to investigate the effects of both low and high B doping concentrations on the structural and thermodynamic properties of hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys, with a systematic comparison to their cubic-diamond counterparts. Our results highlight three key findings: (i) structural analysis confirms that the lattice parameters of SiGeB alloys adhere to a ternary Vegard's law, consistent with observations in cubic-diamond SiGe alloys. However, at high doping concentrations, B incorporation can locally disrupt the hexagonal symmetry, particularly in the presence of B clustering; (ii) dopant formation energy calculations reveal that B is thermodynamically more stable in the hexagonal phase than in the cubic phase across all Ge concentrations, regardless of the doping level; (iii) mixing enthalpy calculations demonstrate that hyperdoped hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys are thermodynamically stable across the full range of Ge compositions and that their tendency for hyperdoping is more favorable than that of cubic-diamond SiGe alloys. Taken together, these findings indicate that hyperdoping is experimentally viable in hexagonal-diamond SiGe alloys and, in light of previous evidence, position these materials as a promising platform for the exploration of superconductivity in group IV semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap. These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Material Fracture Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.</description>

Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic plasmons, making it a promising platform for nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with an emerging CMOS technology platform and it is widely deployed in high power and harsh environment electronics. This material is also attracting interest for quantum technologies through its crystal defects, which can act as spin-based qubits or single-photon sources. In this work, we assess the cryogenic performance of commercial power MOSFETs to evaluate their suitability for CMOS-compatible quantum electronics. We perform a statistical study of threshold voltage and subthreshold swing from 300 K down to 650 mK, focusing on reproducibility and variability. Our results show significant performance degradation at low temperatures, including large gate hysteresis, threshold voltage shifts, and subthreshold swing deterioration. These effects suggest instability in electrostatic control, likely due to carrier freeze-out and high interface trap density, which may pose challenges for the reliable use of this transistor technology towards the realisation of quantum devices or cryo-CMOS electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems, while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner, hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net magnetization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining symmetry analysis and direct density functional calculations including the spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that LaMn2Si2 is an M-type altermagnet. Our results predict a large anomalous Hall effect, with a non-zero xy component of -360 S/cm, accompanied by a pronounced magneto-optical response. Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn2Si2 is predicted to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm. These results suggest that silicates with general formula RM2Si2 can be an interesting platform for studying both altermagnetism and anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Superconducting coherence boosted by outer-layer metallic screening in multilayered cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multilayered high-Tc cuprates with three or more CuO2 layers per unit cell, the inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are spatially separated from the dopant layers and thus remain cleaner than the outer planes (OPs). While both interlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key factors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult to disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously. Here we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and three-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover an unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while the OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that more than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with minimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we experimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2 layer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen disorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer exhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent Bogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long regarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped cuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the Brillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results introduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the competition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding new light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers offer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials and idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>

      <title>On the influence of powder particle size on single-track formation in laser powder bed fusion of AlSi10Mg alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of single-track experiments conducted for different fractions of standard AlSi10Mg powder, which were sieved to achieve varying mean size of the particles. We observed strong differences in the melting behaviour of fractions at relatively low levels of input energy in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Namely, the remarkable particle size effect arises for the position of lack of fusion boundary, i.e. for the range of process parameters where the laser power becomes sufficient for complete through-thickness melting of the powder layer at given laser scanning speed. We established that this boundary corresponds to an approximately constant linear energy density at low levels of Peclet number (Pe &lt; 2), while the constant enthalpy density defines this boundary at the higher levels (Pe &gt; 2). Specifically, when the mean particle size ranges from 28 to 64 microns, the required linear energy density for stable track formation ranges from 50 to 167 J/m and the nominal enthalpy density ranges from 4.4 to 15 J/mm^3. Based on the scaling law analysis and numerical simulations, we show that observed phenomena can be attributed to the change of absorptivity of powder layer, which depends on particle size and packing density. Also, we show that the values of absorptivity identified based on the analysis of position of lack of fusion boundary (0.13-0.38 for powder size 64-28 microns) correlate well with those found from the analysis of melt pool width in the formed single-tracks.</description>

      <title>Conical diffraction of the synchrotron beam to probe the efficiency and morphology of blazed gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for blazed gratings. In grazing incidence geometry, one can measure both the conical diffraction and the diffuse scattering on the grating simultaneously in a single scattering pattern. The sensitivity of scattering patterns to the structure of the blazed gratings is evaluated. The diffraction component of the pattern is shown to be sensitive to the average groove profile of the gratings. Meanwhile, the diffuse scattering depends on the roughness morphology of the reflective surface of blazed gratings. These findings are supported by numerical simulations. The simulations were performed using several rigorous solvers for the Helmholtz equations, and with a perturbation theory. The analysis relies on synchrotron data, as well as data from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The aim of this article is to draw the attention of the optical community to the synchrotron measurements as a nanometrology tool for the modern optical elements.</description>

Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves in nematic domains using dark-field X-ray microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.</description>

      <title>Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.</description>

Abstract: An intense femtosecond-laser excitation of a solid induces highly nonthermal conditions. In materials like silicon, laser-induced bond-softening leads to a highly incoherent ionic motion and eventually nonthermal melting. But is this outcome an inevitable consequence, or can it be controlled? Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystalline silicon after timed multiple femtosecond-laser pulse excitations with fluence above the nonthermal melting threshold. Our results demonstrate an excitation mechanism that pauses nonthermal melting and creates a metastable state instead, with an electronic structure similar to the ground state. This mechanism can be generalized to other materials, potentially enabling structural and/or electronic transitions to metastable phases in the high-excitation regime. In addition, our approach could be used to switch off nonthermal contributions in experiments, allowing reliable electron-phonon coupling constants to be obtained more easily.</description>

Abstract: Skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric materials are believed to occur due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu2Si2 by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q-vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu2Si2. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu2Si2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.</description>

Abstract: Although magnetoelectric effects in metals are usually neglected, assuming that applied electric fields are screened by free charge carriers, the skin depth, defining the penetration depth of the fields, is non-zero and for THz electric fields typically reaches 400 nm. Hence, if the thickness of an antiferromagnetic film is of the order of tens of nm, electric field induced effects cannot be neglected. Here, we theoretically study the THz electric field induced spin dynamics in the metallic antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$, whose spin arrangements allow it to exhibit a linear magnetoelectric effect. We show that the THz magnetoelectric torque in metallic antiferromagnets is proportional to the time derivative of the polarization induced by the THz electric field. Our simulations reveal that the magnetoelectric driven spin dynamics is indeed not negligible, and for a fair explanation of previously published experimental results in $\mathrm{Mn}_{2}\mathrm{Au}$ competition between THz magnetoelectric and N\'eel spin-orbit torques must be taken into account. Thus, it is shown that even in metallic antiferromagnets the THz magnetoelectric effect on spins can be strong and thus cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>Listen! It's a phase transition. The sound of a shape-memory alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape-memory alloys exhibit a solid-to-solid phase transition that involves a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure and is responsible for their remarkable properties and numerous technological applications. Here, we propose a simple experiment that analyzes the sound emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures as it undergoes a transition between its austenite and martensite phases. We show that the phase transition, which occurs slightly above room temperature, can be qualitatively detected by the ear and quantitatively described using a very simple experimental setup and sound analysis tools. Such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual and engaging way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions, that is suitable for undergraduate courses.</description>

      <title>Solution-Based Fabrication of High-Performance K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ Thin Films for Surface Haptics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ is among the most promising lead-free piezoelectrics. While its sputtered films match the performance of the champion piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$, reproducible processing of high-quality and time-stable solution-processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films remains challenging. Here, we report 1 $\mu$m-thick Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films prepared through a chemical solution deposition process, which have perfectly dense microstructure and uniform composition across their thickness. The films exhibit a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient ($e_{31,f} = -15.4$ C/m$^2$), high dielectric permittivity ($\varepsilon_r \approx 920$), low dielectric losses ($\tan\delta = 0.05$) and can withstand electric fields up to at least 1 MV/cm. The functional properties show excellent stability over time, and the synthesis process is reproducible. Furthermore, a surface acoustic haptic device is demonstrated by using K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ thin-film actuators. The results demonstrate the high potential of Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_3$ films to become a replacement for lead-based Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ films in piezoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twists by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Our findings reveal rich dynamical responses spanning single- and multi-pulse twist angle control to (quasi)stable dynamical trajectories, and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. Aided by classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moir\'e electronics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

      <title>Tuning the magnetic properties of the spin-split antiferromagnet MnTe through pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hexagonal antiferromagnet MnTe has attracted enormous interest as a prototypical example of a spin-compensated magnet in which the combination of crystal and spin symmetries lifts the spin degeneracy of the electron bands without the need for spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon called non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS). Subgroups of NRSS are determined by the specific spin-interconverting symmetry that connects the two opposite-spin sublattices. In MnTe, this symmetry is rotation, leading to the subgroup with spin splitting away from the Brillouin zone center, often called altermagnetism. MnTe also has the largest spontaneous magnetovolume effect of any known antiferromagnet, implying strong coupling between the magnetic moment and volume. This magnetostructural coupling offers a potential knob for tuning the spin-splitting properties of MnTe. Here, we use neutron diffraction with $\textit{in situ}$ applied pressure to determine the effects of pressure on the magnetic properties of MnTe and further explore this magnetostructural coupling. We find that applying pressure significantly increases the N\'eel temperature but decreases the ordered magnetic moment. We explain this as a consequence of strengthened magnetic exchange interactions under pressure, resulting in higher $T_\mathrm{N}$, with a simultaneous reduction of the local moment of individual Mn atoms, described here via density functional theory. This reflects the increased orbital hybridization and electron delocalization with pressure. These results show that the magnetic properties of MnTe can be controlled by pressure, opening the door to improved properties for spintronic applications through tuning via physical or chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Passivation Effects on Spatially Resolved Charge Trap Densities in Si(100)-SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As silicon-based devices continue to shrink to the nanoscale, traps at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface pose increasing challenges to device performance. These traps reduce channel carrier mobility and shift threshold voltages in integrated circuits, and introduce charge noise in quantum systems, reducing their coherence times. Knowledge of the precise location of such traps aids in understanding their influence on device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (fm-AFM) allows the detection of individual traps. We use this to study how sample preparation, specifically the introduction of a buried hydrogen termination layer, and post-processing annealing in forming gas (N$_2$+H$_2$), affects the density of donor-like traps in Si(100)-SiO$_2$ systems. We spatially map and quantify traps in both conventionally prepared ("pristine") silicon samples and those processed under ultra-high vacuum for hydrogen resist lithography (HRL). We confirm previous studies demonstrating hydrogen passivation of traps and find that hydrogen termination further reduces the donor-like trap density. We also observe a significant reduction in two-level donor-like traps in the hydrogen-terminated samples compared to pristine silicon samples. These findings suggest that HRL-prepared silicon may offer advantages for high-performance nanoscale and atomic-scale devices due to reduced trap densities.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the cofactor conditions: Elimination of transition layers in compound domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions necessary for the elimination of transition layers at interfaces involving compound domains, extending the classical framework of cofactor conditions. Although cofactor conditions enable stress-free phase boundaries between Type I/II domains and austenite, their applicability to compound domains has remained limited. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to characterize all compatible interfaces, highlighting the fundamental importance of the commutation property among martensitic variants. By establishing necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions, referred to as extreme compatibility conditions, we demonstrate the simultaneous elimination of transition layers at phase interfaces for both Type I/II and compound laminates, across all volume fractions of the martensitic variants. We also investigate the possibility of achieving supercompatibility in non-conventional twins, recently observed in the NiMnGa system. The focus of our work is on cubic-to-orthorhombic and cubic-to-monoclinic~II phase transformations, for which the extreme compatibility conditions are explicitly derived and systematically analyzed. The theory predicts novel zero-elastic-energy microstructures, including an increased number of triple clusters, spearhead-shaped martensitic nuclei, stress-free inclusions of austenite within martensite, and distinctive four-fold martensitic clusters. This significantly expands the possible modes of forming stress-free interfaces between phases and reveals new energy-minimizing microstructures that can facilitate the nucleation of martensite within austenite and vice versa. These configurations highlight significant enhancements in transformation reversibility and material durability, guiding the rational design of next-generation shape memory alloys with optimized functional properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co partitioning to the {\gamma} matrix on the microstructural stablity of a Ti-rich Ni-Base Superalloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microstructural stability and mechanical properties of superalloys at high temperatures are significantly influenced by the composition and nature of the solutes they contain. Most of the alloys with high solvus temperature have higher gamma prime coarsening resistance, while the larger lattice misfit is attributed to higher gamma prime coarsening rate. In this work, we explore the influence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical properties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich Ni-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of partitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes across the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening resistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in the Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime solvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better microstructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and CALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma matrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the gamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime coarsening behavior in the alloy. The observed behavior was rationlised by the proposition of a simplistic unified coarsening rate expression that successfully decouples thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. Additionally, we also observe that the gamma prime volume fraction dominates over the gamma prime precipitate size on the 0.2% yield strength (YS) of the alloys.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Odd-parity Magnetism in Conventional Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have drawn growing attention on non-relativistic odd-parity magnetism in the wake of altermagnets. Nevertheless, odd-parity spin splitting is often believed to appear in non-collinear magnetic configurations. Here, using symmetry arguments and effective model analysis, we show that Floquet engineering offers a universal strategy for achieving odd-parity magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) collinear antiferromagnets under irradiation of periodic driving light fields such as circularly polarized light, elliptically polarized light, and bicircular light. A comprehensive classification of potential candidates for collinear monolayer or bilayer antiferromagnets is established. Strikingly, the light-induced odd-parity spin splitting can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the crystalline symmetry or the polarization state of incident light, enabling the reversal or conversion of spin-splitting. By combining first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we present illustrative examples of 2D collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials to verify the light-induced odd-parity magnetism. Our work not only offers a powerful approach for uniquely achieving odd-parity spin-splitting with high tunability, but also expands the potential of Floquet engineering in designing unconventional compensated magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to $(S = 3/2, I = 7/2)$, $(S = 1, I = 7/2)$, and $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.</description>

      <title>Polarized Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides is a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, hosting exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, recent experimental results on HgS reports a new superconducting phase at 21 GPa, whose origin is unknown. In this letter we theoretically investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and the emergence of superconductivity in the rock salt phase. Remarkably, we discover that the rock salt phase hosts a two-gap superconducting phase originating from distinct Fermi surfaces. The unusually high critical temperature of 11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic approximation. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconductivity is observed.</description>
