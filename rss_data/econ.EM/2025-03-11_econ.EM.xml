      <title>Functional Linear Projection and Impulse Response Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes econometric methods for studying how economic variables respond to function-valued shocks. Our methods are developed based on linear projection estimation of predictive regression models with a function-valued predictor and other control variables. We show that the linear projection coefficient associated with the functional variable allows for the impulse response interpretation in a functional structural vector autoregressive model under a certain identification scheme, similar to well-known Sims' (1972) causal chain, but with nontrivial complications in our functional setup. A novel estimator based on an operator Schur complement is proposed and its asymptotic properties are studied. We illustrate its empirical applicability with two examples involving functional variables: economy sentiment distributions and functional monetary policy shocks.</description>

      <title>A primer on optimal transport for causal inference with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of optimal transportation has developed into a powerful and elegant framework for comparing probability distributions, with wide-ranging applications in all areas of science. The fundamental idea of analyzing probabilities by comparing their underlying state space naturally aligns with the core idea of causal inference, where understanding and quantifying counterfactual states is paramount. Despite this intuitive connection, explicit research at the intersection of optimal transport and causal inference is only beginning to develop. Yet, many foundational models in causal inference have implicitly relied on optimal transport principles for decades, without recognizing the underlying connection. Therefore, the goal of this review is to offer an introduction to the surprisingly deep existing connections between optimal transport and the identification of causal effects with observational data -- where optimal transport is not just a set of potential tools, but actually builds the foundation of model assumptions. As a result, this review is intended to unify the language and notation between different areas of statistics, mathematics, and econometrics, by pointing out these existing connections, and to explore novel problems and directions for future work in both areas derived from this realization.</description>

      <title>On a new robust method of inference for general time series models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel logistic quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (LQMLE) for general parametric time series models. Compared to the classical Gaussian QMLE and existing robust estimations, it enjoys many distinctive advantages, such as robustness in respect of distributional misspecification and heavy-tailedness of the innovation, more resiliency to outliers, smoothness and strict concavity of the log logistic quasi-likelihood function, and boundedness of the influence function among others. Under some mild conditions, we establish the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the LQMLE. Moreover, we propose a new and vital parameter identifiability condition to ensure desirable asymptotics of the LQMLE. Further, based on the LQMLE, we consider the Wald test and the Lagrange multiplier test for the unknown parameters, and derive the limiting distributions of the corresponding test statistics. The applicability of our methodology is demonstrated by several time series models, including DAR, GARCH, ARMA-GARCH, DTARMACH, and EXPAR. Numerical simulation studies are carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of our methodology, and an empirical example is analyzed to illustrate its usefulness.</description>

      <title>Maximal Inequalities for Separately Exchangeable Empirical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives new maximal inequalities for empirical processes associated with separately exchangeable random arrays. For fixed index dimension $K\ge 1$, we establish a global maximal inequality bounding the $q$-th moment ($q\in[1,\infty)$) of the supremum of these processes. We also obtain a refined local maximal inequality controlling the first absolute moment of the supremum. Both results are proved for a general pointwise measurable function class. Our approach uses a new technique partitioning the index set into transversal groups, decoupling dependencies and enabling more sophisticated higher moment bounds.</description>
