      <title>Howe duality over finite fields III: full computation and the Gurevich-Howe conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third paper in a series on type I Howe duality for finite fields, we give a complete description of the restriction of the oscillator representation over a finite field to products of dual pairs of symplectic and orthogonal groups in all cases that occur. In particular, this gives an inductive construction of all irreducible complex representations of finite symplectic and orthogonal groups. We also give a proof of the Gurevich-Howe rank and exhaustion conjectures for type I pairs.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of hereditary artin algebras of finite representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a hereditary artin algebra of finite representation type. We first determine all hammocks in the Auslander-Reiten quiver $\GaH$ of $\mmod H$, the category of finitely generated left $H$-modules. This enables us to obtain an effective method to construct $\GaH$ by simply viewing the ext-quiver of $H$. As easy applications, we compute the numbers of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects in $\mmod H$ and the associated cluster category $\mathscr{C}_H$, as well as the nilpotencies of the radicals of $\mmod H\hspace{-.4pt},$ $\hspace{-.5pt} D^{\hspace{.5pt}b\hspace{-.6pt}}(\hspace{-.5pt}\mmod H\hspace{-.5pt})$ and $\mathscr{C}_H$.</description>

      <title>On sporadic symmetry breaking operators for principal series representations of the de Sitter and Lorentz groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and classify all differential symmetry breaking operators $\mathbb{D}_{\lambda, \nu}^{N,m}: C^\infty(S^3, \mathcal{V}_\lambda^{2N+1})\rightarrow C^\infty(S^2, \mathcal{L}_{m, \nu})$ between principal series representations with respect to the restriction $SO_0(4,1) \downarrow SO_0(3,1)$ when the parameters satisfy the condition $|m| &gt; N$. In this case we also prove a localness theorem, namely, all symmetry breaking operators between the principal series representations above are necessarily differential operators. In addition, we show that all these symmetry breaking operators are sporadic in the sense of T. Kobayashi, that is, they cannot be obtained by residue formulas of distributional kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an additive subcategory of left $\Lambda$-modules, we establish relations of the orthogonal classes of $\mathscr{C}$ and (co)res $\widetilde{\mathscr{C}}$ under separable equivalences. As applications, we obtain that the (one-sided) Gorenstein category and Wakamatsu tilting module are preserved under separable equivalences. Furthermore, we discuss when $G_{C}$-projective (injective) modules and Auslander (Bass) class with respect to $C$ are invariant under separable equivalences.</description>

      <title>Rational structures on quivers and a generalization of Gelfand's equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of rational structure on a quiver and associated representations to establish a coherent framework for studying quiver representations in separable field extensions. This notion is linked to a refinement of the notion of $K$-species, which we term \'etale $K$-species: We establish a categorical anti-equivalence between the category of $K$-rational quivers and that of \'etale $K$-species, which extends to an equivalence of their respective representation categories. For $K$-rational quivers there is a canonical notion of base change, which suggests a corresponding notion of base change for (\'etale) $K$-species which we elaborate. As a primary application, we generalize Gelfand's celebrated equivalence between certain blocks of Harish-Chandra modules for $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and representations of the Gelfand quiver to a rational setting. To this end, we define a $\mathbb{Q}$-rational structure on the Gelfand quiver and its representations. A key technical tool, which we call unipotent stabilization, is developed to construct the functor from certain rational Harish-Chandra modules to nilpotent rational quiver representations. We prove that this functor is an equivalence. A similar result is established for the cyclic quiver. A notable consequence of this rational framework is that the defining relation of the Gelfand quiver becomes superfluous when working over fields not containing $\sqrt{-1}$. This allows us to recast our results in the language of $\mathbb{Q}$-species without relations.</description>

      <title>Truncated symbols of differential symmetry breaking operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations, which generalizes the symbol $\mathrm{symb}(\mathbb{D})$ for abelian nilpotent radicals to the non-abelian case. The inverse $\mathrm{symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{symb}_0$ enables one to perform a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical.
  As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</description>

      <title>Monomial arrow removal and the finitistic dimension conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the monomial arrow removal operation for bound quiver algebras, and show that it is a novel reduction technique for determining the finiteness of the finitistic dimension. Our approach first develops a general method within the theory of abelian category cleft extensions. We then demonstrate that the specific conditions of this method are satisfied by the cleft extensions arising from strict monomial arrow removals. This crucial connection is established through the application of non-commutative Gr\"{o}bner bases in the sense of Green. The theory is illustrated with various concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and symmetry breaking operators for $U_q(sl_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents explicit formulas for intertwining operators of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$ acting on tensor products of Verma modules. We express a first set of intertwining operators (the holographic operators) in terms of the little $q$-Jacobi polynomials, and we obtain for the dual set (the symmetry breaking operators) a $q$-deformation of the Rankin--Cohen operators. The Verma modules are realised on polynomial spaces and, interestingly, we find along the way the need to work with non-commuting variables. Explicit connections are given with the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U_q(sl_2)$ expressed with the $q$-Hahn polynomials.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that for any finite dimensional representation of a prime order group over the field of rational numbers, polynomial invariants of degree at most $3$ separate the orbits. A result providing an upper degree bound for separating invariants for representations of finite abelian groups over algebraically closed base fields of non-modular characteristic is generalized for the case of base fields that are not algebraically closed (like the fields of real or rational numbers).</description>

      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and respresentation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,...,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. But this lattice has received no attention to our knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we determine its M\"obius function, show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2, or congruent to 1 modulo d.</description>

Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers on type I Howe duality for finite fields, concerning the restriction of an oscillator representation of the symplectic group to a product of a symplectic and an orthogonal group. The goal of the series is describing this restriction completely. In this first paper, we construct the correspondence in the two so called stable ranges, where the rank of one of the factors is large enough with respect to the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a multiplication formula for cluster characters induced by generating extensions in a gentle algebra A, generalizing a result of Cerulli Irelli, Esposito, Franzen, Reineke. In the case where A is the gentle algebra of a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface, this provides a representation-theoretic interpretation of the exchange relations in the cluster algebra with principal coefficients in T. As an application, we interpret a formula that relates cluster variables of type B to cluster variables of type A in the symmetric module category of the algebras arising from special triangulations of a regular polygon.</description>

      <title>Global representation theory: Homological foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the groups belonging to some collection of finite groups $\mathscr{U}$. Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. We show that $G$ possesses a non-trivial irreducible character of degree not divisible by $p$ nor $q$ lying in both the principal $p$- and $q$-block whenever $G$ is one of the following: an alternating group $\mathfrak{A}_n$, $n\geq 4$, a symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, $n\geq 3$, or a finite simple classical group of type A, B, or C, defined in characteristic distinct from $p$ and $q$. This extends earlier results of Navarro-Rizo-Schaeffer Fry for $2\in\{p,q\}$, and in particular completes the proof of an instance of a conjecture of the same authors, e.g., in the case of symmetric and alternating groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study some families of groups whose irreducible characters take values on quadratic extensions of the rationals. We focus mostly on a generalization of inverse semi-rational groups, which we call uniformly semi-rational groups. Moreover, we associate to every finite group two invariants, called rationality and semi-rationality of the group. They measure respectively how far a group is from being rational and how much uniformly rational it is. We determine the possible values that these invariants may take for finite nilpotent groups. We also classify the fields that can occur as the field generated by the character values of a finite nilpotent group.</description>

Abstract: We consider Brauer's 14th Problem in the context of "Real" structures on finite groups and their antilinear representations. The problem is to count the number of characters of each different type using "group theory". While Brauer's original problem deals only with three types (real, complex and quaternionic), here we consider the ten types coming from Dyson's tenfold way.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound for The Number of Zeros in The Character Table of The Symmetric Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ be the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. Let $Z(N)$ be the number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$, and $Z_{t}(N)$ be defined as
  $$
  Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \; \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}.
  $$
  We establish the bound
  $$
  Z(N) \geq \frac{2p(N)^{2}}{1.01e \log N} \left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\log N}\right)\right)
  $$
  where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. Also, we give lower bounds for $Z_t(N)$ in different ranges of $t$.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangianity of $p$-supports of holonomic D-modules and $q$-D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem. We also discuss potential applications to quantizations of symplectic singularities and to quantum cluster algebras.</description>
