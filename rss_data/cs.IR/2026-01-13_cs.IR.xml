      <title>Towards Building efficient Routed systems for Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-interaction retrieval models like ColBERT achieve superior accuracy by enabling token-level interactions, but their computational cost hinders scalability and integration with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS). We introduce FastLane, a novel retrieval framework that dynamically routes queries to their most informative representations, eliminating redundant token comparisons. FastLane employs a learnable routing mechanism optimized alongside the embedding model, leveraging self-attention and differentiable selection to maximize efficiency. Our approach reduces computational complexity by up to 30x while maintaining competitive retrieval performance. By bridging late-interaction models with ANNS, FastLane enables scalable, low-latency retrieval, making it feasible for large-scale applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering platforms. This work opens pathways for multi-lingual, multi-modal, and long-context retrieval, pushing the frontier of efficient and adaptive information retrieval.</description>

      <title>PixRec: Leveraging Visual Context for Next-Item Prediction in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for usage in sequential recommendation tasks through text-only models, which combine advanced prompt design, contrastive alignment, and fine-tuning on downstream domain-specific data. While effective, these approaches overlook the rich visual information present in many real-world recommendation scenarios, particularly in e-commerce. This paper proposes PixRec - a vision-language framework that incorporates both textual attributes and product images into the recommendation pipeline. Our architecture leverages a vision-language model backbone capable of jointly processing image-text sequences, maintaining a dual-tower structure and mixed training objective while aligning multi-modal feature projections for both item-item and user-item interactions. Using the Amazon Reviews dataset augmented with product images, our experiments demonstrate $3\times$ and 40% improvements in top-rank and top-10 rank accuracy over text-only recommenders respectively, indicating that visual features can help distinguish items with similar textual descriptions. Our work outlines future directions for scaling multi-modal recommenders training, enhancing visual-text feature fusion, and evaluating inference-time performance. This work takes a step toward building software systems utilizing visual information in sequential recommendation for real-world applications like e-commerce.</description>

      <title>L-RAG: Balancing Context and Retrieval with Entropy-Based Lazy Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for grounding Large Language Model outputs in factual knowledge, effectively mitigating hallucinations. However, conventional RAG systems operate under a "retrieve-always" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p &lt; 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal. L-RAG offers a practical, training-free approach toward more efficient RAG deployment, providing system architects with a configurable knob to balance accuracy and throughput requirements.</description>

      <title>Industrial Semantics-Aware Digital Twins: A Hybrid Graph Matching Approach for Asset Administration Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard provides a structured and machine-readable representation of industrial assets, their semantic comparability remains a major challenge, particularly when different vocabularies and modeling practices are used. Engineering would benefit from retrieving existing AAS models that are similar to the target in order to reuse submodels, parameters, and metadata. In practice, however, heterogeneous vocabularies and divergent modeling conventions hinder automated, content-level comparison across AAS. This paper proposes a hybrid graph matching approach to enable semantics-aware comparison of Digital Twin representations. The method combines rule-based pre-filtering using SPARQL with embedding-based similarity calculation leveraging RDF2vec to capture both structural and semantic relationships between AAS models. This contribution provides a foundation for enhanced discovery, reuse, and automated configuration in Digital Twin networks.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Native Recommendation Potential: LLM-Based Generative Recommendation via Structured Term Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the vast open-world knowledge and understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop general-purpose, semantically-aware recommender systems has emerged as a pivotal research direction in generative recommendation. However, existing methods face bottlenecks in constructing item identifiers. Text-based methods introduce LLMs' vast output space, leading to hallucination, while methods based on Semantic IDs (SIDs) encounter a semantic gap between SIDs and LLMs' native vocabulary, requiring costly vocabulary expansion and alignment training. To address this, this paper introduces Term IDs (TIDs), defined as a set of semantically rich and standardized textual keywords, to serve as robust item identifiers. We propose GRLM, a novel framework centered on TIDs, employs Context-aware Term Generation to convert item's metadata into standardized TIDs and utilizes Integrative Instruction Fine-tuning to collaboratively optimize term internalization and sequential recommendation. Additionally, Elastic Identifier Grounding is designed for robust item mapping. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRLM significantly outperforms baselines across multiple scenarios, pointing a promising direction for generalizable and high-performance generative recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Applying Embedding-Based Retrieval to Airbnb Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of Airbnb search is to match guests with the ideal accommodation that fits their travel needs. This is a challenging problem, as popular search locations can have around a hundred thousand available homes, and guests themselves have a wide variety of preferences. Furthermore, the launch of new product features, such as \textit{flexible date search,} significantly increased the number of eligible homes per search query. As such, there is a need for a sophisticated retrieval system which can provide high-quality candidates with low latency in a way that integrates with the overall ranking stack.
  This paper details our journey to build an efficient and high-quality retrieval system for Airbnb search. We describe the key unique challenges we encountered when implementing an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for a two sided marketplace like Airbnb -- such as the dynamic nature of the inventory, a lengthy user funnel with multiple stages, and a variety of product surfaces. We cover unique insights when modeling the retrieval problem, how to build robust evaluation systems, and design choices for online serving. The EBR system was launched to production and powers several use-cases such as regular search, flexible date and promotional emails for marketing campaigns. The system demonstrated statistically-significant improvements in key metrics, such as booking conversion, via A/B testing.</description>

      <title>FinCARDS: Card-Based Analyst Reranking for Financial Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial question answering (QA) over long corporate filings requires evidence to satisfy strict constraints on entities, financial metrics, fiscal periods, and numeric values. However, existing LLM-based rerankers primarily optimize semantic relevance, leading to unstable rankings and opaque decisions on long documents. We propose FinCards, a structured reranking framework that reframes financial evidence selection as constraint satisfaction under a finance-aware schema. FinCards represents filing chunks and questions using aligned schema fields (entities, metrics, periods, and numeric spans), enabling deterministic field-level matching. Evidence is selected via a multi-stage tournament reranking with stability-aware aggregation, producing auditable decision traces. Across two corporate filing QA benchmarks, FinCards substantially improves early-rank retrieval over both lexical and LLM-based reranking baselines, while reducing ranking variance, without requiring model fine-tuning or unpredictable inference budgets. Our code is available at https://github.com/XanderZhou2022/FINCARDS.</description>

      <title>ReinPool: Reinforcement Learning Pooling Multi-Vector Embeddings for Retrieval System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector embedding models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for document retrieval, preserving fine-grained visual and textual details through token-level representations. However, this expressiveness comes at a staggering cost: storing embeddings for every token inflates index sizes by over $1000\times$ compared to single-vector approaches, severely limiting scalability. We introduce \textbf{ReinPool}, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to dynamically filter and pool multi-vector embeddings into compact, retrieval-optimized representations. By training with an inverse retrieval objective and NDCG-based rewards, ReinPool identifies and retains only the most discriminative vectors without requiring manual importance annotations. On the Vidore V2 benchmark across three vision-language embedding models, ReinPool compresses multi-vector representations by $746$--$1249\times$ into single vectors while recovering 76--81\% of full multi-vector retrieval performance. Compared to static mean pooling baselines, ReinPool achieves 22--33\% absolute NDCG@3 improvement, demonstrating that learned selection significantly outperforms heuristic aggregation.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Behavior Multi-Task Recommendation via Behavior-informed Graph Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) aims to improve the performance w.r.t. the target behavior (i.e., purchase) by leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., click, favourite). However, in real-world scenarios, a recommendation method often needs to process different types of behaviors and generate personalized lists for each task (i.e., each behavior type). Such a new recommendation problem is referred to as multi-behavior multi-task recommendation (MMR). So far, the most powerful MBR methods usually model multi-behavior interactions using a cascading graph paradigm. Although significant progress has been made in optimizing the performance of the target behavior, it often neglects the performance of auxiliary behaviors. To compensate for the deficiencies of the cascading paradigm, we propose a novel solution for MMR, i.e., behavior-informed graph embedding learning (BiGEL). Specifically, we first obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings by using a cascading graph paradigm. Subsequently, we introduce three key modules to improve the performance of the model. The cascading gated feedback (CGF) module enables a feedback-driven optimization process by integrating feedback from the target behavior to refine the auxiliary behaviors preferences. The global context enhancement (GCE) module integrates the global context to maintain the user's overall preferences, preventing the loss of key preferences due to individual behavior graph modeling. Finally, the contrastive preference alignment (CPA) module addresses the potential changes in user preferences during the cascading process by aligning the preferences of the target behaviors with the global preferences through contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our BiGEL compared with ten very competitive methods.</description>

      <title>RLPO: Residual Listwise Preference Optimization for Long-Context Review Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Review ranking is pivotal in e-commerce for prioritizing diagnostic and authentic feedback from the deluge of user-generated content. While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification. Experiments show RLPO improves NDCG@k over strong pointwise and listwise baselines and remains robust as list length increases.</description>

      <title>Loci Similes: A Benchmark for Extracting Intertextualities in Latin Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing connections between historical texts is an important part of intertextual research, enabling scholars to reconstruct the virtual library of a writer and identify the sources influencing their creative process. These intertextual links manifest in diverse forms, ranging from direct verbatim quotations to subtle allusions and paraphrases disguised by morphological variation. Language models offer a promising path forward due to their capability of capturing semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. However, the development of new methods for this task is held back by the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and easy-to-use datasets. We address this gap by introducing Loci Similes, a benchmark for Latin intertextuality detection comprising of a curated dataset of ~172k text segments containing 545 expert-verified parallels linking Late Antique authors to a corpus of classical authors. Using this data, we establish baselines for retrieval and classification of intertextualities with state-of-the-art LLMs.</description>

      <title>GAP-Net: Calibrating User Intent via Gated Adaptive Progressive Learning for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential user behavior modeling is pivotal for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction yet is hindered by three intrinsic bottlenecks: (1) the "Attention Sink" phenomenon, where standard Softmax compels the model to allocate probability mass to noisy behaviors; (2) the Static Query Assumption, which overlooks dynamic shifts in user intent driven by real-time contexts; and (3) Rigid View Aggregation, which fails to adaptively weight heterogeneous temporal signals according to the decision context. To bridge these gaps, we propose GAP-Net (Gated Adaptive Progressive Network), a unified framework establishing a "Triple Gating" architecture to progressively refine information from micro-level features to macro-level views. GAP-Net operates through three integrated mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Sparse-Gated Attention (ASGA) employs micro-level gating to enforce sparsity, effectively suppressing massive noise activations; (2) Gated Cascading Query Calibration (GCQC) dynamically aligns user intent by bridging real-time triggers and long-term memories via a meso-level cascading channel; and (3) Context-Gated Denoising Fusion (CGDF) performs macro-level modulation to orchestrate the aggregation of multi-view sequences. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that GAP-Net achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior robustness against interaction noise and intent drift.</description>

      <title>AptaFind: A lightweight local interface for automated aptamer curation from scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aptamer researchers face a literature landscape scattered across publications, supplements, and databases, with each search consuming hours that could be spent at the bench. AptaFind transforms this navigation problem through a three-tier intelligence architecture that recognizes research mining is a spectrum, not a binary success or failure. The system delivers direct sequence extraction when possible, curated research leads when extraction fails, and exhaustive literature discovery for additional confidence. By combining local language models for semantic understanding with deterministic algorithms for reliability, AptaFind operates without cloud dependencies or subscription barriers. Validation across 300 University of Texas Aptamer Database targets demonstrates 84 % with some literature found, 84 % with curated research leads, and 79 % with a direct sequence extraction, at a laptop-compute rate of over 900 targets an hour. The platform proves that even when direct sequence extraction fails, automation can still deliver the actionable intelligence researchers need by rapidly narrowing the search to high quality references.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Framework Development for Public Space Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public space quality assessment lacks systematic methodologies that integrate factors across diverse spatial typologies while maintaining context-specific relevance. Current approaches remain fragmented within disciplinary boundaries, limiting comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis across different space types. This study develops a systematic, data-driven framework for assessing public space quality through the algorithmic integration of empirical research findings. Using a 7-phase methodology, we transform 1,207 quality factors extracted from 157 peer-reviewed studies into a validated hierarchical taxonomy spanning six public space typologies: urban spaces, open spaces, green spaces, parks and waterfronts, streets and squares, and public facilities. The methodology combines semantic analysis, cross-typology distribution analysis, and domain knowledge integration to address terminological variations and functional relationships across space types. The resulting framework organizes 1,029 unique quality factors across 14 main categories and 66 subcategories, identifying 278 universal factors applicable across all space types, 397 space-specific factors unique to particular typologies, and 124 cross-cutting factors serving multiple functions. Framework validation demonstrates systematic consistency in factor organization and theoretical alignment with established research on public spaces. This research provides a systematic methodology for transforming empirical public space research into practical assessment frameworks, supporting evidence-based policy development, design quality evaluation, and comparative analysis across diverse urban contexts.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Authoring for Transparent, Data-Driven Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce _transparent documents_, interactive web-based scholarly articles which allow readers to explore the relationship to the underlying data by hovering over fragments of text, and present an LLM-based tool for authoring transparent documents, building on recent developments in data provenance for general-purpose programming languages. As a target platform, our implementation uses Fluid, an open source programming language with a provenance-tracking runtime. Our agent-based tool supports a human author during the creation of transparent documents, identifying fragments of text which can be computed from data, such as numerical values selected from records or computed by aggregations like sum and mean, comparatives and superlatives like _better than_ and _largest_, trend-adjectives like _growing_, and similar quantitative or semi-quantitative phrases, and then attempts to synthesise a suitable Fluid query over the data which generates the target string. The resulting expression is inserted into the article's web page, turning the static text fragment into an interactable data-driven element able to reveal the data that underwrites the natural language claim. We evaluate our approach on a subset of SciGen, an open source dataset consisting of tables from scientific articles and their corresponding descriptions, which we extend with hand-generated counterfactual test cases to evaluate how well machine-generated expressions generalise. Our results show that gpt4o is often able to synthesise compound expressions extensionally compatible with our gold solutions.</description>

      <title>RAIRS: Optimizing Redundant Assignment and List Layout for IVF-Based ANN Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IVF is one of the most widely used ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search) methods in vector databases. The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement.</description>

      <title>DiSCo: Making Absence Visible in Intelligent Summarization Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent interfaces increasingly use large language models to summarize user-generated content, yet these summaries emphasize what is mentioned while overlooking what is missing. This presence bias can mislead users who rely on summaries to make decisions. We present Domain Informed Summarization through Contrast (DiSCo), an expectation-based computational approach that makes absences visible by comparing each entity's content with domain topical expectations captured in reference distributions of aspects typically discussed in comparable accommodations. This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces.</description>

      <title>Making Absence Visible: The Roles of Reference and Prompting in Recognizing Missing Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive systems that explain data, or support decision making often emphasize what is present while overlooking what is expected but missing. This presence bias limits users' ability to form complete mental models of a dataset or situation. Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Shot: Multi-step Tool Retrieval via Query Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests. These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.</description>

      <title>MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Online Dynamic Assortment with Dual Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As e-commerce expands, delivering real-time personalized recommendations from vast catalogs poses a critical challenge for retail platforms. Maximizing revenue requires careful consideration of both individual customer characteristics and available item features to continuously optimize assortments over time. In this paper, we consider the dynamic assortment problem with dual contexts -- user and item features. In high-dimensional scenarios, the quadratic growth of dimensions complicates computation and estimation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new low-rank dynamic assortment model to transform this problem into a manageable scale. Then we propose an efficient algorithm that estimates the intrinsic subspaces and utilizes the upper confidence bound approach to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in online decision making. Theoretically, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((d_1+d_2)r\sqrt{T})$, where $d_1, d_2$ represent the dimensions of the user and item features respectively, $r$ is the rank of the parameter matrix, and $T$ denotes the time horizon. This bound represents a substantial improvement over prior literature, achieved by leveraging the low-rank structure. Extensive simulations and an application to the Expedia hotel recommendation dataset further demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</description>

      <title>TRUE: A Reproducible Framework for LLM-Driven Relevance Judgment in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However, existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent, coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>CREAM: Continual Retrieval on Dynamic Streaming Corpora with Adaptive Soft Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) in dynamic data streams is a crucial task, as shifts in data distribution degrade the performance of AI-powered IR systems. To mitigate this issue, memory-based continual learning has been widely adopted for IR. However, existing methods rely on a fixed set of queries with ground-truth documents, which limits generalization to unseen data, making them impractical for real-world applications. To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval. CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting. We realize this through three key techniques: fine-grained similarity estimation, regularized cluster prototyping, and stratified coreset sampling. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CREAM exhibits superior adaptability and retrieval accuracy, outperforming the strongest method in a label-free setting by 27.79% in Success@5 and 44.5% in Recall@10 on average, and achieving performance comparable to or even exceeding that of supervised methods.</description>

      <title>TagRAG: Tag-guided Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving external knowledge to support informed and grounded responses. However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average winning rate of 78.36% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.</description>

      <title>Studying Illustrations in Manuscripts: An Efficient Deep-Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution has opened transformative possibilities for the humanities, particularly in unlocking the visual-artistic content embedded in historical illuminated manuscripts. While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically locate, extract, and analyze illustrations at scale remains a major challenge. We present a general and scalable AI-based pipeline for large-scale visual analysis of illuminated manuscripts. The framework integrates modern deep-learning models for page-level illustration detection, illustration extraction, and multimodal description, enabling scholars to search, cluster, and study visual materials and artistic trends across entire corpora. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on large heterogeneous collections, including the Vatican Library and richly illuminated manuscripts such as the Bible of Borso d'Este. The system reveals meaningful visual patterns and cross-manuscript relationships by embedding illustrations into a shared representation space and analyzing their similarity structure (see figure 4). By harnessing recent advances in computer vision and vision-language models, our framework enables new forms of large-scale visual scholarship in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage making it possible to explore iconography, stylistic trends, and cultural connections in ways that were previously impractical.</description>

      <title>SemCSE-Multi: Multifaceted and Decodable Embeddings for Aspect-Specific and Interpretable Scientific Domain Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space. We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability in user-centric settings.</description>

Abstract: Embedding-based dense retrieval has become the cornerstone of many critical applications, where approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) queries are often combined with filters on labels such as dates and price ranges. Graph-based indexes achieve state-of-the-art performance on unfiltered ANNS but encounter connectivity breakdown on low-selectivity filtered queries, where qualifying vectors become sparse and the graph structure among them fragments. Recent research proposes specialized graph indexes that address this issue by expanding graph degree, which incurs prohibitively high construction costs. Given these inherent limitations of graph-based methods, we argue for a dual-index architecture and present Curator, a partition-based index that complements existing graph-based approaches for low-selectivity filtered ANNS. Curator builds specialized indexes for different labels within a shared clustering tree, where each index adapts to the distribution of its qualifying vectors to ensure efficient search while sharing structure to minimize memory overhead. The system also supports incremental updates and handles arbitrary complex predicates beyond single-label filters by efficiently constructing temporary indexes on the fly. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating Curator with state-of-the-art graph indexes reduces low-selectivity query latency by up to 20.9x compared to pre-filtering fallback, while increasing construction time and memory footprint by only 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively.</description>
