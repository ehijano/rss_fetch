      <title>Copula-based analytical results of horizontal visibility graphs for correlated time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visibility graph (VG) algorithm and its variants have been extensively studied in the time series analysis as they transform the time series into the network of nodes and links, enabling to characterize the time series in terms of network measures such as degree distributions. Despite numerous practical applications of VGs in various disciplines, analytical, rigorous understanding of VGs for the correlated time series is still far from complete due to the lack of mathematical tools for modeling the correlation structure in the time series in a tractable form. In this work, we adopt the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula method to derive the analytical solutions of degree distributions of the horizontal visibility graph (HVG) and its directed version (DHVG) for the correlated time series. Our analytical results show exactly how the correlation between consecutive data points affects the degree distributions of HVGs and DHVGs up to the first order of the correlation parameter in the FGM copula. Thus, our findings shed light on the rigorous understanding of the VG algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Emissivity Retrieval from Hyperspectral Data via Physics-Guided Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08291v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given remotely-sensed radiance measurement.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of machine learning and statistical methods for automatic identification and quantification in {\gamma}-ray spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in {\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1) spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation; and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance, the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification. Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver less satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning optimizes predictions of missing links in real-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation of methods to analyze motion changes in single-particle experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments can reveal valuable information about the heterogeneity of transport processes and interactions between cell components. These characteristics are seen as motion changes in the particle trajectories. Despite the existence of multiple approaches to carry out this type of analysis, no objective assessment of these methods has been performed so far. Here, we report the results of a competition to characterize and rank the performance of these methods when analyzing the dynamic behavior of single molecules. To run this competition, we implemented a software library that simulates realistic data corresponding to widespread diffusion and interaction models, both in the form of trajectories and videos obtained in typical experimental conditions. The competition constitutes the first assessment of these methods, providing insights into the current limitations of the field, fostering the development of new approaches, and guiding researchers to identify optimal tools for analyzing their experiments.</description>

      <title>Closer look at sum uncertainty relations and related relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>
