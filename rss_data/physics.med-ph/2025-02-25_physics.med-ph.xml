      <title>A mixed integer programming approach to minibeam aperture optimization for multi-collimator proton minibeam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Multi-collimator proton minibeam radiation therapy (MC-pMBRT) has recently emerged as a versatile technique for dose shaping, enabling peak-valley dose patterns in organs-at-risk (OAR) while maintaining a uniform dose distribution in tumor. MC-pMBRT leverages a set of generic multi-slit collimators (MSC) with varying center-to-center distances. However, the current method for minibeam aperture optimization (MAO), i.e., the selection of MSC per beam angle, is manual and heuristic, resulting in computational inefficiencies and no guarantee of optimality. This work introduces a novel mixed integer programming (MIP) approach to MAO for optimizing MC-pMBRT plan quality. Methods: The proposed MIP approach jointly optimizes dose distributions, peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and selects the optimal set of MSC per beam angle. The optimization problem includes decision variables for MSC selection per beam angle and spot weights. The proposed MIP approach is a two-step process: Step1: the binary variables are optimally determined to select MSC for each beam angle; Step 2: the continuous variables are solved to determine the spot weights. Both steps utilize iterative convex relaxation and the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the problems. Results: The proposed MIP method for MAO (MIP-MAO) was validated against the conventional heuristic method (CONV) for MC-pMBRT treatment planning. Results indicate that MIP-MAO enhances the conformity index (CI) for the target and improves PVDR for OAR. For instance, in a head-and-neck case, CI improved from 0.61 (CONV) to 0.70 (MIP-MAO); in an abdomen case, CI improved from 0.78 (CONV) to 0.83 (MIP-MAO). Additionally, MIP-MAO reduced mean doses in the body and OAR. Conclusions: A novel MIP approach for MAO in MC-pMBRT is presented, showing demonstrated improvements in plan quality and PVDR compared to the heuristic method.</description>

      <title>Minibeam-pLATTICE: A novel proton LATTICE modality using minibeams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: LATTICE, a form of spatially fractionated radiation therapy that delivers high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys within the target, has been clinically utilized for treating bulky tumors. However, its application to small-to-medium-sized target remains challenging due to beam size limitations. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel proton LATTICE (pLATTICE) modality using minibeams, namely minibeam-pLATTICE, that extends LATTICE approach for small-to-medium targets. Methods: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are introduced. (1) M0: a fixed minibeam orientation for all beam angles; (2) M1: alternated minibeam orientations, for consecutive beam angles; (3) M2: multiple minibeam orientations for each beam angle. For each minibeam-pLATTICE method, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize dose uniformity in target peaks and valleys, as well as dose-volume-histogram-based objectives. This problem is solved using iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are validated to demonstrate the feasibility of minibeam-pLATTICE for head-and-neck cases. The advantages of this modality over conventional beam (CONV) pLATTICE are evaluated by comparing peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) and dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR). All three minibeam-pLATTICE modalities achieved improved plan quality compared to CONV, with M2 yielding the best results. For example, in terms of PVDR, M2=5.89, compared to CONV=4.13, M0=4.87 and M1=4.7. Conclusion: A novel minibeam-pLATTICE modality is proposed that generates lattice dose patterns for small-to-medium targets, which are not achievable with conventional pLATTICE due to beam size limitations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing normal tissue sparing via spatiotemporal optimization under equivalent tumor-radical efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Spatiotemporal optimization in radiation therapy involves determining the optimal number of dose delivery fractions (temporal) and the optimal dose per fraction (spatial). Traditional approaches focus on maximizing the biologically effective dose (BED) to the target while constraining BED to organs-at-risk (OAR), which may lead to insufficient BED for complete tumor cell kill. This work proposes a formulation that ensures adequate BED delivery to the target while minimizing BED to the OAR. Approach: A spatiotemporal optimization model is developed that incorporates an inequality constraint to guarantee sufficient BED for tumor cell kill while minimizing BED to the OAR. The model accounts for tumor proliferation dynamics, including lag time (delay before proliferation begins) and doubling time (time for tumor volume to double), to optimize dose fractionation. Results: The performance of our formulation is evaluated for varying lag and doubling times. The results show that mean BED to the target consistently meets the minimum requirement for tumor cell kill. Additionally, the mean BED to OAR varies based on tumor proliferation dynamics. In the prostate case with lag time of 7 days and doubling time of 2 days, it is observed that mean BED delivered to femoral head is lowest at around 20 fractions, making this an optimal choice. While in the head-and-neck case, mean BED to OAR decreases as the number of fractions increases, suggesting that a higher number of fractions is optimal. Significance: A spatiotemporal optimization model is presented that minimizes BED to the OAR while ensuring sufficient BED for tumor cell kill. By incorporating tumor lag and doubling time, the approach identifies optimal number of fractions. This model can be extended to support hyperfractionation or accelerated fractionation strategies, offering a versatile tool for clinical treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy in self-supervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) estimates tissue properties of interest from measured MRI signals. This process is conventionally achieved by computationally expensive model fitting, which limits qMRI's clinical use, motivating recent development based on machine learning. Self-supervised approaches are particularly popular as they avoid the pitfall of distributional shift that affects supervised methods. However, it is unknown how they would behave if similar signals can result from multiple tissue properties, a common challenge known as model degeneracy. Understanding this is crucial for ascertaining the scope within which self-supervised approaches may be applied. To this end, this work makes two contributions. First, we demonstrate that model degeneracy will compromise self-supervised approaches, motivating the development of mitigating strategies. Second, we propose such a mitigating solution based on applying appropriate constraining transforms on the output of the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder network typically employed in self-supervised approaches. We illustrate both contributions using the estimation of proton density fat fraction and $R_2^*$ from chemical shift-encoded MRI, an ideal exemplar due to its exhibition of degeneracy across the full parameter space. The results from both simulation and $\textit{in vivo}$ experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy resolves model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Fast Whole-Brain CEST Imaging at 3T with True FISP Readout: Towards Homogeneous, Unbiased, Multi-Parameter and Clinical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aimed to develop a reliable whole-brain multi-parameter CEST imaging sequence at 3T. By overcoming the limitations of existing imaging techniques, such as low SNR, image distortion, and magnetic susceptibility artifacts, this research intended to facilitate clinical research on brain diseases. Methods: A whole-brain single-shot CEST sequence with True FISP readout,also called bSSFP was designed. The sequence included a pre-saturation module followed by a fast True FISP readout. The four-angle method was used to acquire B0, rB1, and T1 maps for CEST data correction. MRI experiments were carried out on five healthy volunteers using a 3T whole-body MRI system. Data processing involved motion correction, deep-learning denoising, B0 correction, neural network B1 correction, and four-pool Lorentz fitting. One participant underwent three scans over three days to calculate the coefficient of variation of CEST metrics in different brain regions and nuclei. Results: The CEST contrast of MTRLD and AREX with B1 correction, incorporating APT, NOE, and MT effects, was obtained within 9 minutes. Neural network B1 correction not only reduced the relative error of CEST images but also eliminated the inhomogeneous spatial distribution related to the B1 field. The coefficient of variation of CEST metrics in most brain regions was below 10%. Notably, no banding artifacts or magnetic susceptibility artifacts were observed, and the SAR value was within an acceptable range. Conclusion: Homogeneous, unbiased, multi-parameter whole-brain CEST imaging can be achieved within 9 minutes at 3T using a single-shot True FISP readout. This sequence enables rapid acquisition of high-SNR CEST images free from banding artifacts and magnetic susceptibility artifacts, making it suitable for clinical multi-parameter CEST imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi Crystal based Circular Patch Antenna with Artificial Magnetic Conductor for Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design and simulation of Quasi Crystal based Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) Circular Microstrip Patch Antenna for tumor detection is discussed. Initially, a Circular Microstrip patch antenna is designed with a resonant frequency of $2.45 \, \text{GHz}$. The performance of the designed antenna can be improved by incorporating AMC in order to avoid surface waves. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for detecting malignant tissues in a more focusing manner using a Penrose patterned Quasi crystal. Quasi crystals act as a focusing device as it can transmit electromagnetic waves in a narrow direction. The tumor of size $3 \, \text{mm}$ is placed at a particular location specifically at $(0,0,10)$ in the breast phantom model. Our aim is the proposed model could identify the exact tumor location or the nearest co-ordinates of the actual location. Scattering parameters $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ obtained at $-10.30 \, \text{dB}$ and $-9.15 \, \text{dB}$ respectively at the tumor location $(0,-4,30)$ without the presence of Quasi crystal. Results were compared in each stage with and without Penrose Quasi crystal based patch antenna. The Quasi crystal based model was simulated and the results $S_{11}$ and $S_{22}$ parameters got improved at $-10.02 \, \text{dB}$ and $-9.37 \, \text{dB}$ respectively at the tumor location $(-1, -1, 13)$. The total specific absorption rate (SAR) of the proposed model is $0.139 \, \text{W/kg}$. Hence the proposed model is highly bio-compatible and safely applicable for human body.</description>

      <title>Motion-Robust T2* Quantification from Gradient Echo MRI with Physics-Informed Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: T2* quantification from gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging is particularly affected by subject motion due to the high sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are influenced by motion and might cause signal loss. Thus, motion correction is crucial to obtain high-quality T2* maps.
  Methods: We extend our previously introduced learning-based physics-informed motion correction method, PHIMO, by utilizing acquisition knowledge to enhance the reconstruction performance for challenging motion patterns and increase PHIMO's robustness to varying strengths of magnetic field inhomogeneities across the brain. We perform comprehensive evaluations regarding motion detection accuracy and image quality for data with simulated and real motion.
  Results: Our extended version of PHIMO outperforms the learning-based baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to line detection and image quality. Moreover, PHIMO performs on-par with a conventional state-of-the-art motion correction method for T2* quantification from gradient echo MRI, which relies on redundant data acquisition.
  Conclusion: PHIMO's competitive motion correction performance, combined with a reduction in acquisition time by over 40% compared to the state-of-the-art method, make it a promising solution for motion-robust T2* quantification in research settings and clinical routine.</description>

      <title>Accelerated X-Ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography via Multi-Pencil-Beam Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT), a form of X-ray molecular imaging, offers detailed quantitative imaging capabilities for high-Z metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which are widely studied for their applications in multifunctional theranostics. Due to its affordability and accessibility, the benchtop XFCT prototype typically employs a single-pixel detector (SPD) with single-pencil-beam (SPB) X-ray excitation. While this design (resembling the first-generation CT geometry) achieves reliable detection sensitivity, it is hindered by long imaging times. The use of simultaneous multiple-pencil-beam (MPB) excitation presents a promising solution to significantly reduce imaging times. In this study, we developed a repeatable workflow that combines Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and 3D printing to design Nbeam-MPB collimator, where Nbeam is the number of beams generated by the collimator. As an initial test, we fabricated a 2-MPB collimator and evaluated the performance of 2-MPB-based XFCT imaging on a physical phantom and small animals surgically implanted with agarose pellets containing gold chloride (H[AuCl4]). The results demonstrated a 2x acceleration in image acquisition without compromising the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). We further investigated the concept of Nbeam-MPB acceleration on the MC computational XFCT system, which confirmed the feasibility of achieving at least 4x acceleration with 4-MPB excitation. Combined with additional system optimization, such as X-ray beam flux optimization, XFCT imaging could be further accelerated, reducing acquisition time from hours to minutes and meeting the requirements for routine MNP imaging.</description>
