      <title>Reconstructing Superoscillations Buried Deeply in Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05399v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize a method using frequency combs to construct waves that feature superoscillations - local regions of the wave that exhibit a change in phase that the bandlimits of the wave should not otherwise allow. This method has been shown to create superoscillating regions that mimic any analytic function - even ones well outside the bandlimits - to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that these waves are extremely robust against noise, allowing for accurate reconstruction of a superoscillating target function thoroughly buried in noise. We additionally show that such a construction can be easily used to range-resolve a signal well below the commonly accepted fundamental limit.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Learned Neural Phase Functions for Basis-Free Point Spread Function Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that significantly outperforms existing pixel-wise optimization methods in phase function quality.</description>

      <title>Dilated space-and-wavelength selective crosspoint optical switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated switches that are both space and wavelength selective are a highly promising technology for data-intensive applications as they benefit from multi-dimensional manipulation of optical signals. However, scaling these switches normally poses stringent challenges such as increased fabrication complexity and control difficulties, due to the growing number of switching elements. In this work, we propose a novel dilated crosspoint topology, which efficiently handles both space and wavelength selective switching, while reducing the required switching element count by an order of magnitude compared to reported designs. To the best of our knowledge, our design requires the fewest switching elements for an equivalent routing paths number and it fully cancels the first-order in-band crosstalk. We demonstrate such an ultra-compact space-and-wavelength-selective switch (SWSS) at a scale of 4{\times}4{\times}4{\lambda} on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Experimental results reveal that the switch achieves an insertion loss ranging from 2.3 dB to 8.6 dB and crosstalk levels in between -35.3 dB and -59.7 dB. The add-drop microring-resonators (MRRs) are equipped with micro-heaters, exhibiting a rise and fall time of 46 {\mu}s and 0.33 {\mu}s, respectively. These performance characteristics highlight the switch's ultra-low element count and crosstalk with low insertion loss, making it a promising candidate for advanced data center applications.</description>

      <title>Single picture single photon single pixel 3D imaging through unknown thick scattering medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging through thick scattering media presents significant challenges, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) applications. This manuscript demonstrates a novel scheme for single-image-enabled 3D imaging through such media, treating the scattering medium as a lens. This approach captures a comprehensive image containing information about objects hidden at various depths. By leveraging depth from focus and the reduced thickness of the scattering medium for single-pixel imaging, the proposed method ensures robust 3D imaging capabilities. We develop both traditional metric-based and deep learning-based methods to extract depth information for each pixel, allowing us to explore the locations of both positive and negative objects, whether shallow or deep. Remarkably, this scheme enables the simultaneous 3D reconstruction of targets concealed within the scattering medium. Specifically, we successfully reconstructed targets buried at depths of 5 mm and 30 mm within a total medium thickness of 60 mm. Additionally, we can effectively distinguish targets at three different depths. Notably, this scheme requires no prior knowledge of the scattering medium, no invasive procedures, reference measurements, or calibration.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-multiplexed photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using multiport photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of application-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth. A 4 $\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used to perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the performance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%. This work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a foundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rydberg excitons in monolayer MoS2 at room temperature by Imbert-Fedorov shift spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for investigating the properties of open quantum systems, thanks to their large binding energies(hundreds of meV). However, the study of Rydberg excitons in TMDs has been hindered by sample quality limitations, strong background signals from ground excitons, and broadening at room temperature. In this work, we report the first observation of multiple Rydberg exciton states in monolayer MoS2 at room temperature using Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift spectroscopy. By numerically solving the Schrodinger equation, we extracted the quasiparticle band gaps for A and B excitons, confirming the temperature-induced redshift of the band gap, in excellent agreement with previous results. Our findings establish IF shift spectroscopy as a powerful tool for characterizing Rydberg excitons in TMDs, paving the way for potential applications in quantum manipulation and control.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Topological Dissipative Light Bullets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a novel class of dissipative light bullets whose spatial profiles may be drastically reshaped along the bulk, edges and corners of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice owing to the dissipative and topological nature of the system. These light bullets appear due to resonances with different modes in lattice spectrum and may have very rich shapes that can be adiabatically controlled by varying the frequency of the external laser source. We report on robust stationary bullets and breathers which are understood from the corresponding bifurcation analysis. Our results provide a new route to realisation of reconfigurable and robust 3D light forms in topologically nontrivial systems.</description>

      <title>The robustness of skyrmion numbers of structured optical fields in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of vector optical fields has brought forth numerous applications. Among these optical fields, a particular class of vector vortex beams has emerged, leading to the emergence of intriguing optical skyrmion fields characterized by skyrmion numbers. The optical skyrmion fields are well-defined by their effective magnetization and possess topologically protected configurations. It is anticipated that this type of optical structure can be exploited for encoding information in optical communication, even under perturbations such as turbulent air, optical fibers, and even general random media. In this study, we numerically demonstrate that the skyrmion numbers of optical skyrmion fields exhibit a certain degree of robustness to atmospheric turbulence, even though their intensity, phase and polarization patterns are distorted. Intriguingly, it is also observed that a larger difference between the absolute values of two azimuthal indices of the vectorial structured light field can lead to a superior level of resilience. These properties not only enhance the versatility of skyrmion fields and their numbers, but also open up new possibilities for their use in various applications across noisy channels.</description>

      <title>Formation and Controlling of Optical Hopfions in High Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal vortex is a kind of novel and exotic structured light with potential applications in photonic topology and quantum information. Here, we present the study on high harmonic generation (HHG) from the interaction of the intense toroidal vortices with atoms. We show that the spatial distribution of harmonic spectra reveal unique structures, which are kinds of high-order topological toroidal vortex because of the rotating of the driving fields with transverse orbital angular momentum. Then we show that, by synthesizing the toroidal vortices and optical vortices with longitudinal orbital angular momentum, it is able to generate the optical hopfions in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, which exhibit completely different topological property compared with both the driving fields. Harnessing the spin angular momentum selection rules, we further show that one can control the topological texture and channel each harmonic into a single mode of controllable Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Observation of polaronic state assisted sub-bandgap saturable absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaronic effects involving stabilization of localized charge character by structural deformations and polarizations have attracted considerable investigations in soft lattice lead halide perovskites. However, the concept of polaron assisted nonlinear photonics remains largely unexplored, which has a wide range of applications from optoelectronics to telecommunications and quantum technologies. Here, we report the first observation of the polaronic state assisted saturable absorption through subbandgap excitation with a redshift exceeding 60 meV. By combining photoluminescence, transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations, we explicate that the anomalous nonlinear saturable absorption is caused by the transient picosecond timescale polaronic state formed by strong carrier exciton phonon coupling effect. The bandgap fluctuation can be further tuned through exciton phonon coupling of perovskites with different Young's modulus. This suggests that we can design targeted soft lattice lead halide perovskite with a specific structure to effectively manipulate exciton phonon coupling and exciton polaron formation. These findings profoundly expand our understanding of exciton polaronic nonlinear optics physics and provide an ideal platform for developing actively tunable nonlinear photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Photonic Crystal Waveguides Using Neural Networks and Dispersion Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) play a critical role in precisely controlling light propagation, enabling high-performance functions in applications such as optical communication and integrated photonics. The design of PCWs traditionally relies on complex numerical methods, including finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and plane-wave expansion (PWE) methods, which are often inefficient when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces, particularly for subwavelength structures. To overcome these challenges, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based inverse design method is introduced to optimize the structural parameters of PCWs. By simulating band structures under varying line defect widths and air hole radii using MIT Photonic Bands (MPB), a large dataset was generated, mapping structural parameters to corresponding band characteristics. Backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) and CNN models were trained on this dataset to predict key PCW structural parameters. The CNN model demonstrated superior performance in predicting complex geometries, maintaining high accuracy even when extrapolating beyond the training dataset, with precision up to four decimal places. In contrast, the BPNN model exhibited faster training times and higher computational efficiency on smaller datasets, though it performed less effectively on larger datasets. Cross-validation using MPB confirmed the generalization capability and reliability of both models. This study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in photonic device design, particularly for advancing the development of high-efficiency, low-loss components in integrated photonics and optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabatic non-Abelian braiding on silicon photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Abelian braiding describes the exchange behavior of anyons, which can be leveraged to encode qubits for quantum computing. Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and impeding practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate a shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of telecommunication light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises tri-layer silicon waveguides stacked and embedded in the SU-8 polymer, employing an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations and give rise to compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Remarkably, this achievement represents the most compact braiding apparatus ever reported, with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal reflection of mid-infrared light by highly doped InAs at low magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental observation of room-temperature nonreciprocal reflection of mid-infrared light from planar highly doped InAs surfaces at low magnetic fields ranging from 0.07 T to 0.16 T. Using ellipsometry, we demonstrate that the amplitude ratio and phase shift of reflected light are nonreciprocal in the Voigt configuration. We also demonstrate using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy that the nonreciprocal reflectance contrast (the difference in reflectance in opposite directions) increases with the magnitude of the magnetic field for p-polarized light. Our work is a step toward the practical implementation of nonreciprocal thermal emitters and absorbers and applications such as remote magnetic field sensing.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, Au dimer-based nanostructures are exhaustively studied due to their outstanding potential as plasmonic nanoantennas for future applications in high-sensitivity molecular sensing by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). In this work, we analyze nano-gapped Au nanowires (NWs) or Au-NWs dimers for designing efficient nanoantennas, reporting an exhaustive study about dimer length and laser polarization orientation effects on their SERS-based molecular sensing performance. Arrays of nanoantennas with gaps about 22 (+/-)4 [nm], nominal square cross-sections of 60 [nm] x 60 [nm], and different lengths from 300 [nm] up to 1200 [nm] were fabricated by Au evaporation and subsequent e-beam lithography. SERS performance was studied by confocal Raman microscopy using a linearly-polarized 633 [nm] laser. A critical impact of the polarization alignment on the spectral resolution of the studied Raman marker imprint was observed. Results show that the Raman signal is maximized by aligning the polarization orientation with the nanowire long axis, it is reduced by increasing the relative angle, and it is abruptly minimized when both are perpendicular. These observations were consistent with numerical simulations carried out by the FDTD method, which predict a similar dependence between the orientation of linearly-polarized light and electric-near field amplification in the nano-gap zone. Our results provide an interesting paradigm and relevant insights in determining the role of laser polarization on the Raman signal enhancement in nano-gapped Au nanowires, showing the key role of this measurement condition on the SERS-based molecular sensing efficiency of this kind of nanostructure.</description>

      <title>Supercontinuum generation in high-index doped silica photonic integrated circuits under diverse pumping settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in supercontinuum light generation have been remarkable, particularly in the context of highly nonlinear photonic integrated waveguides. In this study, we thoroughly investigate supercontinuum (SC) generation in high-index doped silica glass integrated waveguides, exploring various femtosecond pumping wavelengths and input polarization states. We demonstrate broadband SC generation spanning from 700 nm to 2400 nm when pumping within the anomalous dispersion regime at 1200 nm, 1300 nm, and 1550 nm. In contrast, pumping within the normal dispersion regime at 1000 nm results in narrower SC spectra, primarily due to coherent nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation and optical wave breaking. Additionally, we examine the impact of TE/TM polarization modes on SC generation, shedding light on the polarization-dependent characteristics of the broadening process. Moreover, Raman scattering measurements reveal the emergence of two new peaks at 48.8 THz and 75.1 THz in the Raman gain curve. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations based on a generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation that incorporates the new Raman gain contribution. Finally, relative intensity noise measurements conducted using the dispersive Fourier transform technique indicate excellent stability of the generated SC spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate wavelet-like localized solutions in nonlinear waveguides, enabled by complementary propagation constants embedded in domains of anomalous dispersion. They are carrier-envelope-phase stable and independent of fine details of the dispersion profile. Their spectra extend over vast ranges and they are also robust against nonlinear perturbations, providing properties highly demanded in ultrafast science. In the limits of low and high energies, approximate representations are given by modified Morlet wavelets and Gaussian pulses, respectively. We demonstrate their special features by exploiting general principles of quantum scattering theory and solid-state physics, realizing interlocked chains of wavelets analog to photonic time crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and wave properties of pseudosphere-shape microlasers are investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. These pseudosphere microlasers are surface-like organic microlasers with constant negative curvature, which were fabricated with high optical quality by direct laser writing. It is shown that they behave, in many ways, similar to two-dimensional flat disks, regardless of the different Gaussian curvature of the two systems. Indeed, it is evidenced that, due to rotational symmetry, the pseudosphere is an integrable system with marginally stable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large-scale self-assembled nanophotonic scintillators for X-ray imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators are essential for converting X-ray energy into visible light in imaging technologies. Their widespread application in imaging technologies has been enabled by scalable, high-quality, and affordable manufacturing methods. Nanophotonic scintillators, which feature nanostructures at the scale of their emission wavelength, provide a promising approach to enhance emission properties like light yield, decay time, and directionality. However, scalable fabrication of such nanostructured scintillators has been a significant challenge, impeding their widespread adoption. Here, we present a scalable fabrication method for large-area nanophotonic scintillators based on the self-assembly of chalcogenide glass photonic crystals. This technique enables the production of nanophotonic scintillators over wafer-scale areas, achieving a six-fold enhancement in light yield compared to unpatterned scintillators. We demonstrate this approach using a conventional X-ray scintillator material, cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce). By analyzing the influence of surface nanofabrication disorder, we establish its effect on imaging performance and provide a route towards large-scale scintillation enhancements without decrease in spatial resolution. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our nanophotonic scintillators through X-ray imaging of biological and inorganic specimens. Our results indicate that this scalable fabrication technique could enable the industrial implementation of a new generation of nanophotonic-enhanced scintillators, with significant implications for advancements in medical imaging, security screening, and nondestructive testing.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal photonic quantum gates over 7.0 km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15634v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks provide a prospective paradigm to connect separated quantum nodes, which relies on the distribution of long-distance entanglement and active feedforward control of qubits between remote nodes. Such approaches can be utilized to construct nonlocal quantum gates, forming building blocks for distributed quantum computing and other novel quantum applications. However, these gates have only been realized within single nodes or between nodes separated by a few tens of meters, limiting the ability to harness computing resources in large-scale quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal photonic quantum gates between two nodes spatially separated by 7.0 km using stationary qubits based on multiplexed quantum memories, flying qubits at telecom wavelengths, and active feedforward control based on field-deployed fibers. Furthermore, we illustrate quantum parallelism by implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum phase estimation algorithm between the two remote nodes. These results represent a proof-of-principle demonstration of quantum gates over metropolitan-scale distances and lay the foundation for the construction of large-scale distributed quantum networks relying on existing fiber channels.</description>

Abstract: Optical accordion lattices are routinely used in quantum simulation and quantum computation experiments to tune optical lattice spacings. Here, we present a technique for creating tunable optical lattices using binary-phase transmission gratings. Lattices generated using this technique have high uniformity, contrast, lattice spacing tunability, and power efficiencies. These attributes are crucial for exploring collective quantum phenomena in highly ordered atomic arrays coupled to optical waveguides for quantum networking and quantum simulation. In this paper, we demonstrate adjustable-period lattices that are ideally suited for use with optical nanofibers.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma rays consist of high-energy photons that selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense or compressed object interior. Yet, the available gamma sources lack power and brightness which, if available, would revolutionize science and technology. The predicted laser-driven Gamma Flash (GF) would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. It is based on inverse Compton scattering in a laser-solid interaction at irradiance typically above $10^{23}W/cm^2$. GF is one of the motivating goals for the most advanced laser facilities. However, till now GF remains overshadowed by simultaneously generated low-brightness Bremsstrahlung. Here we experimentally differentiate these two mechanisms and demonstrate a GF dominant regime producing several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. We found steep GF yield growth with the laser power and irradiance. Simulations revealed a Terawatt GF with nanometre source and an attosecond pulse train with a record brightness of $~10^{22}photons/mm^2mrad^2s0.1\%BW$ at up to tens of MeV. The small source size and high brightness paves the way towards spatially coherent gamma rays. At high photon energies, our regime is comparable in brightness to astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. We anticipate that the gamma ray source based on our findings will facilitate a breakthrough in research on future inertial fusion energy by enabling high-spatial-resolution time-resolved radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely compressed targets. Such a new compact bright ultrafast gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, and nuclear waste management and non-proliferation.</description>

Abstract: In experiments requiring extreme darkness, such as experiments probing the limits of human vision, assessment of the background photon flux is essential. However, direct measurement thereof with standard single photon detectors is challenged by dark counts and their fluctuations. Here we report an experiment and detailed statistical analysis of a direct measurement of darkness in a dedicated dark chamber suitable for human vision experiments, only using a standard single photon detector and a mechanical shutter. From a Bayesian analysis of $616$ h of data, we find substantial to decisive evidence for absolute darkness (depending on choice of prior distribution) based on the Savage-Dickey ratio, and a light level $&lt;0.039$ cnt/s (posterior $0.95$-highest density interval).</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Combs with Path Identity for Quantum Remote Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing promises to revolutionize sensing applications by employing quantum states of light or matter as sensing probes. Photons are the clear choice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and interact with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the quantum illumination framework, which requires a quantum memory to store a single photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a target and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations are limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces various roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and noise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances. We propose a novel quantum sensing framework that addresses these challenges using quantum frequency combs with path identity for remote sensing of signatures (``qCOMBPASS"). The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum resources, namely quantum induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency combs, and two-mode squeezed light, allows for quantum remote sensing without requiring a quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar based on entangled frequency comb pairs that uses path identity to detect/range/sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb in the pair that never flew to target, but that contains target information ``teleported" by quantum-induced coherence from the other comb in the pair that did fly to target but is not detected.</description>

      <title>Towards simultaneous imaging of ultrafast nuclear and electronic dynamics in small molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07088v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a chemical bond is broken, the molecular structure undergoes a transformation. An ideal experiment should probe the change in the electronic and nuclear structure simultaneously. Here, we present a method for the simultaneous time-resolved imaging of nuclear and electron dynamics by combining Coulomb explosion imaging with strong-field photoelectron momentum imaging. The simplest chemical reaction, H$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$^+ +$ H, is probed experimentally for the delay-dependent kinetic energy release, and numerically for the transient change in the photoelectron spectra during the dissociation process. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the fixed-nuclei approximation numerically and the results are compared to those from a simple imaging model. The numerical results reflect the evolution in the electron density in the molecular ion as its bond is first stretched and then brakes apart. Our work shows how simple gas-phase chemical dynamics can be captured in complete molecular movies.</description>

Abstract: Photonics offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing by enabling low-latency, high-speed, and energy-efficient computations. However, conventional photonic tensor cores face significant challenges in constructing large-scale photonic neuromorphic networks. Here, we propose a fully integrated photonic tensor core, consisting of only two thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a III-V laser, and a charge-integration photoreceiver. Despite its simple architecture, it is capable of implementing an entire layer of a neural network with a computational speed of 120 GOPS, while also allowing flexible adjustment of the number of inputs (fan-in) and outputs (fan-out). Our tensor core supports rapid in-situ training with a weight update speed of 60 GHz. Furthermore, it successfully classifies (supervised learning) and clusters (unsupervised learning) 112 * 112-pixel images through in-situ training. To enable in-situ training for clustering AI tasks, we offer a solution for performing multiplications between two negative numbers.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>The shadow of a laser beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light, being massless, casts no shadow; under ordinary circumstances, photons pass right through each other unimpeded. Here, we demonstrate a laser beam acting like an object - the beam casts a shadow upon a surface when the beam is illuminated by another light source. We observe a regular shadow in the sense it can be seen by the naked eye, it follows the contours of the surface it falls on, and it follows the position and shape of the object (the laser beam). Specifically, we use a nonlinear optical process involving four atomic levels of ruby. We are able to control the intensity of a transmitted laser beam by applying another perpendicular laser beam. We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the object laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately of approximately 22 percent, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day. We provide a theoretical model that predicts the contrast of the shadow. This work opens new possibilities for fabrication, imaging, and illumination.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method that is accurate down to a single-photon level and provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a short rigid piece of few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of biological specimens and the liquid crystal polymer sample (birefringent USAF test). Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient excitation transfer in an LH2-inspired nanoscale stacked ring geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 $nm$, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Effects of Chromatic Dispersion on Single-Photon Temporal Wave Functions in Quantum Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of chromatic dispersion on single-photon temporal wave functions (TWFs) in the context of quantum communications. Departing from classical beam analysis, we focus on the temporal shape of single photons, specifically exploring generalized Gaussian modes. From this foundation, we introduce chirped and unchirped Gaussian TWFs, demonstrating the impact of the chirp parameter in mitigating chromatic dispersion effects. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to time-bin qubits, a topic of ongoing research relevance. By exploring the interplay of dispersion effects on qubit interference patterns, we contribute essential insights to quantum information processing. This comprehensive analysis considers various parameters, introducing a level of complexity not previously explored in the context of dispersion management. We demonstrate the relationships between different quantities and their impact on the spreading of TWFs. Our results not only deepen the theoretical understanding of single-photon TWFs but also offer practical guidelines for system designers to optimize symbol rates in quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Frequency Response Determined by Saddle Points in Non-Hermitian Crystal Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian crystal systems under open boundary condition (OBC), it is generally believed that the OBC modes with frequencies containing positive imaginary parts, when excited by external driving, will experience exponential growth in population, thereby leading to instability. However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Photonic Reservoir Computing: Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Parallel Computing with a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</description>
