      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that conventional saturable periodic structures, in sharp contrast to the conventional systems with different nonlinearities which exhibit the typical S- shaped optical bi- and multi-stable states, reveal some unusual and unique nonlinear dynamics. These include the onset of ramp-like optical bistability (OB) and optical multistability (OM) curves which further transit into mixed OM states combining both ramp-like states followed by the S-shaped multistable curves. We also extend this study to another domain of physics, namely parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)- symmetry, by including equal amount of gain and loss into the system which then establishes additional degree of freedom by enabling the investigation into additional two domains which are the unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetric regimes. Although these bi- and multi-stable states are unusual and unique, when the frequency detuning is introduced, the revival of S-shaped stable states is possible but only in the presence of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry. Conversely, the broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry which usually generates ramp-like multistable states, gives rise to the birth of novel multistable states with a vortex like envelope, (the curve that features simultaneous increase in the critical switch-up and switch-down powers with an increase in the input power) causing a novel structure which has not been reported in the existing literature of different physical systems manifesting multi-stable states.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Beam Profiles from Silicon Photonics Gratings using Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</description>

      <title>Relation between interface symmetry and propagation robustness along domain walls based on valley topological photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley photonic crystals provide efficient designs for the routing of light through channels in extremely compact geometries. The topological origin of the robust transport and the specific geometries under which it can take place have been questioned in recent works. In this article, we introduce a design for valley photonic crystals with richer arrangement possibilities than the standard valley photonic crystals based on two holes of different sizes in the unit cell. Our approach is based on the permutation of three sets of rhombi in an hexagonal lattice to investigate the interplay between Berry curvature, valley Chern number and chirality of interfaces to achieve robust edge-modes propagation along domain walls. We study three types of interfaces with different symmetries: the non-chiral interface with glide-mirror symmetry commonly used in honeycomb-type valley crystals, and two chiral interfaces with or without inversion symmetry of the adjacent bulk lattices. In the latter case, no valley topology is expected. We show that for the three families, edges preserving the shape of the interface through 120{\deg} sharp corners can sustain edge-modes with comparable robustness. Moreover, interfaces with glide-mirror symmetry offer promising performances in circuits with more exotic configurations, like 60{\deg} and 90{\deg} corners or arbitrary curves in which valley preservation is not guaranteed. Our work raises questions about the topological origin of the robustness of transport in valley photonic crystals, discusses the role of the chirality of the interfaces in the propagation around sharp corners, and provides a lattice scheme with broad design possibilities.</description>

      <title>Comparing Femtosecond Optical Tweezers with Conventional CW Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comparative study between continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed optical tweezers for 250 nm, 500 nm and 1-micron radius polystyrene beads at 5 different laser powers. We have used a Ti:Sapphire (MIRA 900F) laser that can be easily switched from CW to pulsed mode of operation, so there is no change in the experimental conditions in the two cases. We have measured the difference in the trap strength in both cases by fitting the power spectrum curve with Lorentzian. As it turns out, trapping with pulsed tweezers seems to be more effective for the smaller particles and as the particle size is increased both CW and pulsed tweezers appear to be equally effective at lower average laser powers but as the power is increased pulsed tweezers do a better job at stable trapping.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electromagnetic toroidal vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous occurrence of toroidal vortices or vortex rings in fluid-dynamic scenarios in nature has garnered significant attention of scientific frontier, whilst, the electromagnetic counterparts of which were only proposed recently with two distinct manifestations: vector toroidal pulses [Nat. Photon. 16, 523 (2022)] and scalar phase toroidal vortices [Nat. Photon. 16, 519 (2022)]. This dichotomy in the understanding of toroidal vortex phenomena has prompted a reassessment of their fundamental nature. Herein, we theoretically propose a novel form of electromagnetic toroidal vortex solutions, that uniquely integrate both scalar and vector characteristics, challenging the prevailing notion of their mutual exclusivity. We also present the experimental generation of the hybrid toroidal vortex pulses by a compact coaxial horn emitter augmented with a metasurface. This methodology not only demonstrates the feasibility of creating such complex vortex structures but also endows the resulting pulses with unique properties, including the coexistence of transverse orbital angular momentum, electromagnetic vortex streets, and topological skyrmion textures. These attributes introduce new dimensions in topologically complex structured waves, opening avenues for enhanced free-space information transmission, topologically nontrivial light-matter interaction and microscopy techniques.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of phase information from low-dose electron microscopy experiments: are we at the limit yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of imaging low-density objects in an electron microscope without causing beam damage is significant in modern TEM. This is especially challenging for life science imaging, where the sample, rather than the instrument, still determines the resolution limit. Here, we explore whether we have to accept this or can progress further in this area. To do this, we use numerical simulations to see how much information we can obtain from a weak phase object at different electron doses. Starting from a model with four phase values, we compare Zernike phase contrast with measuring diffracted intensity under multiple random phase illuminations to solve the inverse problem. Our simulations have shown that diffraction-based methods perform better than the Zernike method, as we have found and addressed a normalization issue that, in some other studies, led to an overly optimistic representation of the Zernike setup. We further validated this using more realistic 2D objects and found that random phase illuminated diffraction can be up to five times more efficient than an ideal Zernike implementation. These findings suggest that diffraction-based methods could be a promising approach for imaging beam-sensitive materials and that current low-dose imaging methods are not yet at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-agnostic Metasurface Design for Next Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>

      <title>Generation of squeezed vacuum state in the millihertz frequency band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has ushered in a new era of observing the universe. Quantum resource advantages offer significant enhancements to the sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories. While squeezed states for ground-based gravitational wave detection have received marked attention, the generation of squeezed states suitable for mid-to-low-frequency detection has remained unexplored. To address the gap in squeezed state optical fields at ultra-low frequencies, we report on the first direct observation of a squeezed vacuum field until Fourier frequency of 4 millihertz with the quantum noise reduction of up to 8 dB, by the employment of a multiple noise suppression scheme. Our work provides quantum resources for future gravitational wave observatories, facilitating the development of quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in perovskite quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of the strong light-matter coupling regime and exciton-polariton condensates has emerged as a compelling approach to introduce strong interactions and nonlinearities into numerous photonic applications, ranging from low-threshold topological lasers to ultrafast all-optical logic devices. The use of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots with strong three-dimensional confinement as the active material in these microcavities would be highly advantageous due to their versatile structural and compositional tunability and wet-chemical processability, as well as potentially enhanced, confinement-induced polaritonic interactions. Yet, to date, cavity exciton-polariton condensation has neither been achieved with epitaxial nor with colloidal quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature polariton condensation in a thin film of monodisperse, colloidal CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots placed in a tunable optical resonator with a Gaussian-shaped deformation serving as wavelength-scale potential well for the polaritons. The onset of polariton condensation under pulsed optical excitation is manifested in emission by its characteristic superlinear intensity dependence, reduced linewidth, blueshift, and extended temporal coherence. Our results, based on this highly engineerable class of perovskite materials with unique optical properties, pave the way for the development of polaritonic devices for ultrabright coherent light sources and photonic information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical mechanics and geometrical optics are deeply connected with each other. In this work, we generalize the analogy between these two disciplines to relativistic conditions. Using this analogy, we are able to make light follow the orbits of massive or massless particles in gravitational field, by designing a particular optical medium with a prescribed refractive index profile according to spacetime geometry. Furthermore, we build the dictionary that connects optical refractive index and spacetime metric, thus extending F = ma optics to the relativistic limit. The results shed light on the equivalence between the dielectric properties of optical media and the geometric structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>T-matrix representation of optical scattering response: Suggestion for a data format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition matrix, frequently abbreviated as T-matrix, contains the complete information in a linear approximation of how a spatially localized object scatters an incident field. The T-matrix is used to study the scattering response of an isolated object and describes the optical response of complex photonic materials made from ensembles of individual objects. T-matrices of certain common structures, potentially, have been repeatedly calculated all over the world again and again. This is not necessary and constitutes a major challenge for various reasons. First, the resources spent on their computation represent an unsustainable financial and ecological burden. Second, with the onset of machine learning, data is the gold of our era, and it should be freely available to everybody to address novel scientific challenges. Finally, the possibility of reproducing simulations could tremendously improve if the considered T-matrices could be shared. To address these challenges, we found it important to agree on a common data format for T-matrices and to enable their collection from different sources and distribution. This document aims to develop the specifications for storing T-matrices and associated metadata. The specifications should allow maximum freedom to accommodate as many use cases as possible without introducing any ambiguity in the stored data. The common format will assist in setting up a public database of T-matrices.</description>

      <title>Substrate-induced maximum optical chirality of planar dielectric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant dielectric planar structures can interact selectively with light of particular helicity thus providing an attractive platform for chiral flat optics. The absence of mirror-symmetry planes defines geometric chirality, and it remains the main condition for achieving strong circular dichroism. For planar optical structures such as photonic-crystal membranes and metasurfaces, breaking of out-of-plane mirror symmetry is especially challenging, as it requires to fabricate meta-atoms with a tilt, variable height, or vertically shifted positions. Although transparent substrates formally break out-of-plane mirror symmetries, their optical effect is typically subtle being rarely considered for enhancing optical chirality. Here we reveal that low-refractive-index substrates can induce up to maximum optical chirality in otherwise achiral metastructures so that the transparency to waves of one helicity is combined with resonant blocking of waves of the opposite helicity. This effect originates from engineering twisted photonic eigenstates of different parities. Our perturbation analysis developed in terms of the resonant-state expansion reveals how the eigenstate coupling induced by a substrate gives rise to a pair of chiral resonances of opposite handedness. Our general theory is confirmed by the specific examples of light transmission in the normal and oblique directions by a rotation-symmetric photonic-crystal membrane placed on different transparent substrates.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast modulation of guided-mode resonance in a nonlinear silicon nitride grating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are vital for both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear phenomenon, induces anisotropic refractive index changes in materials under high-intensity laser beams. However, its limited magnitude restricts its application in free-space nanophotonics. In this study, we demonstrate a significant enhancement-by many orders of magnitude compared to a bare film-of the optical Kerr effect using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating. We designed, fabricated, and measured the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride crossed grating under short light pulses, observing spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power and over fifty percent modulation of resonance magnitude. This work also explores the potential of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping, opening new avenues for advanced all-optical devices utilizing enhanced Kerr nonlinearities in dielectric gratings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating valley-polarized currents at optical frequencies is the key to petahertz valleytronics, yet it remains intractable. To tackle this challenge, we propose an all-optical scheme using non-resonant bichromatic optical fields, which allow for the control of sub-cycle electron dynamics. The combined effect of the helical and asymmetric waveforms of the optical fields leads to the valley-polarization and displacement of the excited electrons concurrently, thereby inducing the valleypolarized currents, on the sub-optical-cycle timescale. This scheme inherently possesses remarkable resilience to decoherence, making it particularly suitable for materials with short decoherence times. Moreover, the direction of the currents can be precisely controlled by adjusting the relative phase of the bichromatic components. Our scheme offers a promising avenue for generating and modulating valley-polarized currents at the femtosecond timescale, opening the door to the realm of petahertz valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Polarization induced buildup and switching mechanisms for soliton molecules composed of noise like pulse transition states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildup and switching mechanisms of solitons in complex nonlinear systems are fundamentally important dynamical regimes. Using a novel strongly nonlinear optical system,the work reveals a new buildup scenario for soliton molecules , which includes a long-duration stage dominated by the emergence of transient NLPs modes to withstand strong disturbances arising from turbulence and extreme nonlinearity in the optical cavity. Systematic simulations reveal effects of the PC rotation angle and intra-cavity nonlinearity on the periodic phase transitions between the different soliton states, and accurately reproduce the experimentally observed buildup and switching mechanisms. These findings could enhance our fundamental study and points to potential uses in designing information encoding systems.</description>

      <title>Talbot effect-based sensor measuring grating period change in subwavelength range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talbot length, the distance between two consecutive self-image planes along the propagation axis for a periodic diffraction object (grating) illuminated by a plane wave, depends on the period of the object and the wavelength of illumination. This property makes the Talbot effect a straightforward technique for measuring the period of a periodic object (grating) by accurately determining the Talbot length for a given illumination wavelength. However, since the Talbot length scale is proportional to the square of the grating period, traditional Talbot techniques face challenges when dealing with smaller grating periods and minor changes in the grating period. Recently, we demonstrated a Fourier transform technique-based Talbot imaging method that allows for controlled Talbot lengths of a periodic object with a constant period and illumination wavelength. Using this method, we successfully measured periods as small as a few micrometers and detected sub-micrometer changes in the periodic object. Furthermore, by measuring the Talbot length of gratings with varying periods imaged through the combination of a thick lens of short focal length and a thin lens of long focal length and large aperture, we determined the effective focal length of the thick lens in close agreement with the theoretical effective focal length of a thick lens in the presence of spherical aberration. These findings establish the Talbot effect as an effective and simple technique for various sensing applications in optics and photonics through the measurement of any physical parameter influencing the Talbot length of a periodic object.</description>

      <title>Temporal solitons in active optical resonators</title>

Abstract: Solitons, as coherent structures that maintain their shape while traveling at constant velocity, are ubiquitous across various branches of physics, from fluid dynamics to quantum fields. However, it is within the realm of optics where solitons have not only served as a primary testbed for understanding solitary wave phenomena but have also transitioned into applications ranging from telecommunications to metrology. In the optical domain, temporal solitons are localized light pulses, self-reinforcing via a delicate balance between nonlinearity and dispersion. Among the many systems hosting temporal solitons, active optical resonators stand out due to their inherent gain medium, enabling to actively sustain solitons. Unlike conventional modelocked lasers, active resonators offer a richer landscape for soliton dynamics through hybrid driving schemes, such as coupling to passive cavities or under external optical injection, affording them unparalleled control and versatility. We discuss key advantages of these systems, with a particular focus on quantum cascade lasers as a promising soliton technology within the class of active resonators. By exploring diverse architectures from traditional Fabry-Perot cavities to racetrack devices operated under external injection, we present the current state-of-the-art and future directions for soliton-based sources in the realm of semiconductor lasers and hybrid integrated photonic systems.</description>

Abstract: While it is possible to estimate the dark matter density at the Sun distance from the galactic center, this does not give information on actual dark matter density in the Solar system. There can be considerable local enhancement of dark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun, the Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for the formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies the possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter masses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft missions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic and molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to gigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive comagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled quantum holograms with hybrid entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, with their capability to control all possible dimensions of light, have become integral to quantum optical applications, including quantum state generation, operation, and tomography. In this work, we utilize a metasurface to generate polarization-hologram hybrid entanglement between a signal-idler photon pair to construct a quantum hologram. The properties of the quantum hologram can be revealed by collapsing the polarization degree of freedom of the idler photon, inducing interference between two holographic states of the signal photon, as a meaningful and selective erasure of the holographic content. In contrary, interference disappears when the idler photon is detected without observing polarization. This process can be further interpreted as a quantum holographic eraser, where the erasing action is visualized with erased contents in holograms. Our construction of polarization-hologram hybrid entangled state with metasurfaces will be useful for quantum communication with enhanced robustness, anti-counterfeiting applications through the additional quantum degrees of freedom, and as an emerging platform for exploring fundamental quantum concepts for entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear frequency-asymmetric optical response in chiral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report our theoretical results on the emergence of a nonlinear frequency-asymmetric optical response characteristic of chiral crystal systems with neither spatial inversion symmetry nor mirror symmetry. Based on the group theoretical analysis, we show that the chirality-related second-order nonlinear optical response occurs for two different input frequencies when the low-energy model Hamiltonian includes a time-reversal-even pseudoscalar quantity, i.e., the electric toroidal monopole. We demonstrate its emergence by investigating a fundamental microscopic model with the chiral-type antisymmetric spin--orbit interaction on a simple cubic lattice. By analyzing the behavior of nonlinear optical conductivity based on the Kubo formula, we find that the response is largely enhanced when one of the frequencies is set to zero and the other is set to a resonant frequency. We also discuss the relaxation time dependence of the response.</description>

      <title>Optical and Raman spectroscopies of 171Yb3+:Y2SiO5 hyperfine structure for application toward microwave-to-optical transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzed the optical techniques for high resolution, low-noise spectroscopy of a hyperfine structure (HFS) made of ytterbium-isotope 171 ions ($^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$:$\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$). Large energy spacings in $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are advantageous for spin-state preparations of quantum memory and construction of a transducer, thereby promoting the simultaneous stable control of the optical frequencies of lasers over a wide range of 3 GHz. We also built our own 2.7-K cryogenic system for optical, radio-wave-assisted spectroscopy. We attained to high resolution and sensitivity both in pump-probe saturation spectroscopy (PPS) and Raman heterodyne spectroscopy (RHS). Our frequency-stabilized PPS achieved a high-resolution spectrum of the HFS, whereas our setup of RHS enabled the efficient detection of paramagnetic spin resonance efficiently for a wide range of radio frequencies. As the underlying Raman process is an up-converting transduction, we present the optimization of the sensitivity of Raman heterodyne detections by selecting the best crystal orientation and efficient radio-wave coupling in future applications toward photon transducers.</description>

      <title>Excitability and memory in a time-delayed optoelectronic neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an optoelectronic circuit composed of an excitable nanoscale resonant-tunneling diode (RTD) driving a nanolaser diode (LD) coupled via time-delayed feedback. Using a combination of numerical path-continuation methods and time simulations, we demonstrate that this RTD-LD system can serve as an artificial neuron, generating pulses in the form of temporal localized states (TLSs) that can be employed as memory for neuromorphic computing. In particular, our findings reveal that the prototypical delayed FitzHugh-Nagumo model previously employed to model the RTD-LD resembles our more realistic model only in the limit of a slow RTD. We show that the RTD time scale plays a critical role in memory capacity as it governs a shift in pulse interaction from repulsive to attractive, leading to a transition from stable to unstable multi-pulse TLSs. Our theoretical analysis uncovers features and challenges previously unknown for the RTD-LD system, including the multistability of TLSs and attractive interaction forces, stemming from the previously neglected intrinsic dynamics of the laser. These effects are crucial to consider since they define the memory properties of the RTD-LD.</description>
