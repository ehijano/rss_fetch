      <title>Star-shaped acceptability indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the star-shaped acceptability indexes as generalizations of both the approaches of Cherny and Madan (2009) and Rosazza Gianin and Sgarra (2013) in the same vein as star-shaped risk measures generalize both the classes of coherent and convex risk measures in Castagnoli et al. (2022). We characterize acceptability indexes through star-shaped risk measures, star-shaped acceptance sets, and as the minimum of a family of quasi-concave acceptability indexes. Further, we introduce concrete examples under our approach linked to Value at Risk, risk-adjusted reward on capital, reward-based gain-loss ratio, monotone reward-deviation ratio, and robust acceptability indexes.</description>

      <title>Cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12198v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature of risk measures, cash subadditivity was proposed to replace cash additivity, motivated by the presence of stochastic or ambiguous interest rates and defaultable contingent claims. Cash subadditivity has been traditionally studied together with quasi-convexity, in a way similar to cash additivity with convexity. In this paper, we study cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity. One of our major results is that a general cash-subadditive risk measure can be represented as the lower envelope of a family of quasi-convex and cash-subadditive risk measures. Representation results of cash-subadditive risk measures with some additional properties are also examined. The notion of quasi-star-shapedness, which is a natural analogue of star-shapedness, is introduced and we obtain a corresponding representation result.</description>
