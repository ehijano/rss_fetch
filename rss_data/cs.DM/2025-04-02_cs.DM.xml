      <title>Local Constant Approximation for Dominating Set on Graphs Excluding Large Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that graphs excluding $K_{2,t}$ as a minor admit a $f(t)$-round $50$-approximation deterministic distributed algorithm for \minDS. The result extends to \minVC. Though fast and approximate distributed algorithms for such problems were already known for $H$-minor-free graphs, all of them have an approximation ratio depending on the size of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a large non-trivial excluded minor leading to fast and constant-approximation distributed algorithms, where the ratio is independent of the size of $H$. A new key ingredient in the analysis of these distributed algorithms is the use of \textit{asymptotic dimension}.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorems for Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for paths states that in a simple $P_k$-free graph, $m \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, where $P_k$ denotes a path with length $k$ (that is, with $k$ edges). In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $p(v)$ be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[m \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{p(v)}{2}\] The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for cycles states that in a simple graph $G$ with circumference (that is, the length of the longest cycle) at most $k$, we have $m \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. We strengthen this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[m \leq \left( \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{c(v)}{2} \right) - \frac{c(u)}{2}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>Cutwidth Bounds via Vertex Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cutwidth measure on graphs and ways to bound the cutwidth of a graph by partitioning its vertices. We consider bounds expressed as a function of two quantities: on the one hand, the maximal cutwidth x of the subgraphs induced by the classes of the partition, and on the other hand, the cutwidth y of the quotient multigraph obtained by merging each class to a single vertex. We consider in particular decomposition of directed graphs into strongly connected components (SCCs): in this case, x is the maximal cutwidth of an SCC, and y is the cutwidth of the directed acyclic condensation multigraph.
  We show that the cutwidth of a graph is always in O(x + y), specifically it can be upper bounded by 1.5x + y. We also show a lower bound justifying that the constant 1.5 cannot be improved in general</description>

      <title>Modular Decomposition of Hierarchical Finite State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) are a standard software-modelling concept which extends the classical Finite State Machine (FSM) notion with the useful abstraction of hierarchical nesting. That is, an HFSM is an FSM whose states can be other FSMs. The hierarchy in HFSMs is provided at design time, and can be removed by expanding nested states, allowing HFSMs to inherit the semantics of FSMs. However, because hierarchy is a useful representation of the structure of an FSM, we would like to be able to invert this operation: given an FSM, can we compute equivalent HFSMs? This is the topic of this paper. By adapting the analogous theory of `modular decomposition' from graph theory into automata theory, we are able to compute an efficient representation of the space of equivalent HFSMs to a given one. Specifically, we first define a module of an FSM, which is a collection of nodes which can be treated as a nested FSM. Unlike modules in graphs, some modules in FSMs are lacking in algebraic structure. We identify a simple and natural restriction of the modules, called thin modules, which regain many of the critical properties from modules in graphs. We then construct a linear-space directed graph which uniquely represents every thin module, and hence every equivalent (thin) HFSM. We call this graph the modular decomposition. The modular decomposition makes clear the significant common structure underlying equivalent thin HFSMs. We provide an $O(n^2k)$ algorithm for constructing the modular decomposition of an $n$-state $k$-symbol FSM. We demonstrate the applicability of this theory on the following `bottleneck' problem: given an HFSM, find an equivalent one where the size of the largest component FSM is minimised. The modular decomposition gives a simple greedy algorithm for the bottleneck problem on thin HFSMs, which we demonstrate on a wristwatch HFSM example from Harel (1987).</description>

      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all $2$-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which significantly cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched).</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>

      <title>Aggregation of evaluations without unanimity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dokow and Holzman determined which predicates over $\{0, 1\}$ satisfy an analog of Arrow's theorem: all unanimous aggregators are dictatorial. Szegedy and Xu, extending earlier work of Dokow and Holzman, extended this to predicates over arbitrary finite alphabets.
  Mossel extended Arrow's theorem in an orthogonal direction, determining all aggregators without the assumption of unanimity. We bring together both threads of research by extending the results of Dokow-Holzman and Szegedy-Xu to the setting of Mossel. As an application, we determine, for each symmetric predicate over $\{0,1\}$, all of its aggregators.</description>

      <title>On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for computing all common subgraphs with the maximum number of vertices across multiple graphs. Our approach is further extended to handle the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), identifying the largest common subgraph in terms of either vertices or edges across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is scalable and fast.</description>
