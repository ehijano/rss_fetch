      <title>CaCd$_2$P$_2$: A Visible-Light Absorbing Zintl Phosphide Stable under Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key bottleneck to solar fuels is the absence of stable and strongly absorbing photoelectrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Modern approaches generally trade off between stable but weakly absorbing materials, such as wide bandgap oxides, or strongly absorbing materials that rely on encapsulation for stability and are weakly catalytic, such as the III-V family of semiconductors. Of interest are materials like transition metal phosphides, such as FeP$_2$, that are known to undergo beneficial in situ surface transformations in the oxidative environment of OER, though stability has remained a primary hurdle. Here we report on CaCd$_2$P$_2$, a Zintl phase visible-light absorber with favorable 1.6 eV bandgap, that we identified using high-throughput computational screening. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical measurements, microscopy, and spectroscopy, we show that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ undergoes a light-stabilized surface transformation that renders it stable under alkaline OER conditions. We also show that the well known OER catalyst CoPi can act as a stable co-catalyst in synergy with the \textit{in-situ} CaCd$_2$P$_2$ surface. The light-induced stabilization that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ displays is in sharp contrast to the photocorrosion commonly observed in visible light-absorbing photoelectrodes. The broader AM$_2$P$_2$ family of Zintl phases offers a significant opportunity to explore stabilizing interface chemistry and re-design the manner in which low-bandgap semiconductors are used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Evolution from Topological Dirac Metal to Flat-band-Induced Antiferromagnet in Layered KxNi4S2 (0&lt;=x&lt;=1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</description>

      <title>Predicting void nucleation in microstructure with convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Void nucleation in ductile materials subjected to high strain-rate loading remains a critical yet elusive phenomenon to understand. Traditional methods to understand void nucleation typically rely on experiments and molecular dynamics and do not capture the underlying factors leading to void nucleation. In this study, a convolutional neural network, specifically a U-Net enhanced with attention gates is developed, to predict void nucleation probability in pristine tantalum microstructures. The approach leverages a multi-channel input, incorporating four channels of grain orientations and an additional channel of grain boundary energy calculated via the lattice matching method. Void nucleation probability fields are determined from post-mortem micrographs and serve as ground truth, distinguishing void from no-void regions at the pixel level. Pixel-level class imbalance, commen in such images, is addressed by using Focal loss to guide the network's training to predict void nucleation sites more effectively. The model not only predicts void nucleation sites consistent with ground-truth but also reveals additional potential void nucleation sites, capturing the stochastic nature of void nucleation. This study shows that CNN-based models can predict void nucleation sites while considering combined interplay of factors such as grain boundary energy and grain orientation. In this way, machine learning can serve as a means to understand the underlying factors leading to void nucleation thereby contributing to a fundamental understanding of failure due to spallation in ductile materials.</description>

      <title>Scaling High-Performance Nanoribbon Transistors with Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale transistors require aggressive reduction of all channel dimensions: length, width, and thickness. While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors (2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$- and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths down to 25 nm and lengths down to 50 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130 $\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off (enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future nanosheet transistors.</description>

      <title>Elemental Frequency-Based Supervised Classification Approach for the Search of Novel Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning based approaches efficiently solves the goal of searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have checked the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property screening of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Role of Solvents in DBTTF:HATCN Ternary Cocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition, resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior, revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics, solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues for material design.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals offer access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Here, we investigate the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The (103) surface is an example of a low symmetry surface that presents an apparent paradox to the bulk-boundary correspondence. The surface periodicity to which the topological surface states are expected to adhere does not correspond to the bulk periodicity of the Weyl points. By showing that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate replicas that accumulate into a superlattice commensurate with the surface Brillouin zone, we demonstrate how the apparent bulk boundary correspondence paradox is resolved and establish a universal criterion for arbitrary facets. The framework and experimental results further suggests that overlapping Fermi arcs can hybridize into closed Fermi arc loops, enriching boundary topology and enabling unconventional transport, interference, and collective phenomena unique to lowsymmetry facets.</description>

      <title>Novel 3D Pentagraphene Allotropes: Stability, Electronic, Mechanical, and Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based materials have attracted great attention due to their exceptional structural diversity and wide-ranging applications. Recently, a new two-dimensional carbon allotrope, named pentagraphene (PG), was proposed. In this study, we proposed three novel three-dimensional (3D) PG allotropes, named 3D-PG-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, and -$\gamma$, engineered through biaxial strain and controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Comprehensive stability analyses, including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), confirm their thermodynamic stability under room and high-temperature conditions. 3D-PG-$\alpha$ is the most stable, exhibiting a cohesive energy 0.5 eV/atom lower than the least stable structure, 3D-PG-$\gamma$. Electronic property characterization reveals semiconducting behavior for all structures, with indirect electronic band gaps ranging from 0.91 to 2.67 eV. The analyses of the mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy, with higher stiffness along the in-plane ($xy$-plane) direction. Optical properties highlight strong absorption along a wide range and a pronounced anisotropic response. Additionally, the absorption spectra exhibit activity in the visible region, and the refractive index and reflectivity indicate potential use in ultraviolet-blocking devices.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and transport of nonpolarons in silicon and germanium: the influence of doping and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a first-principles investigation of electron-phonon interactions in silicon and germanium, uncovering distinct non-polaronic spectral and transport fingerprints in these archetypal covalent semiconductors. Using many-body perturbation theory with the retarded cumulant expansion, we compute quasiparticle energies, lifetimes, and phonon satellites beyond the Dyson-Migdal approximation. Short-range crystal fields dominate coupling in both materials, yet their low-temperature spectral fingerprints differ: Si exhibits well-resolved satellites at both band edges, whereas Ge displays strong sidebands mainly at the valence band maximum (VBM) and much weaker features at the conduction band minimum (CBM). Phonon-induced satellites in both materials broaden and merge with the quasiparticle peak at elevated temperatures. Doping broadens peaks and compresses satellite-quasiparticle separation, with n-type carriers affecting the CBM and p-type the VBM. Mobility calculations, combining cumulant-derived phonon scattering with experimentally motivated ionized-impurity scattering models, reproduce measured trends and reveal Ge's consistently higher mobilities than Si, stemming from lighter effective masses and weaker coupling. These results link band-edge asymmetries and phonon energetics to measurable transport differences, providing a unified framework for predicting mobility in nonpolar semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetism Induced by Azanide and Ammonia Adsorption in Defective Molybdenum Disulfide and Diselenide: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$) and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance for spintronic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Competitive Adsorption of Toluene and Water in MFI-type Zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive adsorption is a major challenge in understanding catalytic activity, selectivity and reaction mechanisms in confined environments such as zeolites. This study investigated competitive adsorption in MFI-type zeolites (ZSM-5) using solid-state NMR, focusing on the interplay between toluene and water. Quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy identified three distinct populations of adsorbed toluene evolving with increasing toluene loading. The adsorption behavior was consistent across a series of samples with Si/Al ratio ranging from 11.5 to 140. Combining 1D and 2D NMR techniques with sample engineering (e.g. pore-blocking) enabled the assignment of the populations to toluene within the zeolite channels, at the pore mouths, and adsorbed on the external crystal surface. Crucially, introducing water to toluene-loaded zeolites caused a partial displacement of toluene from the internal channels, but significant removal from the pore mouths. This dis-placement occurred even in the highly hydrophobic zeolite (Si/Al = 140), where water still preferentially adsorbed to Br{\o}nsted acid sites and silanol species. The results highlight the critical impact that competitive adsorption from solvents, products, or impurities can have on the efficiency and selectivity of zeolite-mediated transformations.</description>

      <title>Interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic states in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr exhibits coupling of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom, giving rise to distinctive quasi-particle interactions. We investigate these interactions across a wide temperature range using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy at various excitation energies, complemented by optical absorption and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. Under 1.96 eV excitation, we observe pronounced changes in the A$_g^1$, A$_g^2$, and A$_g^3$ Raman modes near the N\'eel temperature, coinciding with modifications in the oscillator strength of excitonic transitions and clear resonances in PLE. The distinct temperature evolution of Raman tensor elements and polarization anisotropy for Raman modes indicates that they couple to different excitonic and electronic states. The suppression of the excitonic state's oscillation strength above the N\'eel temperature could be related to the magnetic phase transition, thereby connecting these excitonic states and Raman modes to a specific spin alignment. These observations make CrSBr a versatile platform for probing quasi-particle interactions in low-dimensional magnets and provide insights for applications in quantum sensing and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>OpenCSP: A Deep Learning Framework for Crystal Structure Prediction from Ambient to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure crystal structure prediction (CSP) underpins advances in condensed matter physics, planetary science, and materials discovery. Yet, most large atomistic models are trained on near-ambient, equilibrium data, leading to degraded stress accuracy at tens to hundreds of gigapascals and sparse coverage of pressure-stabilized stoichiometries and dense coordination motifs. Here, we introduce OpenCSP, a machine learning framework for CSP tasks spanning ambient to high-pressure conditions. This framework comprises an open-source pressure-resolved dataset alongside a suite of publicly available atomistic models that are jointly optimized for accuracy in energy, force, and stress predictions. The dataset is constructed via randomized high-pressure sampling and iteratively refined through an uncertainty-guided concurrent learning strategy, which enriches underrepresented compression regimes while suppressing redundant DFT labeling. Despite employing a training corpus one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those of leading large models, OpenCSP achieves comparable or superior performance in high-pressure enthalpy ranking and stability prediction. Across benchmark CSP tasks spanning a wide pressure window, our models match or surpass MACE-MPA-0, MatterSim v1 5M, and GRACE-2L-OAM, with the largest gains observed at elevated pressures. These results demonstrate that targeted, pressure-aware data acquisition coupled with scalable architectures enables data-efficient, high-fidelity CSP, paving the way for autonomous materials discovery under ambient and extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a dimerized Kitaev chain revealed by nonlocal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains engineered from semiconducting quantum dots coupled by superconducting segments offer a promising route to realize and control Majorana bound states for topological quantum computation. We study a dimerized Kitaev chain--equivalent to a superconducting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model--and analyze the behavior of the resulting two coupled chains. We show that interference between Majorana edge modes from each chain gives rise to observable signatures in nonlocal conductance. Additionally, we identify a parity effect in the system length that governs the coupling of edge states, supported by an analytical model. Our results provide experimentally accessible probes for Majorana hybridization in mesoscopic topological superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous years researchers began to simulate open quantum system, taking into account the interaction between system and the environment. One approach to deal with this problem is to use the density matrix within the Liouville-von-Neumann formalism or the Markovian variant the Lindblad equations. Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is added to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the dynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix approaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can deal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level system and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix approach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic oscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is necessary and applied it. Like in the classical Langevin equations the friction constant and the random force fluctuations are related by the fluctuation-dissipation constant. We showed that with friction the dynamics decays to an ensemble with energy of $E_{gs}+k_BT$. However, we also found here are problems. The system seems to absorb energy indefinitely if the temperature is higher than the zero point energy or if the system is a Morse oscillator. Thus more research is required to make this method work.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for the absence of coupling between shear strain and superconductivity in Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting symmetry of Sr2RuO4 has been intensely debated for many years. A crucial controversy recently emerged between shear-mode ultrasound experiments, which suggest a two-component order parameter, and some uniaxial pressure experiments that suggest a one-component order parameter. To resolve this controversy, we use a new approach to directly apply three different kinds of shear strain to single crystals of Sr2RuO4 and investigate the coupling to superconductivity. After characterising the strain by optical imaging, we observe variations of the transition temperature Tc smaller than 10mK/% as measured by low-frequency magnetic susceptibility, indicating that shear strain has little to no coupling to superconductivity. Our results are consistent with a one-component order parameter model, but such a model cannot consistently explain other experimental evidence such as time-reversal symmetry breaking, superconducting domains, and horizontal line nodes, thus calling for alternative interpretations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Electrical Transport in SnSe$_2$ Nanosheets: Role of Thickness and Surface Defect States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the influence of thickness on the electrical transport properties of mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional SnSe$_2$ nanosheets, derived from the bulk single crystal. Contrary to conventional trend observed in two-dimensional systems, we find a semiconducting to metallic resistivity behavior with decreasing thickness. The analysis of low-temperature conduction indicates an increased density of states at Fermi-level with decreasing thickness, which is further corroborated by gate bias dependent conductance measurement. The enhanced conductivity in thinner flake is attributed to the n-type doping arising from surface defect states. The presence and evolution of these defect states with thickness is probed by thickness-dependent room-temperature Raman spectroscopy. Our study provides insights into the thickness-dependent electronic transport mechanism of SnSe$_2$ and the crucial role of defect states in governing the observed conductivity behavior.</description>

      <title>Disorder-driven Weyl-Kondo Semimetal Phase in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation, reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$ as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>MatSKRAFT: A framework for large-scale materials knowledge extraction from scientific tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly depends on synthesizing knowledge across vast literature, yet most experimental data remains trapped in semi-structured formats that resist systematic extraction and analysis. Here, we present MatSKRAFT, a computational framework that automatically extracts and integrates materials science knowledge from tabular data at unprecedented scale. Our approach transforms tables into graph-based representations processed by constraint-driven GNNs that encode scientific principles directly into model architecture. MatSKRAFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art large language models, achieving F1 scores of 88.68 for property extraction and 71.35 for composition extraction, while processing data $19$-$496\times$ faster than them (compared to the slowest and the fastest models, respectively) with modest hardware requirements. Applied to nearly 69,000 tables from more than 47,000 research publications, we construct a comprehensive database containing over 535,000 entries, including 104,000 compositions that expand coverage beyond major existing databases, pending manual validation. This systematic approach reveals previously overlooked materials with distinct property combinations and enables data-driven discovery of composition-property relationships forming the cornerstone of materials and scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of high-quality Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) directly on dielectric substrates is crucial for electronic and optoelectronic applications, but there are still challenges such as poor quality, uncontrollable thickness and polycrystalline films. In this work, a novel method to grow high-quality and single-crystalline BLG directly on various dielectric substrates (SiO2/Si, sapphire, and quartz) was demonstrated. Single-crystalline monolayer graphene was applied as a seeding layer to facilitate the homo-epitaxial synthesis of single-crystalline BLG directly on insulating substrates. The Cu nano-powders (Cu NPs) with nanostructure and high surface-area were used as the remote catalysis to provide long-lasting catalytic activity during the graphene growth. The TEM results confirm the single-crystalline nature of the BLG domains, which validates the superiority of the homo-epitaxial growth technique. The as-grown BLG show comparable quality with the CVD-grown BLG on metal surface. Field-effect transistors directly fabricated on the as-grown BLG/SiO2/Si showed a room temperature carrier mobility as high as 2297cm2/Vs.</description>

      <title>Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. By explicitly incorporating space group symmetry, CrystalFormer greatly reduces the effective complexity of crystal space, which is essential for data-and compute-efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and coordinates of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution over widely used conventional approaches. Furthermore, we showcase its plug-and-play application to property-guided materials design, highlighting its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials space. The simplicity, generality, and adaptability of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Prediction and identification of point defect fingerprints in X-ray photoelectron spectra of TiN$_x$ with 1.18 $\le x \le$ 1.37</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of selected N and Ti point defects in $B$1 TiN on N 1s and Ti\,2p$_{3/2}$ binding energies (BE) by experiments and ab initio calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of TiN$_x$ films with 1.18 $\le x \le$ 1.37 reveal additional N 1s spectral components at lower binding energies. Ab initio calculations predict that these components are caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce a N 1s BE shift of -0.54 eV in its first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N 1s BE shifted by -1.18 eV and shift the BE of their first N neighbors by -0.53 eV. However, based on {\it ab initio} data the tetrahedral N interstitial is estimated to be unstable at room temperature. We, therefore, unambiguously attribute the N 1s spectral components at lower BE in Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ thin films to the presence of Ti vacancies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the vacancy concentration in Al-capped Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ can be quantified with the here proposed correlative method based on measured and predicted BE data. Our work highlights the potential of ab initio-guided XPS measurements for detecting and quantifying point defects in $B$1 TiN$_x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driving of vibrational motion by external electric fields is a topic of continued interest, due to the possibility of assessing new or metastable material phases with desirable properties. Here, we combine ab initio molecular dynamics within the electric-dipole approximation with machine-learning neural networks (NNs) to develop a general, efficient and accurate method to perform electric-field-driven nuclear dynamics for molecules, solids, and liquids. We train equivariant and autodifferentiable NNs for the interatomic potential and the dipole, modifying the model infrastructure to account for the multi-valued nature of the latter in periodic systems. We showcase the method by addressing property modifications induced by electric field interactions in a polar liquid and a polar solid from nanosecond-long molecular dynamics simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. For liquid water, we present a calculation of the dielectric function in the GHz to THz range and the electrofreezing transition, showing that nuclear quantum effects enhance this phenomenon. For the ferroelectric perovskite LiNbO$_3$, we simulate the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition and the non-equilibrium dynamics of driven phonon modes related to the polarization switching mechanisms, showing that a full polarization switch is not achieved in the simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized complex materials design by enabling rapid exploration of material configurational spaces via crystal structure prediction with ab initio accuracy. However, critical challenges persist in ensuring robust generalization to unknown structures and minimizing the requirement for substantial expert knowledge and time-consuming manual interventions. Here, we propose an automated crystal structure prediction framework built upon the attention-coupled neural networks potential to address these limitations. The generalizability of the potential is achieved by sampling regions across the local minima of the potential energy surface, where the self-evolving pipeline autonomously refines the potential iteratively while minimizing human intervention. The workflow is validated on Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems by exploring nearly 10 million configurations, demonstrating substantial speedup compared to first-principles calculations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating the exploration and discovery of complex multi-component functional materials.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between quantum magnetism and many-body physics is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. %Magnetic exchange interactions in frustrated lattices give rise to rich phase diagrams. Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for exploring the exotic quantum phases arising from complex orderings in frustrated lattices. Here we demonstrate a showcase system based on altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks, which can be constructed from a C$_{40}$ molecular synthon with two effective spin-1/2 sites due to the resonance structures. The charge-neutral, pure-carbon systems exhibit an altermagnetic ground state with fully compensated spins arranged in alternating C$_{40}$ units in a 2D rutile-like lattice, leading to $d$-wave splitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnons. We report a rich phase diagram including altermagentic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be accessed via moderate strains. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring quantum many-body physics based on scalable, chemically-feasible, molecular quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations. Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are crucial.</description>

      <title>Integration of promising piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties in Janus In$XY$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te; $Y$ = Cl, Br, I) monolayers and their heterojunctions</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials show great promise as piezoelectric materials and photocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the hexagonal Janus In$XY$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te; $Y$ = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight In$XY$ MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric coefficients ($|d_{22}|$ = 6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known 2D materials. In$XY$ MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer polarization field $E_{\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies (0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses ($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance $E_{\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, these In$XY$ MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899 cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which effectively suppresses charge recombination. Among them, several stand out: InSI and InSeBr MLs show high electron mobility and a large carrier mobility anisotropy ratio; InSeBr ML exhibits excellent in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectricity; and InSeBr, InSeI, and InTe$Y$ ($Y$ = Cl, Br, I) MLs show strong visible-light absorption. To optimize performance, we constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study clarifies the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel. Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm diffusible hydrogen), followed by slow strain tensile testing (10-4 s-1), resulted in a brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies indicated that surface crack initiation consists of intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology; site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. A mixed-mode morphology consisting of ductile and brittle features was observed adjacent to crack initiation. It differs from the previous investigation of uncharged DP steel, wherein a predominant brittle fracture was observed. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture; site-specific TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies revealed {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies were performed on the cross-sectional cracks. We explain the HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism. During loading, hydrogen diffuses to the prior austenite grain boundary, resulting in hydrogen-induced decohesion. Subsequent hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity (&gt;Vcrit). The high crack velocity effectively inhibits crack blunting via dislocation emission, ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after hydrogen depletion at the crack tip, resulting in {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Based on TEM observations, we explain the formation of river pattern features on the {100} cleavage surface.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Effect Dependent on Electric Field Direction in a Pyroelectric Ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the dependence of the static magnetoelectric (ME) effect on the external field direction in the pyroelectric-ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$, a topic that remains largely unexplored compared to dynamical nonreciprocal ME effects. We measured the magnetization with respect to the inherent polarization and found that an external electric field stabilizes the ferrimagnetic phase when applied parallel to the polarization, and destabilizes it when antiparallel. These results clearly demonstrate the electric-field-direction dependent control of the static ME effect, suggesting a new route to enhancing ME effects in pyroelectric-magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Dipolar-octupolar correlations and hierarchy of exchange interactions in Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution neutron spectroscopy on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ reveals a correlated state characterized by distinct dipolar scattering signals -- quasi-elastic and inelastic contributions consistent with `photon' and `spinon' excitations in quantum spin ice. These signals coexist with weak octupolar scattering. Fits of thermodynamic data using numerical methods indicate a dominant octupolar exchange, $J_{x}$ or $J_{y}$, with substantial dipolar $J_{z}$ and minute dipole-octupole $J_{xz}$ couplings. The $J_{xz}$ value is corroborated by an independent fit of the neutron scattering amplitude balance between dipolar and octupolar `photon' contributions, highlighting its importance to understand neutron scattering results in this family. Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ enriches the landscape of dipole-octupole pyrochlore physics, and reveals a `quantum multipolar liquid' where hybrid correlations involve multiple terms in moment series expansion, opening questions on their intertwining and hierarchy in quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</description>

      <title>Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$:($^{111}$In$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd at the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of an integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and double-approach experimental study we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>
