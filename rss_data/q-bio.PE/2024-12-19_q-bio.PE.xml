      <title>Insecticide treated bed net use and elimination of malaria in Sub-Saharan African countries: Assessing the Global Technical Strategy (GTS) using an evolutionary game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WHO 2021 malaria report revealed that its Global Technical Strategy (GTS) 2020 milestones for morbidity and mortality, based on the 2015 baseline, have not been achieved globally -- the world is off-track by 42% and, can be extended up to 91% in 2030. Most of the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries failed to achieve GTS 2020 -- only 4 out of 40 highest burden countries met the goals. By fitting evolutionary game modeling to the malaria case and Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITN) usages data, we identify factors contributing to the GTS 2020 failures of 38 SSA countries. We use optimized projection of our model to evaluate further the potential achievement of GTS 2025 and 2030 objectives and discuss strategies for attaining goals in situations where these milestones seem unattainable. Our findings categorize all 38 countries based on the possibility to achieve their future milestone, either through increased campaigns, or by economic assistance, or through enhancing the efficacy of ITNs at minimal expense.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra Systems and Complex Balanced Polyexponential Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global stability of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with generalized polynomial right-hand side, without restrictions on the number of variables or the polynomial degree, including negative and non-integer degree. We introduce polyexponential dynamical systems, which are equivalent to the generalized Lotka-Volterra systems, and we use an analogy to the theory of mass-action kinetics to define and analyze complex balanced polyexponential systems, and implicitly analyze complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. We prove that complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems have globally attracting states, up to standard conservation relations, which become linear for the associated polyexponential systems. In particular, complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems cannot give rise to periodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, or other complex dynamical behaviors. We describe a simple sufficient condition for complex balance in terms of an associated graph structure, and we use it to analyze specific examples.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>

      <title>Game susceptibility, Correlation and Payoff capacity as a measure of Cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of some Social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytically, finding the origins of cooperative behavior in infinite-player games is an exciting topic of current interest. In this paper, we compare three analytical methods, i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM), Darwinian selection (DS) and Aggregate selection (AS), with a numerical Agent based method (ABM) via the game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity as indicators of cooperative behaviour. While the analytical NEM model shows excellent agreement with the numerical ABM, the other analytical models, like AS and DS, show notable divergence with ABM in the thermodynamic limit for the indicators in question. Previously, cooperative behavior was studied by considering game magnetization and individual players' average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding cooperative behavior in social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. The results obtained via NEM and ABM are in good agreement for all three indicators in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods games. After comparing the results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players' average payoff and payoff capacity serve as the best indicators to study cooperative behavior among players in the thermodynamic limit.</description>
