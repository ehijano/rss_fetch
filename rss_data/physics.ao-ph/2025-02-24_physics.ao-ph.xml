      <title>Photomolecular Effect as A Potential Explanation for The Cloud Absorption Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud absorption is acknowledged as the biggest source of uncertainty in the climate models. For over 70 years, many experiments have reported clouds absorbing more solar radiation than theory could predict. In the visible spectrum, simulations based on optical constants of water lead to negligible cloud absorption. This result had been explored by some experimentalists to calibrate the cloud absorption measurements. However, the author and his collaborators recently discovered that visible light can directly cleave off water molecular clusters at liquid-air interfaces (PNAS, e2312751120, 2023; e2320844121, 2024), which is named the photomolecular effect in analogy to the photoelectric effect. This discovery suggests that a crucial piece of physics has been missing in the existing theories: light can be absorbed at water-air interface. The photomolecular effect can be simulated by generalizing the boundary conditions for the Maxwell equations using Feibelman parameters that were derived in the past research on the surface photoelectric effect and surface plasmons. In this work, the author uses simulation to show that including the photomolecular effect at the air-water interface can potentially explain the cloud absorption anomaly. Although the lack of accurate Feibelman parameter values prevents a direct comparison of the current theory with experiments, this work points to an unexplored mechanism for explaining the cloud absorption anomaly and calls for further investigation on the impacts of photomolecular effect in the climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Mid-latitude interactions expand the Hadley circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hadley circulation describes a planetary-scale tropical atmospheric flow, which has a major influence on climate. Contemporary theoretical understanding is based upon angular momentum conservation, the basic dynamical constraint governing the state of the flow pattern. However, despite the degree of success in representing the Hadley circulation, the canonical theoretical model does not treat interactions with other regions, particularly the mid-latitudes. Here, we extend the original model of Held and Hou (1980) to include the influence of mid-latitude large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which we treat using the planetary-scale heat equation with a parameterized poleward heat flux driven by synoptic eddies. The energy flux balance within the Hadley cell includes the poleward heat flux at the poleward edge of the cell, which is controlled by the baroclinic instability of the sub-tropical jet. We find that an increase (decrease) in the poleward heat flux leads to a strengthening (weakening) tropical convection, driving an equatorward (poleward) shift of the edge of the Hadley cell. Thus, our theoretical solutions suggest that global warming, which can reduce the baroclinicity of the subtropical jet, can lead to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell due to the change in energy flux balance within it.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia holds the largest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. In the face of climate change, precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for hydrological modelling in this area. Future precipitation predictions remain challenging due to complex orography, lack of in situ hydrological observations, and limitations in climate model resolution and parametrisation for this region. To address the uncertainty posed by these challenges, climate models are often aggregated into multi-model ensembles. While multi-model ensembles are known to improve the predictive accuracy and analysis of future climate projections, consensus regarding how models are aggregated is lacking. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine 13 regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over High Mountain Asia. Our approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The framework is validated against gridded historical precipitation data and is used to generate projections for the near future (2036$\unicode{x2013}$2065) and far future (2066$\unicode{x2013}$2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.</description>
