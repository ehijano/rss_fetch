      <title>Three forms of the Erd\H{o}s-Dushnik-Miller Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the Erd\H{o}s-Dushnik-Miller theorem (A graph with an uncountable set of vertices has either an infinite independent set or an uncountable clique) in set theory without the axiom of choice. We show that there are three inequivalent versions of this theorem and we give some results about the positions of these versions in the deductive hierarchy of weak choice principles.</description>

      <title>Almost refinement, reaping, and ultrafilter numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combinatorial structure of the set of maximal antichains in a Boolean algebra ordered by almost refinement. We also consider the reaping relation and its associated cardinal invariants, focusing in particular on reduced powers of Boolean algebras. As an application, we obtain that, on the one hand, the ultrafilter number of the Cohen algebra is greater than or equal to the cofinality of the meagre ideal and, on the other hand, a suitable parametrized diamond principle implies that the ultrafilter number of the Cohen algebra is equal to $\aleph_1$.</description>

      <title>Quantum set theory: Equality and order of internal reals defined through different quantum conditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum logic, there is a well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for conditionals. We currently have three candidates: the Sasaki conditional, the contrapositive Sasaki conditional, and the relevance conditional. A fundamental problem is to show how the form of the conditional follows from an analysis of experimental concepts in quantum theory. Here, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory. For each of the above conditionals, we previously introduced an interpretation of quantum set theory, a quantum logical truth value assignment to every set-theoretical statement, that satisfies both the full forms of De Morgan's laws and the transfer principle. In the present study, we explore the structure of the internal reals based on the new interpretations with different conditionals. We show that the externally defined set of the internal reals is identical for each choice among the above three conditionals, and that for the logic represented by a projection lattice on a Hilbert space, the internal reals are in one-to-one correspondence with the self-adjoint operators (or equivalently, quantum observables) affiliated with the von Neumann algebra generated by the logic. Moreover, we show that the truth values for their equality are also irrespective of the choice among the conditionals. Interestingly, however, the truth values for the order relation significantly depend on the underlying conditionals, whereas the order relation holds with the full truth value if and only if their corresponding self-adjoint operators satisfy Olson's spectral order relation irrespective of the choice of the conditional. We describe the difference of the interpretations of the order relation for two internal reals in terms of the order relation, well defined in quantum mechanics, of outcomes from the successive projective measurements of the corresponding two quantum observables.</description>

      <title>Generic Absoluteness Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the relation between recurrence axioms and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms in light of principles of generic absoluteness and the Ground Axiom.
  M. Viale proved that Martin's Maximum$^{++}$ together with the assumption that there are class many Woodin cardinals implies $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}}\prec_{\Sigma_2}\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}[\mathbb{G}]}$ for a generic $\mathbb{G}$ on any stationary preserving $\mathbb{P}$ which also preserves Bounded Martin's Maximum. We show that a similar but more general conclusion follows from each of $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_{\Sigma_2}$-${\sf RcA}^+$ (which is a fragment of a reformulation of the Maximality Principle for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(\kappa)$), and the existence of the tightly $\mathcal{P}$-Laver-generically huge cardinal.
  While under "$\mathcal{P}=$ all stationary preserving posets", our results are not very much more than Viale's Theorem, for other classes of posets, "$\mathcal{P}=$ all proper posets" or "$\mathcal{P}=$ all ccc posets", for example, our theorems are not at all covered by his theorem.
  The assumptions (and hence also the conclusion) of Viale's Theorem are compatible with the Ground Axiom. In contrast, we show that the assumptions of our theorems (for most of the common settings of $\mathcal{P}$ and with a modification of the large cardinal property involved) imply the negation of the Ground Axiom. This fact is used to show that fragments of Recurrence Axiom $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$-${\sf RcA}^+$ can be different from the corresponding fragments of Maximality Principle ${\sf MP}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$ for $\Gamma=\Pi_2$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Pi_3$.</description>
