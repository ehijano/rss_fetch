      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Meta-Graphene and Valleytronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-patterned semiconductor interfaces offer a versatile platform for creating quantum metamaterials and exploring novel electronic phenomena. In this study, we illustrate this concept using artificial graphene--a metamaterial featuring distinctive properties including Dirac and saddle points. We demonstrate that introducing additional nano-patterning can open a Dirac band gap, giving rise to what we term artificial hexagonal boron nitride (AhBN). The calculated valley Chern number of AhBN indicates the presence of topological valley Hall states confined to Dirac-gap domain walls. A key question is whether these one-dimensional edge states are topologically protected against disorder, given their vulnerability to Anderson localization. To this end, we perform band structure and electronic transport simulations under experimentally relevant disorder, including charge puddles and geometric imperfections. Our results reveal the resilience of the domain wall states against typical experimental disorder, particularly while the AhBN band gap remains open. The localization length along the domain wall can reach several microns--several times longer than the bulk electron mean free path--even though the number of bulk transport channels is greater. To enhance the effectiveness of the low-dissipation domain wall channel, we propose ribbon geometries with a large length-to-width ratio. These findings underscore both the potential and challenges of AhBN for low-energy, power-efficient microelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Protection in a Landau Flat Band at $\nu=7/11$, a Candidate Filling Factor for Unconventional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong interactions in Landau flat bands are known to stabilize correlated states that do not form in other types of flat bands. We report hallmarks of topological protection at the Landau level filling factor v=7/11 in a two-dimensional electron system. The $\nu=7/11$ filling factor is the particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=4/11$, a filling factor intensely studied for the possibility of realizing unconventional electronic correlations. Our data establishes a new instance for an unusual fractional quantum Hall state and opens up possibilities for the study of unconventional correlations in an enlarged parameter space. We report and discuss transport signatures developing at other filling factors of interest $\nu= 11/17$, $5/8$, and $8/13$, which however in our sample do not exhibit topological protection.</description>

      <title>Switchable spin-photon coupling with hole spins in single-quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots offer a gate-tunable platform for quantum information processing. While two-qubit interactions are typically realized through exchange coupling between neighboring spins, coupling spin qubits to photons via hybrid spin-cQED devices enables long-range interactions and integration with other cQED platforms. Here, we investigate hole spin-photon coupling in compact single quantum dot setups. By incorporating ubiquitous strain inhomogeneities to our theory, we identify three main spin-photon coupling channels: a vector-potential-spin-orbit geometric mechanism--dominant for vertical magnetic fields--, an inhomogeneous Rashba term generalizing previous spin-orbit field models, and strain-induced $g$-tensor terms--most relevant for in-plane fields. Comparing Si, unstrained (relaxed) Ge, and biaxially strained Ge wells, we find that Si and unstrained Ge provide optimal coupling strengths (tens of MHz) thanks to their reduced heavy-hole, light-hole splitting. We demonstrate efficient switching of the spin-photon coupling while preserving sweet spot operation. Finally, we evaluate quantum state transfer and two-qubit gate protocols, achieving $&gt;99\%$ fidelity for state transfer and $&gt;90\%$ for two-qubit gates with realistic coherence times, establishing single-dot hole spins as a viable platform for compact spin-cQED architectures and highlighting unstrained Ge as a promising candidate for spin-photon interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of a charge qubit via point contacts with complex internal structures is considered. In this context, a fully formalized derivation of the many-body wave function method is presented, together with the corresponding master equations for point contacts possessing an arbitrary number of internal states. The focus is placed on the current noise power spectrum and its dependence on the qubit dynamics and the point contact parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Effect of Thermal-Induced Atomic Motion on the Conductance of Copper Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.</description>

      <title>Probing orbital currents through inverse orbital Hall and Rashba effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of orbital-to-charge conversion in metallic and semiconductor materials, emphasizing the fundamental roles of the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) and the inverse orbital Rashba effect. Using spin pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) and the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), we demonstrate efficient orbital current generation and detection in YIG/Pt/NM structures, where NM is either a metal or a semiconductor. A central finding is the dominance of orbital contributions over spin-related effects, even in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. In particular, a large enhancement of the SP-FMR and SSE signals is observed in the presence of naturally oxidized Cu in different heterostructures. Furthermore, we identify positive and negative IOHE signals in Ti and Ge, respectively, and extract orbital diffusion lengths in both systems using a diffusive model. Our results confirm the presence of orbital transport and offer valuable insights that may guide the further development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Engineering Magnetic States and Magnetoresistance in Bisegmented Co-Ni Jellyfish Nanowires via Interplay of Shape and Magnetocrystalline Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding the spectrum of 3D magnetic nanostructures requires mastering the interplay between different anisotropy contributions. Here, we fabricate bisegmented jellyfish nanowires with tailored arrangements of Co (strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy) and Ni (dominant shape anisotropy) segments. We uncover a unique magnetic duality: Co segments can be tuned to exhibit either a flux-closing multidomain state or a shape-anisotropy-dominated vortex configuration, directly governed by their geometry. This local domain structure, imaged by MFM and simulated micromagnetically, dictates the global magnetic response-suppressing magnetostatic interactions in arrays and enabling the programming of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in single nanowires. Our work provides a blueprint for designing functional magnetic nanomaterials where magnetoresistive properties are engineered through strategic anisotropy control.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in gapless graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is also illustrated with respect to configurational fluctuations, demonstrating their potential detectability in realistic devices and suggesting transport spectroscopy as a practical probe of valley-dependent topological interface physics in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Quantum Capacitance Between Two Metallic Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two factors contribute to the electrical capacitance between two electrodes: a classical contribution, stemming from the electric field, and a quantum contribution, governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which increases the difficulty of adding charge to the electrodes. In metals, the high electronic Density of States (DOS) at the Fermi energy allows the quantum contribution to be neglected, and a classical description of the electrical capacitance between two metallic electrodes is normally used. Here, we study the evolution of the capacitance as two metallic electrodes (Pt or Au) are approached to the limit when quantum corrections are needed, before contact formation. At small distances, we observe that the classical increase in capacitance turns into saturation as the electrodes are approached, reaching the quantum capacitance limit. Finally, a capacitance leakage due to quantum tunneling is observed. Since the quantum capacitance depends on the electronic DOS on the surface of the electrodes, we use it to probe the DOS change induced by molecular adsorption (Toluene) on the metallic surface.</description>

      <title>Superfluid weight in disordered flat-band superconductors as a competition between localization functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Anderson's theorem, the gap of a time-reversal symmetric weak-coupling superconductor is unaffected by non-magnetic disorder. However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint statistics and fluctuation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Signatures of superconducting Higgs mode in irradiated Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Higgs mode, originally proposed in the context of superconductivity, corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. Recent THz-domain optical studies have found signatures consistent with the Higgs mode, but its unambiguous detection is still challenging. We predict that the existence of the Higgs mode can be unambiguously revealed by standard measurements of the transport characteristics in microwave-irradiated asymmetric and transparent Josephson junctions. One signature of the Higgs mode in a Josephson junction is the microwave-induced enhancement of the second harmonic of the equilibrium current-phase relation (at zero DC bias voltage), whose sign differs from its expected value in the absence of the Higgs mode. As the radiation frequency is varied, this enhancement exhibits resonant behavior when the microwave frequency is tuned across the Higgs mass. The second signature that we propose is the enhancement of the second harmonic of the AC Josephson current at finite DC voltage bias, which can be probed in a customary analysis of the Shapiro steps in a microwave-irradiated junction.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Magnon Interaction Induced by Dynamic Coupling in a Hybrid Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and numerical investigation of spin-wave dynamics in a hybrid magnonic crystal consisting of a CoFeB artificial spin ice (ASI) of stadium-shaped nanoelements patterned atop a continuous NiFe film, separated by a 5 nm Al2O3 spacer. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we probe the frequency dependence of thermal spin waves as functions of applied magnetic field and wavevector, revealing the decisive role of interlayer dipolar coupling in the magnetization dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations complement the experiments, showing a strong interplay between ASI edge modes and backward volume modes in the NiFe film. The contrast in saturation magnetization between CoFeB and NiFe enhances this coupling, leading to a pronounced hybridization manifested as a triplet of peaks in the spectra - predicted by simulations and observed experimentally. This magnon-magnon coupling persists over a wide magnetic field range, shaping both the spin-wave dispersion and frequency-field response throughout the hysteresis loop. Our findings establish how ASI geometry can selectively enhance specific spin-wave wavelengths in the underlying film, identifying them as preferential channels for magnonic signal transport and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Fermionic versus Spin Baths in non-Interacting Transport Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how fermionic anticommutation shapes transport in a noninteracting resonant-level model where a single central site is coupled to an environment. To this end, we compare a fermionic reservoir with a bath of spin-half modes using exact diagonalization and a perturbative expansion of the master equation to identify the differences. Notably, we find different reduced dynamics for the spin and fermionic baths even though the particles remain noninteracting and both models enforce local Pauli blocking. These differences originate from higher-order terms in the system-bath coupling, where fermionic anticommutation introduces exchange signs in higher-order correlations. By contrast, all second-order contributions, set solely by two-point correlators, coincide. Deviations are largest for small to intermediate bath sizes, fading in the effectively Markovian regime where higher-order corrections are negligible. These results identify when spin baths can be a substitute for fermionic reservoirs and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Universal super-resolution framework for imaging of quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal deep-learning method that reconstructs super-resolved images of quantum emitters from a single camera frame measurement. Trained on physics-based synthetic data spanning diverse point-spread functions, aberrations, and noise, the network generalizes across experimental conditions without system-specific retraining. We validate the approach on low- and high-density In(Ga)As quantum dots and strain-induced dots in 2D monolayer WSe$_2$, resolving overlapping emitters even under low signal-to-noise and inhomogeneous backgrounds. By eliminating calibration and iterative acquisitions, this single-shot strategy enables rapid, robust super-resolution for nanoscale characterization and quantum photonic device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drudelike features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning.We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized electrostatic SWAP gate realized in a chain of two double quantum dots operated in the single-electron regime. Using a minimalist tight-binding model, we derive analytical results and corroborate them with numerical simulations. We exploit the charge anticorrelation arising from Coulomb repulsion and quantify the resulting entanglement generation. We contrast classical and quantum descriptions and show how device geometry and coupling strengths govern entanglement dynamics and gate performance. The results are relevant to cryogenic, CMOS-compatible quantum technologies and suggest a route toward large-scale semiconductor implementations of quantum logic. Finally, we outline a systematic procedure for translating classical electrostatic logic gates into single-electron quantum gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil novel spin-orbit torque mechanisms driven by topological edge states in magnetic graphene-based devices. Within the energy gap, a damping-like torque plateau emerges within the quantum anomalous Hall phase upon breaking particle-hole symmetry, while for energies at the spin-split Dirac points located within the bands, a large damping-like torque develops as a result of a vanishing Fermi contour. Such torques are tunable by the degree of spin-pseudospin entanglement dictated by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling terms.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Exact Solution for Driven Landau Levels in Two-dimensional Electron Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems with time-dependent fields opens avenues for engineering novel states of matter and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. Landau levels in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), with their discrete energy spectrum and characteristic cyclotron dynamics, provide an important platform for realizing and studying such driven quantum systems. While exact solutions for driven Landau levels exist, they have been limited to specific gauges or representations. In this work, we present an algebraic, gauge- and representation-independent exact solution for driven Landau levels in 2DEGs subject to arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our approach, based on a time-dependent unitary transformation via the displacement operator, provides clear physical insights into the driven quantum dynamics. We apply this method to derive the exact Floquet states and quasienergies for periodically driven Landau levels, and we extend our analysis to the resonant driving regime, where the Floquet picture breaks down and the electron wavefunction exhibits unbounded spatial spreading. Furthermore, we calculate the instantaneous energy absorption rate, revealing distinct absorption behaviors between coherent states and Fock or thermal states, stemming from quantum interference effects.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Decoupling thermoelectric coefficients of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical framework of electron dynamics. Our study shows that an intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. We find that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence dynamics in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Extreme anharmonicity and thermal contraction of 1D wires</title>

Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal an exponential decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</description>
