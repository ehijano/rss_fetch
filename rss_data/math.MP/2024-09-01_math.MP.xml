      <description>arXiv:2408.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the independence number, zero-error capacity, and the values of the Lov\'asz function and the quantum Lov\'asz function for the quantum graph associated to the partial trace quantum channel $\operatorname{Tr}_n\otimes\mathrm{id}_k\colon\operatorname{B}(\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^k)\to\operatorname{B}(\mathbb{C}^k)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic method of group classification for semi-normalized classes of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of semi-normalized classes of systems of differential equations, study properties of such classes and extend the algebraic method of group classification to them. In particular, we prove the important theorems on factoring out symmetry groups and invariance algebras of systems from semi-normalized classes and on splitting such groups and algebras within disjointedly semi-normalized classes. Nontrivial particular examples of classes that arise in real-world applications and showcase the relevance of the developed theory are provided. To convincingly illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we apply it to the group classification problem for the class of linear Schr\"odinger equations with complex-valued potentials and the general value of the space dimension. We compute the equivalence groupoid of the class by the direct method and thus show that this class is uniformly semi-normalized with respect to the linear superposition of solutions. This is why the group classification problem reduces to the classification of specific low-dimensional subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra, which is completely realized for the case of space dimension two. Splitting into different classification cases is based on three integer parameters that are invariant with respect to equivalence transformations. We also single out those of the obtained results that are relevant to linear Schr\"odinger equations with real-valued potentials.</description>

      <title>Long time quantum-classical correspondence for open systems in trace norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

      <title>Modular anomaly of BPS back holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the bulk polarization in extended and localized phases of a quasiperiodic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite size scaling of the bulk polarization in a quasiperiodic (Aubry-Andr\'{e}) model using the geometric analog of the Binder cumulant. As a proof of concept we show that the geometric Binder cumulant method described here can reproduce the known literature values for the flat and raised cosine distributions, which are the two distributions that occur in the delocalized phase. For the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model at half-filling the phase transition point is accurately reproduced. Not only is the correct size scaling exponent of the variance obtained in the extended and the localized phases, but the geometric Binder cumulant undergoes a sign change at the phase transition. We also calculate the state resolved Binder cumulant as a function of disorder strength to gain insight into the mechanism of the localization transition.</description>

      <title>Sharp arithmetic delocalization for quasiperiodic operators with potentials of semi-bounded variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the sharp arithmetic Gordon's theorem: that is, absence of eigenvalues on the set of energies with Lyapunov exponent bounded by the exponential rate of approximation of frequency by the rationals, for a large class of one-dimensional quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators, with no (modulus of) continuity required. The class includes all unbounded monotone potentials with finite Lyapunov exponents and all potentials of bounded variation. The main tool is a new uniform upper bound on iterates of cocycles of bounded variation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models -- developed to approach spacetime quantization -- can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many future of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models.</description>

Abstract: We construct a generalization of the $C^\vee C_1$-type double affine Hecke algebra for the skein algebra on the twice-punctured torus $\Sigma_{1,2}$ using the Heegaard dual of the Iwahori--Hecke operator recently introduced in our previous article. We show that the automorphisms of our algebra correspond to the Dehn twists about the curves on $\Sigma_{1,2}$. We also give the cluster algebraic construction of the the classical limit of the skein algebra, where the Dehn twists are given in terms of the cluster mutations.</description>

      <title>The variational principle for a marked Gibbs point process with infinite-range multibody interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Gibbs variational principle for the Asakura--Oosawa model in which particles of random size obey a hardcore constraint of non-overlap and are additionally subject to a temperature-dependent area interaction. The particle size is unbounded, leading to infinite-range interactions, and the potential cannot be written as a $k$-body interaction for fixed $k$. As a byproduct, we also prove the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs point processes satisfying the DLR equations. The essential control over the influence of boundary conditions can be established using the geometry of the model and the hard-core constraint.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ permutation gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a (unitary) $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ permutation gauging of a (unitary) modular category $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, the formula for the modular data of the gauged theory is provided in terms of modular data of $\mathcal{C}$, which provides positive evidence of the reconstruction program. Moreover as a direct consequence, the formula for the fusion rules is derived, generalizing the results of Edie-Michell-Jones-Plavnik. Our construction explicitly shows the genus-$0$ data of the gauged theory contains higher genus data of the original theory. As applications, we obtain an identity for the modular data that does not come from modular group relations, and we prove that representations of the symmetric mapping class group (associated to closed surfaces) coming from weakly group theoretical modular categories have finite images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing deformation quantizations with separation of variables of a K\"ahler manifold $M$, we adopt Fedosov's gluing argument to construct a category $\mathsf{DQ}$, enriched over sheaves of $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-modules on $M$, as a quantization of the category of Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being smooth sections of hom-bundles.
  We then define quantizable morphisms among objects in $\mathsf{DQ}$, generalizing Chan-Leung-Li's notion [4] of quantizable functions. Upon evaluation of quantizable morphisms at $\hbar = \tfrac{\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, we obtain an enriched category $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$. We show that, when $M$ is prequantizable, $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$ is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{GQ}$ of holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being holomorphic differential operators, via a functor obtained from Bargmann-Fock actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider log-correlated random fields $X$ and the associated multiplicative chaos measures $\mu_{\gamma,X}$. Our results reconstruct the underlying field $X$ from the multiplicative chaos measure $\nu_{\gamma,X}$. The new feature of our results is that we allow the dimension $d$ to be arbitrary and cover also the critical case $\gamma=\sqrt{2d}$. In the sub-critical regime $\gamma&lt;\sqrt{2d}$, we allow the fields to be mildly non-Gaussian, that is, the field has the decomposition $X=G+H$ with a log-correlated Gaussian field $G$ and a H\"older-continuos (not necessarily Gaussian) field $H$.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators for the kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills theory can be understood in the framework of homotopy algebras: the $L_{\infty}$ algebra of Yang-Mills theory is the tensor product of the color Lie algebra and a kinematic space that carries a $C_{\infty}$ algebra. There are also hidden structures that generalize Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, which explain color-kinematics duality and the double copy but are only partially understood. We show that there is a representation of the $C_{\infty}$ algebra, in terms of vertex operators, on the Hilbert space of a first-quantized worldline theory. To this end we introduce $A_{\infty}$ morphisms, which define the vertex operators and which inject the $C_{\infty}$ algebra into the strictly associative algebra of operators on the Hilbert space. We also take first steps to represent the hidden structures on the same space.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>5-D thermal field theory, Einstein field equations and spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown previously, that the spatial thermal variation of a thermal medium can be recast as a variation in the Euclidean metric. It is now extended to temporal variations in temperature, for a non-relativistic thermal bath, which remains in local thermal equilibrium. This is achieved by examining the thermal field theory in a five-dimensional space-time-temperature. The bulk thermodynamic quantity, namely the energy density, is calculated for a neutral scalar field with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the concept of recasting thermal variations as a variation in the metric is extended to thermal systems in a gravitational field. The Einstein field equations, in the 5-D space-time-temperature, is determined. It is shown that the resulting Ricci scalar can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to the Higgs mechanism. In essence, the asymmetry in the distribution of temperature in space-time can translate to spontaneous symmetry breaking of particle fields, in a very strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <title>Is the Born rule a result of measurement noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule asserts the probability distribution of eigenstates observed in unbiased quantum measurements, but the reason it holds remains elusive. This manuscript discusses how the Born rule might be explained by Schrodinger equation dynamics, if a measurement comprises a system responding to random fluctuations until it is within an arbitrarily small tolerance of a measurement eigenstate. We describe the random walk dynamics that produce this behavior in terms of a class of time-dependent, stochastic unitary matrices U(t). We also discuss the class of stochastic potential energies in the Schrodinger equation that is equivalent to this class of unitary matrices.
  This analysis raises some questions worth considering, including how to determine if any measurements actually follow the predicted random walk mechanism and whether a reliable measurement apparatus could be designed that deviates from Born rule probabilities. Interestingly, if any measurements do follow this random walk mechanism, then exposing a quantum system to stochastic 'noise' is an intrinsic part of such a measurement, not merely an unwanted side effect. This characteristic would have implications for reducing noise in quantum sensing and quantum computing.
  This is a draft of a work in progress. Questions and suggestions are welcome.</description>

      <title>Criterion of singularity formation for radial solutions of the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations in exceptional dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>

      <title>Time splitting and error estimates for nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in a quintessence background and the role of GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>
