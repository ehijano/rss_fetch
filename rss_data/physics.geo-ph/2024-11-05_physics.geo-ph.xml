      <title>Addressing out-of-sample issues in multi-layer convolutional neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies applied near coastlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the boundary artifacts in machine-learned (ML) parameterizations for ocean subgrid mesoscale momentum forcing, as identified in the online ML implementation from a previous study (Zhang et al., 2023). We focus on the boundary condition (BC) treatment within the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) models and aim to mitigate the "out-of-sample" errors observed near complex coastal regions without developing new, complex network architectures. Our approach leverages two established strategies for placing BCs in CNN models, namely zero and replicate padding. Offline evaluations revealed that these padding strategies significantly reduce root mean squared error (RMSE) in coastal regions by limiting the dependence on random initialization of weights and restricting the range of out-of-sample predictions. Further online evaluations suggest that replicate padding consistently reduces boundary artifacts across various retrained CNN models. In contrast, zero padding sometimes intensifies artifacts in certain retrained models despite both strategies performing similarly in offline evaluations. This study underscores the need for BC treatments in CNN models trained on open water data when predicting near-coastal subgrid forces in ML parameterizations. The application of replicate padding, in particular, offers a robust strategy to minimize the propagation of extreme values that can contaminate computational models or cause simulations to fail. Our findings provide insights for enhancing the accuracy and stability of ML parameterizations in the online implementation of ocean circulation models with coastlines.</description>

      <title>3D Migration Aperture and Formula Connecting Dips of Prestack Time Migrated and Unmigrated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formula connecting dips of unmigrated 2D and prestack time migrated constant offset gathers was recently proposed (Singh, 2024). A handy formula for 2D prestack migration aperture was also derived. We extend the same work to the 3D case, that is, we derive prestack time migration aperture, and formula connecting dips as a function of dip of a planar reflector and azimuth w.r.t. the dip direction.</description>

      <title>On the effect of two-direction seasonal flows on barchans and the origin of occluded dunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We inquire into the morphodynamics of barchans under seasonal flows. For that, we carried out grain-scale numerical computations of a subaqueous barchan exposed to two-directional flows, and we varied the angle and frequency of oscillations. We show that when the frequency is lower than the inverse of the characteristic time for barchan formation, the dune adapts to the new flow direction and recovers the barchan shape while losing less grains than under one-directional flow. For higher frequencies, the dune has not enough time for adaptation and becomes more round while losing more grains. For both cases, we show, for the first time, the typical dynamics of grains (trajectories and forces). In particular, the round barchans are similar to the so-called occluded dunes observed on Mars, where seasons have very high frequencies compared to the dune timescale, different from Earth. Our results represent a possible explanation for that shape.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Slow Slip Events in New Zealand from two coupled slip patches: a proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that seemingly random Slow Slip Events (SSEs) can display chaotic patterns within the largest source of seismic hazards in New Zealand, the Hikurangi subduction zone. Some irregular SSE occurrences are therefore not arbitrary but behave with short-term predictability. However, the forecasting challenge persists as observations remain too short and noisy to constrain purely data-driven solutions, calling for a physics-based modelling approach. Here we propose a physical model of two coupled oscillators, each capturing the behaviour of a single slow-slip patch, for the deep Kaimanawa and the shallow East Coast SSEs respectively. The simplified model successfully reproduces the type of chaotic behaviour observed at the Global Navigational Satellite System station in Gisborne, yielding SSEs of appropriately varying amplitude and duration. Those results reveal that the multi-physics response of the shear zone strongly controls the underlying system, even before accounting for any geometrical complexity or distribution of material properties.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Rotational Ground Motions: Implications for Earthquake-Resistant Design of Bridge Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquakes cause catastrophic damage to buildings and loss of human life. Civil engineers across the globe design earthquake-resistant buildings to minimize this damage. Conventionally, the structures are designed to resist the translational motions caused by an earthquake. However, with the increasing evidence of rotational ground motions in addition to the translational ground motions due to earthquakes, there is a crucial need to identify if these additional components have an impact on the existing structural design strategies. In this regard, the present study makes a novel attempt to obtain the dynamic properties of a large-scale prototype prestressed reinforced concrete bridge structure using six component (6C) ground motions. The structure is instrumented with conventional translational seismic sensors, rotational sensors and newly developed six-component sensors under operating and externally excited conditions. The recorded data is used to carry out Operational Modal Analysis and Experimental Modal Analysis of the bridge. Modal analysis using the rotational measurements shows that the expected location of maximum rotations on the bridge differs from the maximum translations. Therefore, further understanding the behavior of rotational motions is necessary for developing earthquake-resistant structural design strategies</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Self-Consistency Learning for Seismic Irregular Spatial Sampling Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic exploration is currently the most important method for understanding subsurface structures. However, due to surface conditions, seismic receivers may not be uniformly distributed along the measurement line, making the entire exploration work difficult to carry out. Previous deep learning methods for reconstructing seismic data often relied on additional datasets for training. While some existing methods do not require extra data, they lack constraints on the reconstruction data, leading to unstable reconstruction performance. In this paper, we proposed a zero-shot self-consistency learning strategy and employed an extremely lightweight network for seismic data reconstruction. Our method does not require additional datasets and utilizes the correlations among different parts of the data to design a self-consistency learning loss function, driving a network with only 90,609 learnable parameters. We applied this method to experiments on the USGS National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska public dataset and the results indicate that our proposed approach achieved good reconstruction results. Additionally, our method also demonstrates a certain degree of noise suppression, which is highly beneficial for large and complex seismic exploration tasks.</description>

      <title>Condensation and the Volatility Trend of the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes condensation of the elements and use of condensation temperatures (Tcond) to interpret the volatility trend of the Earth. Major points are: (1) a listing of updated 50% Tcond for all natural elements and Pu at 1e-2 to 1e-8 bar pressure for solar composition matter. (2) The Tcond are mainly controlled by the Gibbs energy of condensation reactions and also by the Gibbs energy of ideal mixing if elements (compounds) condense in a solution. The Gibbs energy change of non-ideal solution (activity coefficients not equal to 1) is a secondary effect. (3) The theoretically correct relationship between Tcond and fraction condensed is derived from mass balance and chemical thermodynamic considerations. (4) The maximum amount of element condensed per 1/T, is at the inflection point in the logistic (sigmoid) curve for an element, which is also at (or close to) the 50% Tcond. (5) Plots of normalized elemental abundances versus 50% Tcond (volatility trends) are qualitative indicators of elemental fractionations due to volatility. (6) Volatility trend plots for average elemental abundances in CM, CO, CV, CR, H, L, LL, EH, EL chondrites show different trends for moderately and highly volatile elements, which may be linear, curved, a step function, or plateau. Comparison of three abundance sets for CM and CV chondrites shows trends depend on which elements are plotted, which data sources are used, and which temperature range is considered. (7) Proposed mechanisms for volatile element depletion in carbonaceous chondrites and the Earth are reviewed. (8) Possible implications of volatile element abundances in the bulk silicate Earth are discussed.</description>

      <title>Earthquakes big and small: same physics, different boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similarity indicates that large and small earthquakes share the same physics, where all variables scale with rupture length $L$. Here I show that rupture tip acceleration during the start of dynamic rupture (break-out phase) is also self-similar, scaling with $L_c$ in space and $L_c/C_{lim}$ in time (where $L_c$ is the breakout patch length and $C_{lim}$ the limiting rupture velocity in the subsonic regime). Rupture acceleration in the breakout phase is slower for larger initial breakout patches $L_c$. Because small faults cannot host large breakout patches, a large and slower initial breakout may be indicative of a potentially large final earthquake magnitude. Initial moment rate $\dot{M}_o$ also grows slower for larger $L_c$, therefore it may reflect fault dimensions and carry a probabilistic forecast of magnitude as suggested in some Early Warning studies. This result does not violate causality and is fully compatible with the shared fundamental, self-similar physics across all the magnitude spectrum.</description>
