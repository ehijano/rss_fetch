      <title>Convergence rate for the coupon collector's problem with Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the classical coupon collector problem with uniform probabilities. Since the seminal paper by P. Erd\"os and A. R\'enyi \cite{ErRe}, it is well-known that the renormalized number of attempts required to complete a collection of $n$ items distributed with uniform probability tends to a Gumbel distribution when $n$ goes to infinity. We propose to determine how fast this convergence takes place for a certain distance to be introduced by using the so-called generator approach of Stein's method. To do so, we introduce a semi-group similar to the classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semi-group and whose stationary measure is the standard Gumbel distribution. We give its essential properties and apply them to prove that the renormalized number of attempts converges to the Gumbel distribution at rate $\log n/n$.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity of invariant measures to SPDEs in Da Prato-Debussche regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an elementary method to show non-Gaussianity of invariant measures of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations with polynomial non-linearities in the Da Prato--Debussche regime. The approach is essentially algebraic and involves using the generator equation of the SPDE at stationarity. Our results in particular cover the $\Phi^4_\delta$ measures in dimensions $\delta&lt;\frac{14}{5}$, which includes cases where the invariant measure is singular with respect to the invariant measure of the linear solution.</description>

      <title>On the speed of coming down from infinity for (sub)critical branching processes with pairwise interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of coming down from infinity for (sub)critical cooperative branching processes with pairwise interactions (BPI processes for short) under appropriate conditions. BPI processes are continuous-time Markov chains that extend pure branching dynamics by incorporating additional mechanisms that allow both competition and cooperation events between pairs of individuals.
  Specifically, we focus on characterising the speed at which BPI processes evolve when starting from a very large initial population in the subcritical and critical cooperative regimes. Further, in the subcritical cooperative regime, we analyse their second-order fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet problem for diffusions with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Dirichlet problem for non-local operator on bounded domains in ${\mathbb R}^d$
  $$
  {\cal L}u = {\rm div}(A(x) \nabla (x)) + b(x) \cdot \nabla u(x)
  + \int_{{\mathbb R}^d} (u(y)-u(x) ) J(x, dy) , $$ where $A(x)=(a_{ij}(x))_{1\leq i,j\leq d}$ is a measurable $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on ${\mathbb R}^d$ that is uniformly elliptic and bounded, $b$ is an ${\mathbb R}^d$-valued function so that $|b|^2$ is in some Kato class ${\mathbb K}_d$, for each $x\in {\mathbb R}^d$, $J(x, dy)$ is a finite measure on ${\mathbb R}^d$ so that $x\mapsto J(x, {\mathbb R}^d)$ is in the Kato class ${\mathbb K}_d$. We show there is a unique Feller process $X$ having strong Feller property associated with ${\cal L}$, which can be obtained from the diffusion process having generator $ {\rm div}(A(x) \nabla (x)) + b(x) \cdot \nabla u(x) $ through redistribution. We further show that for any bounded connected open subset $D\subset{\mathbb R}^d$ that is regular with respect to the Laplace operator $\Delta$ and for any bounded continuous function $\varphi $ on $D^c$, the Dirichlet problem ${\cal L} u=0$ in $D$ with $u=\varphi$ on $D^c$ has a unique bounded continuous weak solution on ${\mathbb R}^d$. This unique weak solution can be represented in terms of the Feller process associated with ${\cal L}$.</description>

      <title>Invariant measure for the process viewed from the particle for 2D random walks in Dirichlet environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks in Dirichlet random environment (RWDE) on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that, if the RWDE is recurrent (which is strongly conjectured when the weights are symmetric), then there does not exist any invariant measure for the process viewed from the particle which is absolutely continuous with respect to the static law of the environment. Besides, if the walk is directional transient and under condition $\mathbf{(T')}$, we prove that there exists such an invariant probability measure if the trapping parameter verifies $\kappa &gt; 1$ or after acceleration of the process by a local function of the environment. This gives strong credit to a conjectural classification of cases of existence or non-existence of the invariant measure for two dimensional RWDE. The proof is based on a new identity, stated on general finite graphs, which is inspired by the representation of the $\star$-VRJP, a non-reversible generalization of the Vertex reinforced Jump Process, in terms of random Schr\"odinger operators. In the case of RWDE on 1D graph, the previous identity entails also a discrete analogue of the Matsumoto-Yor property for Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Modularity of preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity is a graph parameter measuring how clearly the set of graph vertices may be partitioned into subsets of high edge density. It indicates the presence of community structure in the graph. We study its value for a random preferential attachment model $G_n^h$ introduced by Barab\'asi and Albert in 1999. A graph $G_n^h$ is created from some finite starting graph by adding new vertices one by one. A new vertex always connects to $h\geq1$ already existing vertices and those are chosen with probability proportional to their current degrees. We prove that modularity of $G_n^h$ is with high probability upper bounded by a function tending to $0$ with $h$ tending to infinity. This resolves the conjecture of Prokhorenkova, Pralat and Raigorodskii from 2016. As a byproduct we obtain novel concentration results for the volume and the edge density parameters of subsets of $G_n^h$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the fluctuation behaviour of the stochastic point vortex model with common noise. Using the martingale method combined with a localization argument, we prove that the sequence of fluctuation processes converges in distribution to the unique probabilistically strong solution of a linear stochastic evolution equation. In particular, we establish the strong convergence from the stochastic point vortex model with common noise to the conditional McKean Vlasov equation.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time weak approximation of a Black-Scholes model with drift and volatility Markov switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time financial market with an asset whose price is modeled by a linear stochastic differential equation with drift and volatility switching driven by a uniformly ergodic jump Markov process with a countable state space (in fact, this is a Black-Scholes model with Markov switching). We construct a multiplicative scheme of series of discrete-time markets with discrete-time Markov switching. First, we establish that the discrete-time switching Markov chains weakly converge to the limit continuous-time Markov process. Second, having this in hand, we apply conditioning on Markov chains and prove that the discrete-time market models themselves weakly converge to the Black-Scholes model with Markov switching. The convergence is proved under very general assumptions both on the discrete-time net profits and on a generator of a continuous-time Markov switching process.</description>

      <title>Tightness criteria for random compact sets of cadlag paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give tightness criteria for random variables taking values in the space of all compact sets of cadlag real-valued paths, in terms of both the Skorohod J1 and M1 topologies. This extends earlier work motivated by the study of the Brownian web that was concerned only with continuous paths. In the M1 case, we give a natural extension of our tightness criteria which ensures that non-crossing systems of paths have weak limit points that are also non-crossing. This last result is exemplified through a rescaling of heavy tailed Poisson trees and a more general application to weaves.</description>

      <title>Probability Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a formal definition of the concept of probability tree and conduct a detailed and comprehensive study of its fundamental structural properties. In particular, we define what we term an inductive probability measure and prove that such trees can be identified with these measures. Furthermore, we prove that probability trees are completely determined by probability measures on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the tree's body.
  We then explore applications of probability trees in several areas of mathematics, including probability theory, measure theory, and set theory. In the first, we show that the cumulative distribution of finitely many dependent and non-identically distributed Bernouli tests is bounded by the cumulative distribution of some binomial distribution. In the second, we establish a close relationship between probability trees and the real line, showing that Borel, measurable sets, and their measures can be preserved, as well as other combinatorial properties. Finally, in set theory, we establish that the null ideal associated with suitable probability trees is Tukey equivalent to the null ideal on $[0, 1]$. This leads to a new elementary proof of the fact that the null ideal of a free $\sigma$-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is Tukey equivalent with the null ideal of $\mathbb{R}$, which supports that the associated cardinal characteristics remain invariant across the spaces in which they are defined.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes Generated By Monotonically Modulated Stationary Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines Gaussian processes generated by monotonically modulating stationary kernels. An explicit isometry between the original and the modulated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is established, preserving eigenvalues and normalization. The expected number of zeros over the interval $[0,T]$ is shown to be exactly $\sqrt{-\ddot{K}(0)}(\theta(T)-\theta(0))$, where $\ddot{K}(0)$ is the second derivative of the kernel at zero and $\theta$ is the modulating function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviation principle (LDP) of the stationary solutions of stochastic functional differential equations (SFDEs) with infinite delay under small random perturbation. First, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding stationary solutions. Second, by the weak convergence approach, we show the uniform large deviation principle for the solution maps, and then prove the LDP for stationary solutions. Furthermore, we obtain the LDP for invariant measures of SFDEs through the LDP for stationary solutions and the contraction principle.</description>

      <title>Spectral Criteria for the Asymptotics of Local Functionals of Gaussian Fields and Their Application to Nodal Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general criterion for the positivity of the variance of the second chaotic component of local functionals of stationary vector-valued Gaussian fields. This criterion is formulated in terms of the spectral properties of the covariance function, without requiring assumptions of integrability or isotropy. It offers a simple and robust framework for analyzing variance asymptotics in such models. We apply this approach to the study of the nodal volume and the number of critical points of a Gaussian field, proving the positivity of the limiting variance under mild conditions on the covariance function. Additionally, we examine the asymptotics of the particular model of Euclidean random waves, deriving the central limit theorem through an analysis of the second and fourth chaotic components, thereby resolving an open question in large dimensions. As a byproduct, we condense and generalize many existing results on the volume of intersections of random waves, bypassing the need for traditional, intricate variance computations. Our findings shed new light on the second-chaos cancellation phenomenon from a spectral perspective and can be extended to any local, possibly singular, functional of Gaussian fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in physics (e.g., turbulence intermittency) and financial mathematics (e.g., rough volatility), this paper examines a family of integrated stochastic Volterra processes characterized by a small Hurst parameter $H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$. We investigate the impact of kernel approximation on the integrated process by examining the resulting weak error. Our findings quantify this error in terms of the $L^1$ norm of the difference between the two kernels, as well as the $L^1$ norm of the difference of the squares of these kernels. Our analysis is based on a path-dependent Feynman-Kac formula and the associated partial differential equation (PPDE), providing a robust and extendible framework for our analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of the free Jacobi process with equal rank projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free Jacobi process is the radial part of the compression of the free unitary Brownian motion by two free orthogonal projections. In this paper, we determine the characteristic curves of the partial differential equation satisfied by its spectral distribution when both projections have the same rank $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Doing so leads for any fixed time $t &gt;0$ to an expression of the moment generating function in a neighborhood of the origin, extending our previous results valid for $\alpha = 1/2$. Moreover, the obtained characteristic curves are encoded by an $\alpha$-deformation of the $\xi$-transform of the spectral distribution of the free unitary Brownian motion, of which we study mapping properties. We also prove a dynamical version of a recent identity pointed out by T. Kunisky and relating the stationary distributions of the free Jacobi processes corresponding to the set of parameters $(\alpha, \alpha)$ and $(1/2,\alpha)$. Actually, our dynamical version relates the Cauchy-Stieltjes transforms of the densities of the finite time spectral distributions.</description>

      <title>Linear Algebraic Truncation Algorithm with A Posteriori Error Bounds for Computing Markov Chain Equilibrium Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical computation of equilibrium reward gradients for Markov chains appears in many applications for example within the policy improvement step arising in connection with average reward stochastic dynamic programming. When the state space is large or infinite, one will typically need to truncate the state space in order to arrive at a numerically tractable formulation. In this paper, we derive the first computable a posteriori error bounds for equilibrium reward gradients that account for the error induced by the truncation. Our approach uses regeneration to express equilibrium quantities in terms of the expectations of cumulative rewards over regenerative cycles. Lyapunov functions are then used to bound the contributions to these cumulative rewards and their gradients from path excursions that take the chain outside the truncation set. Our numerical results indicate that our approach can provide highly accurate bounds with truncation sets of moderate size. We further extend our approach to Markov jump processes.</description>

      <title>Strong Low Degree Hardness for Stable Local Optima in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief in the theory of spin glasses and disordered systems that out-of-equilibrium dynamics fail to find stable local optima exhibiting e.g. local strict convexity on physical time-scales. In the context of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass, Behrens-Arpino-Kivva-Zdeborov\'a and Minzer-Sah-Sawhney have recently conjectured that this obstruction may be inherent to all efficient algorithms, despite the existence of exponentially many such optima throughout the landscape. We prove this search problem exhibits strong low degree hardness for polynomial algorithms of degree $D\leq o(N)$: any such algorithm has probability $o(1)$ to output a stable local optimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to prove that even constant-degree polynomials have probability $o(1)$ to solve a random search problem without planted structure. To prove this, we develop a general-purpose enhancement of the ensemble overlap gap property, and as a byproduct improve previous results on spin glass optimization, maximum independent set, random $k$-SAT, and the Ising perceptron to strong low degree hardness. Finally for spherical spin glasses with no external field, we prove that Langevin dynamics does not find stable local optima within dimension-free time.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic simulation of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes and its application to the Morris-Lecar model of neural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise-deterministic Markov processes combine continuous in time dynamics with jump events, the rates of which generally depend on the continuous variables and thus are not constants. This leads to a problem in a Monte-Carlo simulation of such a system, where, at each step, one must find the time instant of the next event. The latter is determined by an integral equation and usually is rather slow in numerical implementation. We suggest a reformulation of the next event problem as an ordinary differential equation where the independent variable is not the time but the cumulative rate. This reformulation is similar to the H\'enon approach to efficiently constructing the Poincar\'e map in deterministic dynamics. The problem is then reduced to a standard numerical task of solving a system of ordinary differential equations with given initial conditions on a prescribed interval. We illustrate the method with a stochastic Morris-Lecar model of neuron spiking with stochasticity in the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels.</description>

      <title>Pathwise guessing in categorical time series with unbounded alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06547v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following learning problem arises naturally in various applications: Given a finite sample from a categorical or count time series, can we learn a function of the sample that (nearly) maximizes the probability of correctly guessing the values of a given portion of the data using the values from the remaining parts? Unlike the classical task of estimating conditional probabilities in a stochastic process, our approach avoids explicitly estimating these probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate that is independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count process, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the rate of convergence of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behavior of the quantum Ising susceptibility and a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is widely studied as one of the simplest quantum spin systems. It is known that this model exhibits a phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)$, where $q$ is the strength of the transverse field. Bj\"ornberg [Commun. Math. Phys., 232 (2013)] investigated the divergence rate of the susceptibility for the nearest-neighbor model as the critical point is approached by simultaneously changing $q$ and the spin-spin coupling $J$ in a proper manner, with fixed temperature. In this paper, we prove that the susceptibility diverges as $(\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)-\beta)^{-1}$ as $\beta\uparrow\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)$ for $d&gt;4$ assuming an infrared bound on the space-time two-point function. One of the key elements is a stochastic-geometric representation in Bj\"ornberg &amp; Grimmett [J. Stat. Phys., 136 (2009)] and Crawford &amp; Ioffe [Commun. Math. Phys., 296 (2010)]. As a byproduct, we derive a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model (i.e., $q=0$).</description>

      <title>Sequential Portfolio Selection under Latent Side Information-Dependence Structure: Optimality and Universal Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the investment problem of constructing an optimal no-short sequential portfolio strategy in a market with a latent dependence structure between asset prices and partly unobservable side information, which is often high-dimensional. The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy, which forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure and full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely often than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time. Specifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence structure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic strategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information, almost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically converging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.
  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy only attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the market process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the dynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary market with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy almost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy does not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio construction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side information from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic growth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bourgain's slicing conjecture was recently resolved by Joseph Lehec and Bo'az Klartag. We present an alternative proof by establishing small ball probability estimates for isotropic log-concave measures. Our approach relies on the stochastic localization process and Guan's bound, techniques also used by Klartag and Lehec. The link between small ball probabilities and the slicing conjecture was first observed by Dafnis and Paouris and is established through Milman's theory of M-ellipsoids.</description>

Abstract: We present a stable characterization of on-diagonal upper bounds for heat kernels associated with regular Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces satisfying the volume doubling property. Our conditions include integral bounds on the jump kernel outside metric balls, a variant of the Faber-Krahn inequality, a cutoff Sobolev inequality, and an integral control of inverse square volumes of balls with respect to the jump kernel. Crucially, we do not assume that the jump kernel has a density, and we show that these assumptions are essentially optimal.</description>

It is shown that, unlike the best-possible bounds on the set of copulas with a given value of other known measures such as Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho or Blomqvist's beta, the bounds found are not necessarily copulas, but proper quasi-copulas.</description>

      <title>Monotone Curve Estimation via Convex Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06975v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A principal curve serves as a powerful tool for uncovering underlying structures of data through 1-dimensional smooth and continuous representations. On the basis of optimal transport theories, this paper introduces a novel principal curve framework constrained by monotonicity with rigorous theoretical justifications. We establish statistical guarantees for our monotone curve estimate, including expected empirical and generalized mean squared errors, while proving the existence of such estimates. These statistical foundations justify adopting the popular early stopping procedure in machine learning to implement our numeric algorithm with neural networks. Comprehensive simulation studies reveal that the proposed monotone curve estimate outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy when the data exhibits a monotonic structure. Moreover, through two real-world applications on future prices of copper, gold, and silver, and avocado prices and sales volume, we underline the robustness of our curve estimate against variable transformation, further confirming its effective applicability for noisy and complex data sets. We believe that this monotone curve-fitting framework offers significant potential for numerous applications where monotonic relationships are intrinsic or need to be imposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of a stochastic SAIRS-type epidemic model that explicitly incorporates the roles of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in disease transmission dynamics. Asymptomatic carriers, often undetected due to the lack of symptoms, play a crucial role in the spread of many communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Our model also accounts for vaccination and considers the stochastic effects of environmental and population-level randomness using L\'evy processes. We begin by demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the proposed stochastic system, ensuring the model's mathematical validity. Subsequently, we derive sufficient conditions under which the disease either becomes extinct or persists over time, depending on the parameters and initial conditions. The analysis highlights the influence of random perturbations, asymptomatic transmission, and vaccination strategies on disease dynamics. Finally, we conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings and illustrate the behavior of the model under various scenarios of randomness and parameter settings. These results provide valuable insights into the stochastic dynamics of epidemic outbreaks and inform strategies for disease management and control.</description>

      <title>Quality Control of Lifetime Drift in Discrete Electrical Parameters in Semiconductor Devices via Transition Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductors are widely used in various applications and critical infrastructures. These devices have specified lifetimes and quality targets that manufacturers must achieve. Lifetime estimation is conducted through accelerated stress tests. Electrical parameters are measured at multiple times during a stress test procedure. The change in these Electrical parameters is called lifetime drift. Data from these tests can be used to develop a statistical model predicting the lifetime behavior of the electrical parameters in real devices. These models can provide early warnings in production processes, identify critical parameter drift, and detect outliers. While models for continuous electrical parameters exists, there may be bias when estimating the lifetime of discrete parameters. To address this, we propose a semi-parametric model for degradation trajectories based on longitudinal stress test data. This model optimizes guard bands, or quality guaranteeing tighter limits, for discrete electrical parameters at production testing. It is scalable, data-driven, and explainable, offering improvements over existing methods for continuous underlying data, such as faster calculations, arbitrary non-parametric conditional distribution modeling, and a natural extension of optimization algorithms to the discrete case using Markov transition matrices.</description>

Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Coulomb gases on the Riemann sphere with determinantal or Pfaffian structures, under external potentials that are invariant under rotations around the axis connecting the north and south poles, and with microscopic point charges inserted at the poles. These models can be interpreted as Coulomb gases on the complex plane with weakly confining potentials, where the associated droplet is the entire complex plane. For these models, we derive precise asymptotic expansions of the free energies, including the constant terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularity properties of the minimisers of entropic optimal transport providing a natural analogue of the $\varepsilon$-regularity theory of quadratic optimal transport in the entropic setting. More precisely, we show that if the minimiser of the entropic problem satisfies a gradient BMO-type estimate at some scale, the same estimate holds all the way down to the natural length-scale associated to the entropic regularisation.
  Our result follows from a more general $\varepsilon$-regularity theory for optimal transport costs which can be viewed as perturbations of quadratic optimal transport. We consider such a perturbed cost and require that, under a certain class of admissible affine rescalings, the minimiser remains a local quasi-minimiser of the quadratic problem (in an appropriate sense) and that the cost of "long trajectories" of minimisers (and their rescalings) is small. Under these assumptions, we show that the minimiser satisfies an appropriate $C^{2,\alpha}$ Morrey$\unicode{x2013}$Campanato-type estimate which is valid up to the scale of quasi-minimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Even Subgraph and Its Connection to Phase Transitions of Graphical Representations of the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform even subgraph is intimately related to the Ising model, the random-cluster model, the random current model and the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model. In this paper, we first prove that the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ using its characterisation as the Haar measure on the group of even graphs. We then tighten the result by showing that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ for edge-weights $x$ lying in some interval $(1-\varepsilon,1]$. Finally, our main theorem is that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model and random current models corresponding to a supercritical Ising model are always at least critical, in the sense that their two-point correlation functions decay at most polynomially and the expected cluster sizes are infinite.</description>

      <title>A non-inertial model for particle aggregation under turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an abstract non-inertial model of aggregation under the influence of a Gaussian white noise with prescribed space-covariance, and prove a formula for the mean collision rate $R$, per unit of time and volume. Specializing the abstract theory to a non-inertial model obtained by an inertial one, with physical constants, in the limit of infinitesimal relaxation time of the particles, and the white noise obtained as an approximation of a Gaussian noise with correlation time $\tau_{\eta}$, up to approximations the formula reads $R\sim\tau_{\eta}\left\langle \left\vert \Delta_{a}u\right\vert ^{2}\right\rangle a\cdot n^{2}$ where $n$ is the particle number per unit of volume and $\left\langle \left\vert \Delta _{a}u\right\vert ^{2}\right\rangle $ is the square-average of the increment of random velocity field $u$ between points at distance $a$, the particle radius. If we choose the Kolmogorov time scale $\tau_{\eta}\sim\left( \frac{\nu }{\varepsilon}\right) ^{1/2}$ and we assume that $a$ is in the dissipative range where $\left\langle \left\vert \Delta_{a}u\right\vert ^{2}\right\rangle \sim\left( \frac{\varepsilon}{\nu}\right) a^{2}$, we get Saffman-Turner formula for the collision rate $R$.</description>

      <title>From Letters to Words and Back: Invertible Coding of Stationary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems of statistical language modeling, we consider probability measures on infinite sequences over two countable alphabets of a different cardinality, such as letters and words. We introduce an invertible mapping between such measures, called the normalized transport, that preserves both stationarity and ergodicity. The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes and specialize bijective stationary codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport and self-avoiding codes arise in the problem of successive recurrence times. We show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which strengthens a result by Chen Moy from 1959. We also relate the entropy rates of processes linked by the normalized transport.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13111v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a distributionally robust optimization formulation (i.e., a min-max game) for two representative problems in Bayesian nonparametric estimation: Gaussian process regression and, more generally, linear inverse problems. Our formulation seeks the best mean-squared error predictor, in an infinite-dimensional space, against an adversary who chooses the worst-case model in a Wasserstein ball around a nominal infinite-dimensional Bayesian model. The transport cost is chosen to control features such as the degree of roughness of the sample paths that the adversary is allowed to inject. We show that the game has a well-defined value (i.e., strong duality holds in the sense that max-min equals min-max) and that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium which can be computed by a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations. Crucially, the worst-case distribution is itself Gaussian. We explore properties of the Nash equilibrium and the effects of hyperparameters through a set of numerical experiments, demonstrating the versatility of our modeling framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the forward-backward system of stochastic partial differential equations describing a mean field game for a large population of small players subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. The unique feature of the problem is that the idiosyncratic noise coefficient may be degenerate, so that the system does not admit smooth solutions in general. We develop a new notion of weak solutions for backward stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and use this to build probabilistically weak solutions of the mean field game system.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for the posterior in exponential families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain quantitative, non-asymptotic, and data-dependent \textit{Bernstein-von Mises type} bounds on the normal approximation of the posterior distribution in exponential family models with arbitrary centring and scaling. Our bounds, stated in the total variation and Wasserstein distances, are valid for univariate and multivariate posteriors alike, and do not require a conjugate prior setting. They are obtained through a refined version of Stein's method of comparison of operators that allows for improved dimensional dependence in high-dimensional settings and may also be of interest in other problems. Our approach is rather flexible and, in certain settings, allows for the derivation of bounds with rates of convergence faster than the usual \( O(n^{-1/2}) \) rate (when \( n \) is the sample size). We illustrate our findings on a variety of exponential family distributions, including the Weibull, multinomial, and linear regression with unknown variance. The resulting bounds have an explicit dependence on the prior distribution and on sufficient statistics of the data from the sample, and thus provide insight into how these factors affect the quality of the normal approximation. Insights from our examples include identification of conditions under which faster \( O(n^{-1}) \) convergence rates occur for Bernoulli data, illustrations of how the quality of the normal approximation is influenced by the choice of standardisation, and dimensional dependence in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for Grothendieck constants, quantum correlation matrices and CCP functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the search for the still unknown exact value of the real and complex Grothendieck constant $K_G^\mathbb{F}$ in the famous Grothendieck inequality (unsolved since 1953), where $\mathbb{F}$ denotes either the real or the complex field, we concentrate our search on their smallest upper bound. To this end, we establish a basic framework, built on functions which map correlation matrices to correlation matrices entrywise by means of the Hadamard product, such as the Krivine function in the real case or the Haagerup function in the complex case. By making use of multivariate real and complex Gaussian analysis, higher transcendental functions, integration over spheres and combinatorics of the inversion of Maclaurin series, we provide an approach by which we also recover all famous upper bounds of Grothendieck himself ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \sinh(\pi/2) \approx 2.301$), Krivine ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})} \approx 1,782$) and Haagerup ($K_G^\mathbb{C} \leq 1.405$, numerically approximated); each of them as a special case. In doing so, we aim to unify the real and complex case as much as possible and apply our results to several concrete examples, including the Walsh-Hadamard transform (''quantum gate'') and the multivariate Gaussian copula - with foundations of quantum theory and quantum information theory in mind. Moreover, we offer a shortening and a simplification of the proof of the strongest estimation until now; namely that $K_G^\mathbb{R} &lt; \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})}$. We summarise our key results in form of an algorithmic scheme and shed light on related open problems and topics for future research.</description>

      <title>Pricing of geometric Asian options in the Volterra-Heston model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15828v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric Asian options are a type of options where the payoff depends on the geometric mean of the underlying asset over a certain period of time. This paper is concerned with the pricing of such options for the class of Volterra-Heston models, covering the rough Heston model. We are able to derive semi-closed formulas for the prices of geometric Asian options with fixed and floating strikes for this class of stochastic volatility models. These formulas require the explicit calculation of the conditional joint Fourier transform of the logarithm of the stock price and the logarithm of the geometric mean of the stock price over time. Linking our problem to the theory of affine Volterra processes, we find a representation of this Fourier transform as a suitably constructed stochastic exponential, which depends on the solution of a Riccati-Volterra equation. Finally we provide a numerical study for our results in the rough Heston model.</description>

Abstract: Besov spaces with dominating mixed smoothness, on the product of the real line and the torus as well as bounded domains, are studied. A characterization of these function spaces in terms of differences is provided. Applications to random fields, like Gaussian fields and the stochastic heat equation, are discussed, based on a Kolmogorov criterion for Besov regularity with dominating mixed smoothness.</description>

      <title>Improved weak convergence for the long time simulation of Mean-field Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weak convergence behaviour of the Leimkuhler--Matthews method, a non-Markovian Euler-type scheme with the same computational cost as the Euler scheme, for the approximation of the stationary distribution of a one-dimensional McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE). The particular class under study is known as mean-field (overdamped) Langevin equations (MFL). We provide weak and strong error results for the scheme in both finite and infinite time. We work under a strong convexity assumption.
  Based on a careful analysis of the variation processes and the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system associated with the MV-SDE, we show that the method attains a higher-order approximation accuracy in the long-time limit (of weak order convergence rate $3/2$) than the standard Euler method (of weak order $1$). While we use an interacting particle system (IPS) to approximate the MV-SDE, we show the convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the IPS and this includes establishing uniform-in-time decay estimates for moments of the IPS, the Kolmogorov backward equation and their derivatives. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <title>Fitting the seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable distribution to the financial data</title>

Abstract: The paper proposes and implements a methodology to fit a seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution to financial data. The nonexistence of the mathematical expression of the GTS probability density function makes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) inadequate for providing parameter estimations. Based on the function characteristic and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), we provide a comprehensive approach to circumvent the problem and yield a good parameter estimation of the GTS probability. The methodology was applied to fit two heavily tailed data (Bitcoin and Ethereum returns) and two peaked data (S\&amp;P 500 and SPY ETF returns). For each index, the estimation results show that the six-parameter estimations are statistically significant except for the local parameter, $\mu$. The goodness-of-fit was assessed through Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and Pearson's chi-squared statistics. While the two-parameter geometric Brownian motion (GBM) hypothesis is always rejected, the GTS distribution fits significantly with a very high p-value; and outperforms the Kobol, Carr-Geman-Madan-Yor, and Bilateral Gamma distributions.</description>

      <title>Erlang Model for Multi-type Data Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of information technology, requirements for data flow have become diverse. When multi-type data flow (MDF) is used, games, videos, calls, \textit{etc.} are all requirements. There may be a constant switch between these requirements, and also multiple requirements at the same time. Therefore, the demands of users change over time, which makes traditional teletraffic analysis not directly applicable. This paper proposes probabilistic models for the requirement of MDF, and analyzes in three states: non-tolerance, tolerance and delay. When the requirement random variables are co-distributed with respect to time, we prove the practicability of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) from a mathematical perspective by discretizing time and error analysis. An algorithm of pre-allocating resources is given to guild the construction of base resources.</description>
