      <title>EMSpice 2.1: A Coupled EM and IR Drop Analysis Tool with Joule Heating and Thermal Map Integration for VLSI Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromigration (EM) remains a critical reliability concern in current and future copper-based VLSI circuits. As technology scales down, EM-induced IR drop becomes increasingly severe. While several EM-aware IR drop analysis tools have been proposed, few incorporate the real impact of temperature distribution on both EM and IR drop effects. In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an enhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice 2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely integrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual chip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with commercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off analysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly impact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM failures. Furthermore, our tool exhibits strong agreement with industry-standard tools such as COMSOL, achieving a speedup of over 200 times while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Iteratively Saturated Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) provides optimal recursive state estimates for linear-Gaussian systems and underpins applications in control, signal processing, and others. However, it is vulnerable to outliers in the measurements and process noise. We introduce the iteratively saturated Kalman filter (ISKF), which is derived as a scaled gradient method for solving a convex robust estimation problem. It achieves outlier robustness while preserving the KF's low per-step cost and implementation simplicity, since in practice it typically requires only one or two iterations to achieve good performance. The ISKF also admits a steady-state variant that, like the standard steady-state KF, does not require linear system solves in each time step, making it well-suited for real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.</description>

      <title>Minimal Construction of Graphs with Maximum Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of network $r$-robustness and $(r,s)$-robustness have been earlier introduced in the literature to achieve resilient control in the presence of misbehaving agents. However, while higher robustness levels provide networks with higher tolerances against the misbehaving agents, they also require dense communication structures, which are not always desirable for systems with limited capabilities and energy capacities. Therefore, this paper studies the fundamental structures behind $r$-robustness and $(r,s)$- robustness properties in two different ways. (a) We first explore and establish the tight necessary conditions on the number of edges for undirected graphs with any nodes must satisfy to achieve maximum $r$- and $(r,s)$-robustness. (b) We then use these conditions to construct two classes of undirected graphs, referred as to $\gamma$- and $(\gamma,\gamma)$-Minimal Edge Robust Graphs (MERGs), that provably achieve maximum robustness with minimal numbers of edges. We finally validate our work through some sets of simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Coordination under Poisson Observations: A Global Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of strategic coordination based on a class of games with incomplete information known as Global Games. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed signals and a Gamma prior distribution on state of the system, we demonstrate the existence of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium within the class of threshold policies for utility functions that are linear in the agents' actions. Although computing the exact threshold that constitutes an equilibrium in a system with finitely many agents is a highly non-trivial task, the problem becomes tractable by analyzing the game's potential function with countably infinitely many agents. Through numerical examples, we provide evidence that the resulting potential function is unimodal, exhibiting a well-defined maximum. Our results are applicable to the modeling of bacterial Quorum Sensing systems, whose noisy observation signals are often well-approximated using Poisson processes.</description>

      <title>The impact of the following vehicles behaviors on the car following behaviors of the ego-vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all types of crashes, rear-end crashes dominate, which are closely related to the car-following (CF) behaviors. Traditional CF behavior models focused on the influence of the vehicle in front, but usually ignored the peer pressure from the surrounding road users, including the following vehicle (FV). Based on an open dataset, the highD dataset, we investigated whether the FV's states can affect the CF behavior of the ego-vehicle in CF events. Two types of CF events were extracted from highD database, including the tailgated events, where the time headway between the FV and the ego-vehicle (i.e., time gap) was smaller than 1 second, and the gapped events, where the time gap was larger than 3 seconds. The dynamic time warping was used to extract CF pairs with similar speed profiles of the leading vehicle (LV). Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the CF-performance metrics in tailgated and gapped events. Then, the inverse reinforcement learning was used to recover the reward function of the ego-vehicle drivers in different CF events. The results showed that the ego-driver would adjust their CF behavior in response to the pressure from a tailgating FV, by maintaining a closer distance to the LV, but at the same time, driving more cautiously. Further, drivers were still able to adjust their CF strategies based on the speed of traffic flow and the distance to the LV, even when being tailgated. These findings provide insights regarding more accurate modelling of traffic flow by considering the peer pressure from surrounding road users.</description>

      <title>Price Aware Power Split Control in Heterogeneous Battery Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the optimal scheduling of battery dispatch and internal power allocation in Battery energy storage systems (BESS). This novel approach integrates both market-based (price-aware) signals and physical system constraints to simultaneously optimize (1) external energy dispatch and (2) internal heterogeneity management of BESS, enhancing its operational economic value and performance. This work compares both model-based Linear Programming (LP) and model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for optimization under varying forecast assumptions, using a custom Gym-based simulation environment. The evaluation considers both long-term and short-term performance, focusing on economic savings, State of Charge (SOC) and temperature balancing, and overall system efficiency. In summary, the long-term results show that the RL approach achieved 10% higher system efficiency compared to LP, whereas the latter yielded 33% greater cumulative savings. In terms of internal heterogeneity, the LP approach resulted in lower mean SOC imbalance, while the RL approach achieved better temperature balance between strings. This behavior is further examined in the short-term evaluation, which indicates that LP delivers strong optimization under known and stable conditions, whereas RL demonstrates higher adaptability in dynamic environments, offering potential advantages for real-time BESS control.</description>

      <title>Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative (worst-case) assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Natural Language to Linear Temporal Logic Translation: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubascudes/vltl bench.</description>

      <title>Constellation as a Service: Tailored Connectivity Management in Direct-Satellite-to-Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments.</description>

      <title>Geometrization of Higher-Order Linear Control Laws for Attitude Control on $\mathsf{SO(3)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the stability of higher-order geometric nonlinear control laws for attitude control on the Special Orthogonal Group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. In particular, the paper extends existing results on the analysis of PID-type geometric nonlinear control laws to more general higher-order dynamic state-feedback compensators on $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. The candidate Lyapunov function is motivated by quadratic Lyapunov functions of the form $V(x)=x^{\top}Px$ typically considered in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The stability analysis is carried out in two steps. In the first step, a sufficient condition is obtained for the positive definiteness of the candidate Lyapunov function, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the negative definiteness of the corresponding Lyapunov rate. These conditions ensure that the desired equilibrium is almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS). In the second step, a convex relaxation of the proposed conditions is used to obtain sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Overall, the approach is motivated by the widespread use of LMI-based analysis and design tools for LTI systems. To reduce conservatism, matrix gains are considered for the controller gains as well as the Lyapunov function coefficients. The applicability of the approach to practical problems is illustrated by designing and analyzing a 21-state geometric nonlinear attitude control law for a multicopter.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Car-Following Models with Bike Dynamics for Improved Traffic Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road traffic simulations are crucial for establishing safe and efficient traffic environments. They are used to test various road applications before real-world implementation. SUMO is a well-known simulator for road networks and intermodal traffic, often used in conjunction with other tools to test various types of applications. Realistic simulations require accurate movement models for different road users, such as cars, bicycles, and buses. While realistic models are already implemented for most vehicle types, bicycles, which are essential for achieving safe and efficient traffic, can only be modeled as slow vehicles or fast pedestrians at present. This paper introduces the Realistic Bicycle Dynamics Model (RBDM), the first dedicated bicycle model for SUMO, addressing this significant gap. Leveraging real-world bicycle data from the SimRa dataset, the RBDM implements realistic speed, acceleration, and deceleration behaviors of bicycles in urban scenarios. The evaluation is conducted using the Monaco SUMO traffic scenario and a newly generated Berlin scenario in SUMO. The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle approximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These results underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for accurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement profiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested for its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies, which is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa data were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could be adapted for use in different city topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalog maintenance of space objects by limited number of ground-based sensors presents a formidable challenging task to the space community. This article presents a methodology for time-invariant tracking and surveillance of space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by optimally directing ground sensors. Our methodology aims to maximize the expected number of space objects from a set of ground stations by utilizing concepts from stochastic geometry, particularly the Poisson point process. We have provided a systematic framework to understand visibility patterns and enhance the efficiency of tracking multiple objects simultaneously. Our approach contributes to more informed decision-making in space operations, ultimately supporting efforts to maintain safety and sustainability in LEO.</description>

      <title>Observation of Blood Flow in Major Neck Vessels Modulated 1 by Physiological Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large neck vessels (carotid artery and internal jugular vein, IJV) offer a unique opportunity to monitor hemodynamics non-invasively by optical means. The primary shortcoming of past work has been the focus on healthy volunteers in normal physiological conditions and well-controlled environments. To drive the technology closer to the bedside, testing is required under more re-alistic conditions, including in pathologies and real-world environments (e.g., similar toICU or emergency care settings). The primary goal of the current work was to extend the range of physiological maneuvers for blood flow modulation by introducing new maneuvers and ob-serving PPG response to them. The data from the necks of two healthy volunteers in a supine position were collected by clinical PPG and in-house built PPG sensors, accompanied by ECG signal collection. Seven maneuvers (abdominojugular test, breath holding, Valsalva, proximal occlusion of right IJV, distal occlusion of right IJV, proximal occlusion of left IJV, distal occlusion of left IJV) were performed in sequence with 1 min allocated for each maneuver. The 1 min was split into three segments: baseline (15 s), experiment (15 s), and recovery (30 s). Thus, the overall du-ration of the experiment was 7 min. AC amplitude from clinical PPG, DC amplitudes from in-house built PPG, and ECG signal were compared during all seven physiological maneuvers. Newly proposed maneuvers (Valsalva and IJV occlusions) demonstrated modulation of blood flow, which was more significant than previously reported maneuvers (abdominojugular test and breath holding). The proposed physiological maneuvers demonstrate high potential as instruments for modulating blood flow in major neck vessels.</description>

      <title>Robustness Analysis for Quantum Systems Controlled by Continuous-Time Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs</description>

      <title>Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Artificially Intelligent Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome, explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness, ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties. Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for control-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Cyber Attacks Detection, Prevention, and Source Localization in Digital Substation Communication using Hybrid Statistical-Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</description>

      <title>Neural Augmented Kalman Filters for Road Network assisted GNSS positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29% decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine the user position on Earth.</description>

      <title>A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides. Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based approach to certifying stability in control theory.</description>

      <title>Ranking Quantilized Mean-Field Games with an Application to Early-Stage Venture Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantilized mean-field game models involve quantiles of the population's distribution. We study a class of such games with a capacity for ranking games, where the performance of each agent is evaluated based on its terminal state relative to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This evaluation criterion is designed to select the top $(1-\alpha)\%$ performing agents. We provide two formulations for this competition: a target-based formulation and a threshold-based formulation. In the former and latter formulations, to satisfy the selection condition, each agent aims for its terminal state to be \textit{exactly} equal and \textit{at least} equal to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, respectively.
  For the target-based formulation, we obtain an analytic solution and demonstrate the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the asymptotic best-response strategies in the $N$-player game. Specifically, the quantilized mean-field consistency condition is expressed as a set of forward-backward ordinary differential equations, characterizing the $\alpha$-quantile value at equilibrium. For the threshold-based formulation, we obtain a semi-explicit solution and numerically solve the resulting quantilized mean-field consistency condition.
  Subsequently, we propose a new application in the context of early-stage venture investments, where a venture capital firm financially supports a group of start-up companies engaged in a competition over a finite time horizon, with the goal of selecting a percentage of top-ranking ones to receive the next round of funding at the end of the time horizon. We present the results and interpretations of numerical experiments for both formulations discussed in this context and show that the target-based formulation provides a very good approximation for the threshold-based formulation.</description>

      <title>Turning AI Data Centers into Grid-Interactive Assets: Results from a Field Demonstration in Phoenix, Arizona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling exponential electricity demand growth, threatening grid reliability, raising prices for communities paying for new energy infrastructure, and stunting AI innovation as data centers wait for interconnection to constrained grids. This paper presents the first field demonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a software-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into flexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing power systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU cluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale cloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on real-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this platform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid reliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Modified RISE Control for Quadrotors: Enhancing Trajectory Tracking Through Uncertainty Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive modified Robust Inverse of Signum Error (AM-RISE) control method, which achieves reliable trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.</description>

      <title>Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study N-player finite games with costs perturbed due to time-varying disturbances in the underlying system and to that end, we propose the concept of Robust Correlated Equilibrium that generalizes the definition of Correlated Equilibrium. Conditions under which the Robust Correlated Equilibrium exists are specified, and a decentralized algorithm for learning strategies that are optimal in the sense of Robust Correlated Equilibrium is proposed. The primary contribution of the paper is the convergence analysis of the algorithm and to that end, we propose a modification of the celebrated Blackwell's Approachability theorem to games with costs that are not just time-average, as in the original Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, but also include the time-average of previous algorithm iterates. The designed algorithm is applied to a practical water distribution network with pumps being the controllers and their costs being perturbed by uncertain consumption due to the consumers. Simulation results show that each controller achieves no regret, and empirical distributions converge to the Robust Correlated Equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Th\'evenin Equivalent Parameters Identification Based on Statistical Characteristics of System Ambient Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for identifying Th\'evenin equivalent parameters (TEP) in power system, based on the statistical characteristics of the system's stochastic response. The method leverages stochastic fluctuation data under steady-state grid conditions and applies sliding window techniques to compute sensitivity parameters between voltage magnitude, current magnitude and power. This enables high-accuracy and robust TEP identification. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on large disturbances or probing signals but instead utilizes the natural fluctuation behavior of the system. Additionally, the method supports distributed implementation using local measurements of voltage magnitude, current magnitude, and power, offering significant practical value for engineering applications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the method's robustness in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), asynchronous measurements, and data collinearity issues. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in diverse practical scenarios, demonstrating its ability to consistently provide accurate and reliable identification of TEP using system ambient data.</description>

Among MPC variants, Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This paper introduces a Disturbance-Adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework that ensures asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds without knowing the uncertainty and noise distributions. The framework employs a data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity BOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC successfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined bounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved 30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across four cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sliding-Mode Control of Grid-Forming Inverters With Precision Region Under AC and DC Sides Varying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage regulation under conventional grid-forming controllers is tightly coupled to power sharing and dc-link dynamics. Consequently, its tracking accuracy deteriorates during grid faults, sudden power sharing changes, or dc-bus voltage varying. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its voltage precision region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when an abnormal entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, an asymmetry compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates voltage tracking error. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these variations separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage precision region is explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.</description>

      <title>On the Cost of Consecutive Estimation Error: Significance-Aware Non-linear Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade between estimation quality and communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures two semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error and the cost of consecutive error. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural properties and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Bone Micro-Milling System with Automatic Calibration and 3D Surface Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel pre-measurement pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time, and accurately perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness, thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7% and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.</description>

      <title>Bregman Centroid Guided Cross-Entropy Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.</description>
