      <title>The entropy corrected geometric Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is widely employed for modeling stochastic processes, yet its solutions are characterized by the log-normal distribution. This comprises predictive capabilities of GBM mainly in terms of forecasting applications. Here, entropy corrections to GBM are proposed to go beyond log-normality restrictions and better account for intricacies of real systems. It is shown that GBM solutions can be effectively refined by arguing that entropy is reduced when deterministic content of considered data increases. Notable improvements over conventional GBM are observed for several cases of non-log-normal distributions, ranging from a dice roll experiment to real world data.</description>

      <title>HiRA-Pro: High resolution alignment of multimodal spatio-temporal data: a process physics driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-$\alpha$: The first cross-task foundation model for particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are multi-dataset and multi-task machine learning methods that once pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a large variety of downstream applications. The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data.
  We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Response Patterns of Network Dynamics -- an Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked dynamical systems, i.e., systems of dynamical units coupled via nontrivial interaction topologies, constitute models of broad classes of complex systems, ranging from gene regulatory and metabolic circuits in our cells to pandemics spreading across continents. Most of such systems are driven by irregular and distributed fluctuating input signals from the environment. Yet how networked dynamical systems collectively respond to such fluctuations depends on the location and type of driving signal, the interaction topology and several other factors and remains largely unknown to date. As a key example, modern electric power grids are undergoing a rapid and systematic transformation towards more sustainable systems, signified by high penetrations of renewable energy sources. These in turn introduce significant fluctuations in power input and thereby pose immediate challenges to the stable operation of power grid systems. How power grid systems dynamically respond to fluctuating power feed-in as well as other temporal changes is critical for ensuring a reliable operation of power grids yet not well understood. In this work, we systematically introduce a linear response theory for fluctuation-driven networked dynamical systems. The derivations presented not only provide approximate analytical descriptions of the dynamical responses of networks, but more importantly, allows to extract key qualitative features about spatio-temporally distributed response patterns. Specifically, we provide a general formulation of a linear response theory for perturbed networked dynamical systems, explicate how dynamic network response patterns arise from the solution of the linearized response dynamics, and emphasize the role of linear response theory in predicting and comprehending power grid responses on different temporal and spatial scales and to various types of disturbances.</description>

      <title>HINORA, a method for detecting ring-like structures in 3D point distributions I: application to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method - called HINORA (HIgh-NOise RANdom SAmple Consensus) - for the identification of regular structures in 3D point distributions. Motivated by the possible existence of the so called Council of Giants, i.e. a ring of twelve massive galaxies surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet with a radius of 3.75 Mpc, we apply HINORA to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue confirming its existence. When varying the lower limit of K-band luminosity of the galaxy entering the catalogue, we further report on the existence of another ring-like structure in the Local Volume that now contains the Milky Way and M31. However, this newly found structure is dominated by low-mass (satellite) galaxies. While we here simply present the novel method as well as its first application to observational data, follow-up work using numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation shall shed light into the origin of such regular patterns in the galaxy distribution. Further, the method is equally suited to identify similar (or even different) structures in various kinds of astrophysical data (e.g. locating the actual 'baryonic-acoustic oscillation spheres' in galaxy redshift surveys).</description>

Abstract: In this book, we study Statistical Physics under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, starting from the definition of statistical ensembles. The book is divided into five chapters: First, a brief introduction to statistical methods. Second, the statistical description of isolated systems, corresponding to microcanonical ensembles. Third, the statistical description of systems in contact with a heat reservoir at a constant temperature T, known as the canonical ensemble. Fourth, the description of systems in contact with a heat reservoir at temperature T and with a constant chemical potential {\mu}; the grand canonical ensemble. And finally, quantum statistics. In each chapter, a theoretical description, worked examples, links to simulations (see GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidalejandromiranda/StatisticalPhysics) and discussions on recent scientific reports will be presented so readers can complement their studies.</description>

      <title>"Layer-by-layer" Unsupervised Clustering of Statistically Relevant Fluctuations in Noisy Time-series Data of Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07786v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems are typically characterized by intricate internal dynamics that are often hard to elucidate. Ideally, this requires methods that allow to detect and classify in unsupervised way the microscopic dynamical events occurring in the system. However, decoupling statistically relevant fluctuations from the internal noise remains most often non-trivial. Here we describe "Onion Clustering": a simple, iterative unsupervised clustering method that efficiently detects and classifies statistically relevant fluctuations in noisy time-series data. We demonstrate its efficiency by analyzing simulation and experimental trajectories of various systems with complex internal dynamics, ranging from the atomic- to the microscopic-scale, in- and out-of-equilibrium. The method is based on an iterative detect-classify-archive approach. In similar way as peeling the external (evident) layer of an onion reveals the internal hidden ones, the method performs a first detection and classification of the most populated dynamical environment in the system and of its characteristic noise. The signal of such dynamical cluster is then removed from the time-series data and the remaining part, cleared-out from its noise, is analyzed again. At every iteration, the detection of hidden dynamical sub-domains is facilitated by an increasing (and adaptive) relevance-to-noise ratio. The process iterates until no new dynamical domains can be uncovered, revealing, as an output, the number of clusters that can be effectively distinguished/classified in statistically robust way as a function of the time-resolution of the analysis. Onion Clustering is general and benefits from clear-cut physical interpretability. We expect that it will help analyzing a variety of complex dynamical systems and time-series data.</description>

      <title>Assessment of few-hits machine learning classification algorithms for low energy physics in liquid argon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics potential of massive liquid argon TPCs in the low-energy regime is still to be fully reaped because few-hits events encode information that can hardly be exploited by conventional classification algorithms. Machine learning (ML) techniques give their best in these types of classification problems. In this paper, we evaluate their performance against conventional (deterministic) algorithms. We demonstrate that both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer-Encoder methods outperform deterministic algorithms in one of the most challenging classification problems of low-energy physics (single- versus double-beta events). We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of Transformer-Encoder methods versus CNN and employ these methods to optimize the detector parameters, with an emphasis on the DUNE Phase II detectors ("Module of Opportunity").</description>

      <title>Generalizable improvement of the Spalart-Allmaras model through assimilation of experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the use of model and data fusion for improving the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions of separated flows. In particular, our goal is to develop of models that not-only assimilate sparse experimental data to improve performance in computational models, but also generalize to unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman Filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via a parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients for separated flows. Despite using of observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D-bump and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for external, unseparated flows, such as flow around a NACA-0012 airfoil without any danger of extrapolation, and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model are targeted towards specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.</description>
