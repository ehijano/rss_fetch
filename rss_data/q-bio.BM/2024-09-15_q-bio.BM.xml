      <title>Diffusion and Spectroscopy of H$_2$ in Myoglobin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusional dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in myoglobin (Mb) is characterized. Hydrogen has been implicated in a number of physiologically relevant processes, including cellular aging or inflammation. Here, the internal diffusion through the protein matrix was characterized and the vibrational spectroscopy was investigated using conventional empirical energy functions and improved models able to describe higher-order electrostatic moments of the ligand. H$_2$ can occupy the same internal defects as already found for Xe or CO (Xe1 to Xe4 and B-state). Furthermore, 4 additional sites were found, some of which had been discovered in earlier simulation studies. The vibrational spectra using the most refined energy function indicate that depending on the docking site the spectroscopy of H$_2$ differs. The maxima of the absorption spectra cover $\sim 20$ cm$^{-1}$ which are indicative of a pronounced effect of the surrounding protein matrix on the vibrational spectroscopy of the ligand. Electronic structure calculations show that H$_2$ forms a stable complex with the heme-iron (stabilized by $\sim -12$ kcal/mol) but splitting of H$_2$ is unlikely due to a high activation energy ($\sim 50$ kcal/mol).</description>

      <title>Integrating Chemical Language and Molecular Graph in Multimodal Fused Deep Learning for Drug Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting molecular properties is a challenging but essential task in drug discovery. Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information, Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively, which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.</description>
