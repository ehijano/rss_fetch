      <description>arXiv:2601.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S.E. Hans paper, Remarks on Pseudocovering Spaces in a Digital Topological Setting: A Corrigendum, is meant to address errors in previous papers. However, this paper is also marked by errors in its mathematics, as well as improprieties in its citations. We address these flaws in the current work.</description>

      <title>A whittled complex for the Khovanov homology of torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algorithm for reducing the number of generators of the Khovanov chain complex of the torus braid $ft^k_n = (\sigma_1\sigma_2\cdots \sigma_{n-1})^k$ on $n$ strands by applying Bar-Natan Gaussian elimination along a distinguished set of Gaussian elimination isomorphisms. We call the resulting complex $\mathcal{FT}^k_n$ a \emph{whittled complex} for the Khovanov homology of torus braids. Using this algorithm, we provide a bound for the number of generators at a fixed homological degree in our whittled complex.</description>

      <title>Geometric obstructions for $\xi$-fillings of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the realisation problem for normal 1-types of 4-manifolds with a given boundary. More precisely, given a normal 1-type $\xi$ and closed 3-dimensional $\xi$-manifold $Y$, does there exist a compact 4-dimensional $\xi$-manifold with boundary $Y$? We describe a three stage obstruction theory for the existence of such a 4-manifold, with our main contribution being a `tertiary' obstruction that we describe geometrically via Wall's quadratic self-intersection form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the Kuperberg program by giving a diagrammatic presentation of generators and relations for the affine $E_7$ unshaded subfactor planar algebra. Using this presentation, we prove that its jellyfish algorithm is a well-defined surjection onto $\mathbb{C}$. In particular, this shows that the jellyfish algorithm is an invariant on closed diagrams for this planar algebra.</description>

      <title>Unbraided wiring diagrams for Stein fillings of lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work, we constructed a planar Lefschetz fibration on each Stein filling of any lens space equipped with its canonical contact structure. Here we describe an algorithm to draw an unbraided wiring diagram whose associated planar Lefschetz fibration obtained by the method of Plamenevskaya and Starkston, where the lens space with its canonical contact structure is viewed as the contact link of a cyclic quotient singularity, is equivalent to the Lefschetz fibration we constructed on each Stein filling of the lens space at hand. Coupled with the work of Plamenevskaya and Starkston, we obtain the following result as a corollary: The wiring diagram we describe can be extended to an arrangement of symplectic graphical disks in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with marked points, including all the intersection points of these disks, so that by removing the proper transforms of these disks from the blowup of $\mathbb{C}^2$ along those marked points one recovers the Stein filling along with the Lefschetz fibration. Moreover, the arrangement is related to the decorated plane curve germ representing the cyclic quotient singularity by a smooth graphical homotopy.
  As another application, we set up an explicit bijection between the Stein fillings of any lens space with its canonical contact structure, and the Milnor fibers of the corresponding cyclic quotient singularity, which was first obtained by N\'{e}methi and Popescu-Pampu, using different methods.</description>

      <title>The relative $h$-principle for closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration with avoidance and transversality arguments to prove the relative $h$-principle for closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms on oriented 6-manifolds. As corollaries, it is proven that if an oriented 6-manifold $\mathrm{M}$ admits any $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form, then every degree 3 cohomology class on $\mathrm{M}$ can be represented by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and, moreover, that the corresponding Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms representing this class is necessarily unbounded above. Essential to the proof of the $h$-principle is a careful analysis of the rank 3 distributions induced by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and their interaction with generic pairs of hyperplanes. The proof also introduces a new property of sets in affine space, termed macilence, as a method of verifying ampleness.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Doubly Periodic Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doubly periodic tangles, or DP tangles, are embeddings of curves in the thickened plane that are periodically repeated in two directions. They are defined as universal covers of their generating cells, the flat motifs, which represent knots and links in the thickened torus, and which can be chosen in infinitely many ways. DP tangles are used in modeling materials and physical systems of entangled filaments. In this paper we establish the complete mathematical framework of the topological theory of DP tangles. We present an exhaustive analysis of DP tangle isotopies. These are distinguished in local isotopies and global isotopies. Our analysis yields the characterization of DP isotopy as an equivalence relation on the level of their (flat) motifs, called DP tangle equivalence. Along the way we also discuss motif minimality. We further generalize our results to other diagrammatic categories, namely framed, virtual, welded, singular, pseudo, tied and bonded DP tangles, which could be used in novel applications.</description>

Abstract: We prove the congruence subgroup property for the centralizer of a finite subgroup $G$ in the mapping class group of a hyperbolic oriented and connected surface of finite topological type $S$ such that the genus of the quotient surface $S/G$ is at most $2$. As an application, we show that torsion elements in the mapping class group of a surface of genus $\leq 2$ are conjugacy distinguished.</description>

      <title>An exploration of low crossing and chiral cosmetic bands with grid diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We computationally explore non-coherent band attachments between low crossing number knots, using grid diagrams. We significantly improve the current H(2)-distance table. In particular, we find two new distance one pairs with fewer than seven crossings: one between $3_1\#3_1$ and $7_4m$, and a chirally cosmetic one for $7_3$. We further determine a total of 33 previously unknown H(2)-distance one pairs for knots with up to $8$ crossings. The appendix by Kazuhiro Ichihara, In Dae Jong and Masakazu Teragaito contains a construction explaining the existence of chirally cosmetic bands for an infinite family of knots, including $5_1,\, 7_3$ and $8_8$.</description>

      <title>A general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves a general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ on a compact orbifold $E$, subject to suitable limiting conditions on the metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ as $\mu \to \infty$. The result is distinct from similar theorems in the literature since it does not require bounds on curvature or injectivity radius of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ and thus allows for Gromov-Hausdorff limits of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ which have strictly lower dimension than $E$. The paper also introduces and studies a new class of stratified fibrations between orbifolds, termed weak submersions, and new classes of geometric structures on orbifolds, termed stratified Riemannian metrics, stratified Riemannian semi-metrics and stratified quasi-Finslerian structures, all of which play a key role in the proof of the main theorem.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and associated collapsing results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses scaling arguments to prove the unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms for two explicit closed 7-manifolds. The first manifold is the product $X \times S^1$ (where $X$ is the Nakamura manifold constructed by de Bartolomeis-Tomassini) equipped with a 4-dimensional family of closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and is inspired by a short paper of Fern\'{a}ndez. The second is the manifold recently constructed by Fern\'{a}ndez-Fino-Kovalev-Mu\~{n}oz. In the latter example, careful resolution of singularities is required, in order to ensure that the rescaled forms are cohomologically constant. By combining suitable geometric estimates with a general collapsing theorem for orbifolds recently obtained by the author, explicit descriptions of the large volume limits of both manifolds are also obtained. The proofs in this paper are notable for not requiring explicit solution of the Laplacian flow evolution PDE for closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, thereby allowing treatment of manifolds which lack the high degree of symmetry generally required for Laplacian flow to be explicitly soluble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper combines explicit local calculations with covering arguments to prove the unboundedness above and below (in a logarithmic sense) of the Donaldson-Hitchin functionals on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms, over compact manifolds (or, more generally, orbifolds) with boundary. In addition, the Donaldson-Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms over compact manifolds (or orbifolds) with boundary is shown to be unbounded below. As scholia, the critical points of the functionals on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms are shown to be saddles, and initial conditions of the Laplacian coflow which do not lead to convergent solutions are shown to be dense.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants of Joyce orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two new spectral invariants of torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on closed orbifolds and computes their values on all Joyce orbifolds. These invariants are shown to be more discerning than the $\overline{\nu}$-invariant of Crowley-Goette-Nordstr\"{o}m when applied to Joyce orbifolds, and thus provide candidate tools for distinguishing between Joyce manifolds. The invariants may be viewed as regularisations of the classical Morse indices of the critical points of the Hitchin functionals on closed and coclosed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures respectively. In the case of Joyce orbifolds, an interesting link with twisted Epstein $\zeta$-functions is also observed.</description>

      <title>Relative $h$-principles for closed stable forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration to develop a new, general method for proving relative $h$-principles for closed, stable, exterior forms on manifolds. This method is applied to prove the relative $h$-principle for 4 classes of closed stable forms which were previously not known to satisfy the $h$-principle, $\textit{viz.}$ stable $(2k-2)$-forms in $2k$ dimensions, stable $(2k-1)$-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms. The method is also used to produce new, unified proofs of all three previously established $h$-principles for closed, stable forms, $\textit{viz.}$ the $h$-principles for closed stable 2-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms and closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ 3-forms. In addition, it is shown that if a class of closed stable forms satisfies the relative $h$-principle, then the corresponding Hitchin functional (whenever defined) is necessarily unbounded above.
  Due to the general nature of the $h$-principles considered in this paper, the application of convex integration requires an analogue of Hodge decomposition on arbitrary $n$-manifolds (possibly non-compact, or with boundary) which cannot, to the author's knowledge, be found elsewhere in the literature. Such a decomposition is proven in Appendix A.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses algebro-topological techniques such as characteristic classes and obstruction theory, together with the $h$-principles for $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms recently established by the author and the $h$-principle for $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms established by Donaldson, to prove results on the topological properties of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on oriented 6- and 7-manifolds. Specifically, a criterion for an arbitrary oriented 7-manifold to admit a closed (resp. coclosed) $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structure is obtained, proving a conjecture of L\^{e}; a generalisation of Donaldson's '$\mathrm{G}_2$-cobordisms' to $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms is introduced, with homotopic $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms in a given cohomology class shown to be $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-cobordant, a result which currently has no analogue in the $\mathrm{G}_2$ case; and a complete classification of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms up to homotopy is provided. Additionally, a lower bound on the number of homotopy classes of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on a given manifold is obtained, and the question of which closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms arise as the boundary values of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structures on oriented 7-manifolds is investigated.</description>

      <title>Bi-orderability and generalized torsion elements from the perspective of profinite properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using fiber products, we construct bi-orderable groups from left-orderable groups. As an application, we show that bi-orderability is not a profinite property, answering a question of Piwek and Wykowski negatively. We also show that the existence of a generalized torsion element is not a profinite property.</description>

      <title>Automaticity of non-positively curved $k$-fold triangle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that non-positively curved $k$-fold triangle groups have finitely many cone types, and hence a regular language of all geodesics. Further, we prove that the language of lexicographically first geodesics is both regular and satisfies the fellow traveller property, giving an automatic structure for this family of groups.</description>
