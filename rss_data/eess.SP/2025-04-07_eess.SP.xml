      <title>Explainable Dual-Attention Tabular Transformer for Soil Electrical Resistivity Prediction: A Decision Support Framework for High-Voltage Substation Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel dual-attention transformer architecture for predicting soil electrical resistivity, a critical parameter for high-voltage substation construction. Our model employs attention mechanisms operating across both features and data batches, enhanced by feature embedding layers that project inputs into higher-dimensional spaces. We implements Particle Swarm Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, systematically optimizing embedding dimensions, attention heads, and neural network architecture. The proposed architecture achieves superior predictive performance (Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 0.63%) compared to recent state of the art models for tabular data. Crucially, our model maintains explainability through SHapley Additive exPlanations value analysis, revealing that fine particle content and dry density are the most influential parameters affecting soil resistivity. We developes a web-based application implementing this model to provide engineers with an accessible decision support framework that bridges geotechnical and electrical engineering requirements for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. This integrated approach satisfies both structural stability and electrical safety standards, improving construction efficiency and safety compliance in high-voltage infrastructure implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced ECG Arrhythmia Detection Accuracy by Optimizing Divergence-Based Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI computation in healthcare faces significant challenges when clinical datasets are limited and heterogeneous. Integrating datasets from multiple sources and different equipments is critical for effective AI computation but is complicated by their diversity, complexity, and lack of representativeness, so we often need to join multiple datasets for analysis. The currently used method is fusion after normalization. But when using this method, it can introduce redundant information, decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio and reducing classification accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose a feature-based fusion algorithm utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our approach involves initially preprocessing and continuous estimation on the extracted features, followed by employing the gradient descent method to identify the optimal linear parameters that minimize the KL divergence between the feature distributions. Using our in-house datasets consisting of ECG signals collected from 2000 healthy and 2000 diseased individuals by different equipments and verifying our method by using the publicly available PTB-XL dataset which contains 21,837 ECG recordings from 18,885 patients. We employ a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model to do the binary classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method significantly enhances feature-based classification accuracy for abnormal ECG cases in the merged datasets, compared to the normalization method. This data fusion strategy provides a new approach to process heterogeneous datasets for the optimal AI computation results.</description>

      <title>Drone Remote Identification Based on Zadoff-Chu Sequences and Time-Frequency Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences and time-frequency images (TFI) to achieve drone remote identification (RID). Specifically, by analyzing the modulation parameters and frame structures of drone ratio-frequency (RF) signals in the DroneRFa dataset, we extract prior information about ZC sequences with surprising correlation properties and robustness. Cross-correlation is performed between locally generated ZC sequences and drone signals to derive ZC sequence-based features. Then, these ZF sequence features are fused with TFI features containing communication protocol information to achieve drone RID. To reduce computational costs, data reduction of the cross-correlation features is performed by analyzing the frame structures and modulation parameters, ensuring that the feature performance remained unaffected. Three feature fusion methods, namely probability-weighted addition, feature vector addition, and feature vector concatenation, are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the average accuracy by at least 2.5\% compared to existing methods, which also indicate robust RID performance under burst interference and background noise. For RF sampling signals at varying flight distances, the proposed algorithm achieves a maximum accuracy of 99.11\%.</description>

      <title>Precision yield estimation and mapping in manual strawberry harvesting with instrumented picking carts and a robust data processing pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution yield maps for manually harvested crops are impractical to generate on commercial scales because yield monitors are available only for mechanical harvesters. However, precision crop management relies on accurately determining spatial and temporal yield variability. This study presents the development of an integrated system for precision yield estimation and mapping for manually harvested strawberries. Conventional strawberry picking carts were instrumented with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and load cells to record real-time geo-tagged harvest data and cart motion. Extensive data were collected in two strawberry fields in California, USA, during a harvest season. To address the inconsistencies and errors caused by the sensors and the manual harvesting process, a robust data processing pipeline was developed by integrating supervised deep learning models with unsupervised algorithms. The pipeline was used to estimate the yield distribution and generate yield maps for season-long harvests at the desired grid resolution. The estimated yield distributions were used to calculate two metrics: the total mass harvested over specific row segments and the total mass of trays harvested. The metrics were compared to ground truth and achieved accuracies of 90.48% and 94.05%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimated yield based on the number of trays harvested per cart for season-long harvest was better than 94%. It showed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.99) with the actual number of counted trays in both fields. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical solution for specialty crops, assisting in efficient yield estimation and mapping, field management, and labor management for sustainable crop production.</description>

      <title>Integrating Notch Filtering and Statistical Methods for Improved Cardiac Diagnostics Using MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Notch Filter is essential in ECG signal processing to eliminate narrowband noise, especially powerline interference at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This interference overlaps with vital ECG signal features, affecting the accuracy of downstream classification tasks (e.g., arrhythmia detection). A properly designed notch filter enhances signal quality, preserves essential ECG components (P, QRS, T waves), and improves the performance of machine learning or deep learning models used for ECG classification.</description>

      <title>Single-Satellite Navigation on Lunar North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon is a primary focus of space exploration. Current navigation methods face significant limitations in providing precise location data for lunar missions. In particular, existing methods often require direct Line of Sight to Earth, have limited capacity, and suffer from long signal travel times. This paper aims to tackle these challenges through a novel single satellite navigation system at the lunar North Pole. By utilising the Doppler effect, this system facilitates 3D geolocation of a stationary receiver on the lunar surface. Key findings include choosing a Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) suitable for North Pole coverage, designing a 3-step geolocation algorithm tailored to lunar conditions, constructing a comprehensive error budget, and evaluating the system performance through Dilution of Position (DOP).</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Electrode Shift on Classification Performance in Electromyography-Based Motion Prediction Using Sliding-Window Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are used in many applications, including prosthetic hands, assistive suits, and rehabilitation. Recent advances in motion estimation have improved performance, yet challenges remain in cross-subject generalization, electrode shift, and daily variations. When electrode shift occurs, both transfer learning and adversarial domain adaptation improve classification performance by reducing the performance gap to -1\% (eight-class scenario). However, additional data are needed for re-training in transfer learning or for training in adversarial domain adaptation. To address this issue, we investigated a sliding-window normalization (SWN) technique in a real-time prediction scenario. This method combines z-score normalization with a sliding-window approach to reduce the decline in classification performance caused by electrode shift. We validated the effectiveness of SWN using experimental data from a target trajectory tracking task involving the right arm. For three motions classification (rest, flexion, and extension of the elbow) obtained from EMG signals, our offline analysis showed that SWN reduced the differential classification accuracy to -1.0\%, representing a 6.6\% improvement compared to the case without normalization (-7.6\%). Furthermore, when SWN was combined with a strategy that uses a mixture of multiple electrode positions, classification accuracy improved by an additional 2.4\% over the baseline. These results suggest that SWN can effectively reduce the performance degradation caused by electrode shift, thereby enhancing the practicality of EMG-based motion estimation systems.</description>

      <title>Fair and Energy-Efficient Activation Control Mechanisms for Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) has been the core of 5G due to its ability to improve spectral efficiency and spatial multiplexing significantly; however, cell-edge users still experience performance degradation due to inter-cell interference and uneven signal distribution. While cell-free mMIMO (cfmMIMO) addresses this issue by providing uniform coverage through distributed antennas, it requires significantly more deployment cost due to the fronthaul and tight synchronization requirements. Alternatively, repeater-assisted massive MIMO (RA-MIMO) has recently been proposed to extend the coverage of cellular mMIMO by densely deploying low-cost single-antenna repeaters capable of amplifying and forwarding signals. In this work, we investigate amplification control for the repeaters for two different goals: (i) providing a fair performance among users, and (ii) reducing the extra energy consumption by the deployed repeaters. We propose a max-min amplification control algorithm using the convex-concave procedure for fairness and a joint sleep mode and amplification control algorithm for energy efficiency, comparing long- and short-term strategies. Numerical results show that RA-MIMO, with maximum amplification, improves signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by over 20 dB compared to mMIMO and performs within 1 dB of cfmMIMO when deploying the same number of repeaters as access points in cfmMIMO. Additionally, our majority-rule-based long-term sleep mechanism reduces repeater power consumption by 70% while maintaining less than 1% spectral efficiency outage.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor localization that utilizes crowdsourced data {\em without location labels}. We leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our {\em unsupervised} statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data, achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the {\em supervised} approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Permutational Index Modulation for Noncoherent Massive SIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches a near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Encoded Modulation for High-Fidelity Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) offers valuable insights into scattering mediums, but the quest for high-resolution imaging often requires dense sampling strategies, leading to higher imaging errors and lengthy acquisition times. This work introduces Space-Time Encoded Modulation (STEM), a novel light modulation scheme enabling low-noise, high-resolution imaging with single-pixel detectors. In STEM, a laser illuminates the sample, and the transmitted light is detected using a single pixel detector. The detected image is partitioned into a two-dimensional array of sub-images, each encoded with a unique quasi-orthogonal code. These coded sub-images represent light transmission at specific locations along the sample boundary. A single-pixel detector then measures their combined transmission. By virtue of their quasi-orthogonality, the relative strength of each sub-image can be measured, enabling image formation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical description and experimental validation of the STEM method. Compared to traditional raster scanning, STEM significantly enhances imaging quality, reducing imaging errors by up to 60% and yielding a 3.5-fold increase in reconstruction contrast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of effective prompt strategies for generating realistic datasets using Text-To-Audio (TTA) models. We also analyze different techniques for efficiently combining these datasets to enhance their utility in sound classification tasks. By evaluating two sound classification datasets with two TTA models, we apply a range of prompt strategies. Our findings reveal that task-specific prompt strategies significantly outperform basic prompt approaches in data generation. Furthermore, merging datasets generated using different TTA models proves to enhance classification performance more effectively than merely increasing the training dataset size. Overall, our results underscore the advantages of these methods as effective data augmentation techniques using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Early detection of diabetes through transfer learning-based eye (vision) screening and improvement of machine learning model performance and advanced parameter setting algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious and common complication of diabetes, caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the small retinal blood vessels. If left untreated, DR can progress to retinal vein occlusion and stimulate abnormal blood vessel growth, significantly increasing the risk of blindness. Traditional diabetes diagnosis methods often utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract visual features from retinal images, followed by classification algorithms such as decision trees and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for disease detection. However, these approaches face several challenges, including low accuracy and sensitivity, lengthy machine learning (ML) model training due to high data complexity and volume, and the use of limited datasets for testing and evaluation. This study investigates the application of transfer learning (TL) to enhance ML model performance in DR detection. Key improvements include dimensionality reduction, optimized learning rate adjustments, and advanced parameter tuning algorithms, aimed at increasing efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 84% on the testing dataset, outperforming prior studies. The highest class-specific accuracy reached 89%, with a maximum sensitivity of 97% and an F1-score of 92%, demonstrating strong performance in identifying DR cases. These findings suggest that TL-based DR screening is a promising approach for early diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Map-Based Path Loss Prediction</title>

Abstract: Path loss modeling is a widely used technique for estimating point-to-point losses along a communications link from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx). Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by &gt;8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Jamming Mitigation with Movable Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reveals the potential of movable antennas in enhancing anti-jamming communication. We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</description>

      <title>HeartBERT: A Self-Supervised ECG Embedding Model for Efficient and Effective Medical Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HeartBert model is introduced with three primary objectives: reducing the need for labeled data, minimizing computational resources, and simultaneously improving performance in machine learning systems that analyze Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in natural language processing and enhanced with a self-supervised learning approach, the HeartBert model-built on the RoBERTa architecture-generates sophisticated embeddings tailored for ECG-based projects in the medical domain. To demonstrate the versatility, generalizability, and efficiency of the proposed model, two key downstream tasks have been selected: sleep stage detection and heartbeat classification. HeartBERT-based systems, utilizing bidirectional LSTM heads, are designed to address complex challenges. A series of practical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority and advancements of HeartBERT, particularly in terms of its ability to perform well with smaller training datasets, reduced learning parameters, and effective performance compared to rival models. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ecgResearch/HeartBert.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Learning for Grant-Free Activity Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grant-free random access (GF-RA) is a promising access technique for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G) systems. Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating both statistical and machine-learning-based models for RUL estimation. Our approach transforms time-series battery data into time-to-failure data using path signatures, enabling effective survival modeling. We apply five models, including Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods such as DeepHit and MTLR, to estimate failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on 362 Toyota battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The proposed methodology provides actionable insights for battery manufacturers and engineers, supporting dynamic maintenance strategies and optimized lifecycle management.</description>
