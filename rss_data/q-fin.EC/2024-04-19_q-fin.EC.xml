      <title>A Comparative Study for Various Alternatives of Electric Vehicles, Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles and Hybrid Vehicles in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming popular as a viable means of transportation for the future. The use of EVs may help in providing better climatic conditions in urban areas with a pocket friendly cost for transportation to the consumers throughout its life. EVs enact as a boon to the society by providing zero tailpipe emissions, better comfort, low lifecycle cost and higher connectivity. The article aims to provide scientific information throughout the literature across various aspects of EVs in their lifetime and thus, assist the scholarly community and various organisations to understand the impact of EVs. In this study we have gathered information from the articles published in SCOPUS database and through grey literature with the focus of information post 2009. We have also used a hybrid methodology using Best-Worst Method (BWM) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for comparing EVs, internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and hybrid vehicles in various price segments. The study has helped us conclude that EVs should be preferred over ICEVs and hybrids by the users.</description>

      <title>Automated Social Science: Language Models as Scientist and Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico, social scientific hypotheses. This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.</description>

      <title>Income Shocks and their Transmission into Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the economics literature of, primarily, the last 20 years, that studies the link between income shocks and consumption fluctuations at the household level. We identify three broad approaches through which researchers estimate the consumption response to income shocks: 1.) structural methods in which a fully or partially specified model helps identify the consumption response to income shocks from the data; 2.) natural experiments in which the consumption response of one group who receives an income shock is compared to another group who does not; 3.) elicitation surveys in which consumers are asked how they expect to react to various hypothetical events.</description>

      <title>Portrait comparison of binary and weighted Skill Relatedness Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compare Skill-Relatedness Networks (SRNs) for selected countries, that is to say statistically significant inter-industrial interactions representing latent skills exchanges derived from observed labor flows, a kind of industry spaces. Using data from Argentina (ARG), Germany (DEU) and Sweden (SWE), we compare their SRNs utilizing an information-theoretic method that permits to compare networks of "non-aligned" nodes, which is the case of interest. For each SRN we extract its portrait, a fingerprint of structural measures of the distributions of their shortest paths, and calculate their pairwise divergences. This allows us also to contrast differences in structural (binary) connectivity with differences in the information provided by the (weighted) skill relatedness indicator (SR). We find that, in the case of ARG, structural connectivity is very different from their counterpart in DEU and SWE, but through the glass of SR the distances analyzed are all substantially smaller and more alike. These results qualify the role of the SR indicator as revealing some hidden dimension different from connectivity alone, providing empirical support to the suggestion that industry spaces may differ across countries.</description>

      <title>The Economic Value of User Tracking for Publishers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulators and browsers increasingly restrict user tracking to protect users' privacy online. In two large-scale empirical studies, we study the economic implications for publishers relying on selling advertising space to finance their content. In our first study, we draw on 42 million ad impressions from 111 publishers covering EU desktop browsing traffic in 2016. In our second study, we use 218 million ad impressions from 10,526 publishers (i.e., apps) covering EU and US mobile in-app browsing traffic in 2023. The two studies differ in the share of trackable users (Study 1: 85%; Study 2: Apple: 17%, Android: 91%). Still, we find similar average ad impression price decreases (Study 1: 18% and Study 2: 23%) when user tracking is unavailable. More than 90% of the publishers realize lower prices when selling ad impressions for untrackable users. Publishers offering content on sports, cars, lifestyle &amp; shopping, and news &amp; information suffer the most. Premium publishers with high-quality edited content and strong reputations, thematic-focused (niche) publishers, and smaller publishers suffer less from the unavailability of user tracking. In contrast, non-premium publishers with non-edited or user-generated content, thematic-broad (general news) publishers, and larger publishers suffer more. The availability of a user ID generates the highest value for publishers, whereas collecting a user's browsing history, perceived as intrusive by most users, generates only a small value for publishers. These results affirm that ensuring user privacy online has substantial costs for online publishers, but those costs differ across publishers and the type of collected data. This article offers suggestions to reduce these costs.</description>
