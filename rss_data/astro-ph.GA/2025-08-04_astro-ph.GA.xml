      <title>Discovery of a Little Red Dot candidate at $z\gtrsim10$ in COSMOS-Web based on MIRI-NIRCam selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z&gt;10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at $z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at $z&gt;10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of 25 um Interstellar Methanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first astrophysical detection of methanol (CH3OH) in the torsional band near 25 um. Using high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy, we identified over seventy gas-phase CH3OH absorption lines between 20 and 28 um towards the massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS 1 with SOFIA/EXES. We derive a temperature of 180 K and a total column density of 2 x 10^17 cm-2, comparable to sub-mm measurements. Complementary analysis of acetylene (C2H2) absorption lines is also included. Both CH3OH and C2H2 reveal an unresolved second velocity component. These MIR absorption lines likely probe the molecular material in two edge-on disks, supporting the scenario that NGC 7538 IRS 1 consists of multiple protostars. We provide an updated line list for the torsional band of CH3OH, which was generated from lab work and model calculations. This discovery and the updated line list will enable the search for CH3OH in JWST/MIRI spectra.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -4.8$ Star in $Gaia$ XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of GDR3_526285 ($Gaia$ DR3 Source ID 5262850721755411072), a star with $\rm[Fe/H] = -4.82 \pm 0.25$ and one of the lowest metal ($\text{atomic number} &gt; 2$) mass fractions ever found ($Z_{\rm GDR3\_526585} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$). We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\rm[Fe/H] &lt; -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\rm eff} = 4596\,{\rm K}$, $\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\rm[C/H] &lt; -4.32$, resulting in $\rm[C/Fe] &lt; +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\Delta \rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\rm[C/Fe]_{\rm cor} &lt; +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful "treasure map" for finding additional UMP stars.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of omega Centauri -- I. Luminosity and mass functions of its main sequence populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study of the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, omega Centauri, employing recently acquired JWST deep images. By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.</description>

      <title>Accretion disc reverberation mapping in a high-redshift quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z&lt;0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: III. Constraints on Radio Broadcasts from the Cosmic Population of Inhabited Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any population of artificial radio broadcasts in a galaxy contributes to its integrated radio luminosity. If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited galaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies. We can detect these broadcasts individually or set constraints from their collective emission. Using the formalism in Paper I and II, I set bounds on the artificial radio galaxy population using both of these methodologies. Measured radio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum, including the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints at ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in the fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but generally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with dedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into discrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of Kardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars, about one in a million large galaxies. I also examine limits for a power-law distribution in broadcast luminosity.</description>

      <title>An Observed Evidence for the Primordial Origin of Galaxy Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an observational evidence supporting the scenario that the protogalactic angular momenta play the most decisive role in molding the optical sizes of present galaxies. Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\le z&lt;0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\%$ and $90\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model. Assuming the existence of a linear causal correlation between $\{r_{50},r_{90}\}$ of the late-type galaxies and the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the degree of misalignments between the initial tidal and protogalaxy inertia tensors, we reconstruct the probability density distributions, $p(\tau)$, directly from the observationally determined $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ of the late-type galaxies, and show excellent agreements with the real distributions of $\tau$ which were determined at the protogalactic stages by numerical experiments. A critical implication of our result on reconstructing the initial conditions from observable galaxy sizes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origins of Galactic Globular Clusters via Their Mg-Al Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) originated in diverse host galaxies before being subsequently incorporated into the Milky Way through hierarchical galaxy assembly. Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] &gt; -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>A sample of giant radio sources from the NVGRC catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z&lt;0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z&gt;0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances of seven stars in the GD-1 stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed chemical abundances for seven GD-1 stream stars from Subaru/HDS spectroscopy. Atmospheric parameters were derived via color calibrations ($T\rm_{eff}$) and iterative spectroscopic analysis. LTE abundances for 14 elements ($\alpha$, odd-Z, iron-peak, n-capture) were measured. Six stars trace the main orbit, one resides in a `blob'. All exhibit tightly clustered metallicities ([Fe/H] = -2.38, {\bf intrinsic dispersion smaller than 0.05 dex, average uncertainty is about 0.13 dex}). While one star shows binary mass transfer signatures, the other six display consistent abundance patterns (dispersions $&lt;$ uncertainties). Their iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Mn, Ni) match Milky Way halo stars. In contrast, Y and Sr are systematically lower than halo stars of similar [Fe/H]. Significantly, six stars show consistently enhanced [Eu/Fe] $\sim$ 0.60 ($\sigma$ = 0.08). A tight Ba-Eu correlation (r = 0.83, p=0.04) exists, with [Ba/Fe] = -0.03 $\pm$ 0.05, indicating a common r-process origin. This extreme chemical homogeneity strongly supports an origin from a single disrupted globular cluster. The lack of light-element anti-correlations may stem from our sample size or the progenitor's low mass.</description>

      <title>On type 1 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]. II. properties of long-term optical variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-peaked \oiii~profiles could potentially indicate kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs. We analyze long-term optical light curves of 35 type 1 AGNs with such features from our recent catalog in Zheng et al. (2025). These light curves are obtained from the Catalina Sky Survey and modeled using a Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. A control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs matched in redshift, intrinsic luminosity, and black hole mass is also studied. If the double-peaked \oiii~are caused by two type 1 AGNs (dual type 1 AGN), then the combined variability from the two AGNs would be expected to differ from that of a single type 1 AGN. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the variability timescale $\tau$ and intrinsic variability amplitude $\sigma$ between these double-peaked AGNs and the control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs. Crucially, computer simulations reveal that dual AGN systems systematically produce lower variability amplitudes than single AGNs, which is inconsistent with the observed variability properties of our double-peaked \oiii~sample. Moreover, simulations suggest that the fraction of dual type 1 AGNs is $\sim$ 3\%, indicating that double-peaked \oiii~may not be a reliable indicator of dual type 1 AGNs in these systems. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some objects may still host dual AGNs involving other combinations, such as type 1+type 2 AGNs. Future studies with larger samples and higher-quality light curves will help clarify the true nature of these systems.</description>

      <title>Analogues of the Milky Way-Sagittarius interaction in the TNG50: effect on the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies, however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50 to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50 kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1 Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases, a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs, e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.</description>

      <title>A normalizing flow approach for the inference of star cluster properties from unresolved broadband photometry I: Comparison to spectral energy distribution fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry is a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population (SSP) models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods suffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables in the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable. These limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods that offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior distributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing flow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our network's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous works. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic photometric observations for $5 \times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently, this data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability distributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric observations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the capabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available PHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We demonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the inference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially useful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable and in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various sources, very few sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), the IceCube neutrino observatory has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since operations began in 2010. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1 and the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network (AMON). Of the 350 alerts considered, 25 detections were found, with 1 coinciding with the flaring HAWC source Markarian 421, an active galactic nuclei. We present the performance of this method and a discussion of physics implications.</description>

      <title>Forming Double Neutron Stars using Detailed Binary Evolution Models with POSYDON: Comparison to the Galactic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Matter Accretion on Lithium Enhancement of Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset of low-mass giants ($&lt;2.2\,M_{\odot}$) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\rm \sim 2.5\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.</description>

      <title>The substellar population in Corona Australis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Dependence of halo properties on central-satellite magnitude gaps through weak lensing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}&lt;L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7} &lt;L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}&lt;L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.</description>

      <title>Forward cascade of large-scale primordial magnetic fields during structure formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of the Third Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spin, Color, Spectra and Dust Activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.</description>

      <title>The formation and disruption of globular cluster populations in simulations of present-day $L^\ast$ galaxies with controlled assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sensitive tracers of galaxy assembly histories but interpreting the information they encode is challenging because mergers are thought to promote both the formation and disruption of GCs. We use simulations with controlled merger histories to examine the influence of merger mass ratio on the GC population of a present-day $L^\ast$ galaxy, using the genetic modification technique to adjust the initial conditions of a galaxy that experiences major mergers at $z = 1.7$ and $0.77$ (ORGANIC case), so the later merger has twice its original mass ratio (ENHANCED case), or is prevented from occurring (SUPPRESSED case). We evolve the three realizations with E-MOSAICS (MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations with EAGLE), which couples subgrid star cluster formation and evolution models to the EAGLE (Evolution and assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) galaxy formation model. Relative to the ORGANIC case, the mass of surviving GCs is elevated (reduced) in the ENHANCED (SUPPRESSED) case, indicating that major mergers promote a net boost to the GC population. The boost is clearly quantified by the GC specific mass because it is sensitive to the number of the most massive GCs, whose long characteristic disruption time-scales enable them to survive their hostile natal environments. In contrast, the specific frequency is insensitive to assembly history because it primarily traces low-mass GCs that tend to be disrupted soon after their formation. The promotion of GC formation and disruption by major mergers imprints a lasting and potentially observable signature: an elevated mass fraction of field stars in the galaxy's stellar halo that were born in star clusters.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. While early transient surveys targeted on high star formation rate and metallicity galaxies, recent untargeted, wide-field surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, ZTF) have discovered large numbers of SNe without this bias. In this work, we construct a large sample of SNe discovered by wide-field untargted searches, consisting of 166 SNe of Types II(P), IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at $z \leq 0.02$ with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites, finding a range from $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.1$ to 8.7 dex. And the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4--8.5 dex. Our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within $\sim$1$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

      <title>Probing the Merger Rates of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies with Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mergers of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key drivers of galaxy evolution, contributing to the growth of both galaxies and their central black holes. Current and upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors -- Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin -- offer unique access to these processes by observing GW signals from SMBH binaries. We present a framework to infer galaxy and SMBH merger rates by combining mock LISA detections of SMBH mergers with PTA constraints on the stochastic GW background, while incorporating observational uncertainties in stellar mass functions and $M_\bullet$-$M_*$ relations. We find that the number of LISA-detected events and their joint distribution in mass and redshift are key to constraining merger rates -- datasets with around forty events yield results consistent with galaxy pair observations, whereas limited event counts lead to biases at high redshift. Including PTA data further reduces parameter uncertainties. Our method also effectively constrains the delay time between galaxy and SMBH mergers, with longer delays suppressing high-redshift SMBH merger rates and shifting mass growth from mergers to accretion. According to our mock analysis, the models with delay times longer than $0.5\text{Gyr}$ ($0.8\text{Gyr}$), accretion becomes the primary driver of SMBH mass growth beyond $z \sim 6$ ($4$). In contrast, the SMBH occupation fraction at $z&gt;3$ remains poorly constrained due to its degeneracies with delay time and the galaxy merger rate. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of using GW observations to probe the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Caught in the Act of Quenching? -- A Population of Post-Starburst Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of post-starburst ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), identified through spectroscopic analysis with KCWI at the Keck II Telescope. Our analysis is based on a sample of 44 candidate UDGs selected from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes) program. Our measured spectroscopic redshifts reveal $\sim 85\%$ of the entire KCWI sample exhibit large physical sizes ($R_{e} \gtrsim 1~{\rm kpc}$) and low surface brightnesses ($24 \lesssim \mu_{0,g} \lesssim 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) which categorize them as UDGs. We find $20\%$ of the confirmed UDG population contain post-starburst (or K+A) features, characterized by minimal to no emission in H$\beta$ indicative of quenched star formation and a predominant presence of spectral A-type stars. In surveying the local environments of the post-starburst UDGs, we find that nearly half are isolated systems, which is unusual given that isolated UDGs are most commonly found to be star-forming. Two of these systems reside $2-3~R_{\rm vir}$ away from potential nearby massive hosts ($M_{\star} &gt;10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), indicating the absence of environmental influence. These post-starburst UDGs may represent systems experiencing star formation feedback such that a recent burst may lead to (at least temporary) quenching. Overall, our results highlight the potentially diverse quenching pathways of UDGs in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). III. NGC 288 as the first Splashed globular cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The system of globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) comprises a mixture of both in situ and accreted clusters. Tracing the origin of GCs provides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However, reconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging. A notable example is NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available chrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion regarding its origin. On the one hand, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate an accreted origin for NGC 288 from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy. On the other hand, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than other GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different (and possibly in situ) origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on the origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an unprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC 288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar metallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within the homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three clusters are coeval, reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical interpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with a sample of in situ and accreted clusters at similar metallicity, finding again consistency with the chemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital properties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the MW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger. This is a fate that resembles that of proto-disc stars undergoing the so-called Splash event. Therefore, NGC 288 demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous chrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW GCs.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of black hole (BH) formation and growth seeded by gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshift, using a cosmological semi-analytical framework based on Monte Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that gravothermal collapse naturally leads to BH formation in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale set by the SIDM cross section, and occurs predominantly in the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of the little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simple models of BH growth and assuming a 100% duty cycle, we reproduce the observed LRD mass function for velocity-dependent cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30\,\mathrm{cm}^2\,\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which are consistent with independent constraints from local galaxies. While higher values of $\sigma_{0m}$ (or $\omega$) would overpredict the low-mass (or high-mass) end of the BH mass function, such deviations could be reconciled by invoking a reduced duty cycle or lower Eddington ratio. Our results suggest that the demographics of high-redshift BHs can serve as a novel and complementary probe of SIDM physics.</description>

      <title>A JWST View of the Overmassive Black Hole in NGC 4486B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. Across all tested dynamical models, the inferred $M_{BH}/M_*$ ratio ranges from ~ 4-13%, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} &lt; 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XVI. Tracing aromatic infrared band characteristics in photodissociation region spectra with PAHFIT in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT.
  We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. Using the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model, PAHFIT reproduces the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra.
  We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using K-means and Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying stars, galaxies, and quasars is essential for understanding cosmic structure and evolution; however, the vast data from modern surveys make manual classification impractical, while supervised learning methods remain constrained by the scarcity of labeled spectroscopic data. We aim to develop a scalable, label-efficient method for astronomical classification by leveraging semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome the limitations of fully supervised approaches. We propose a novel SSL framework combining K-means clustering with random forest classification. Our method partitions unlabeled data into 50 clusters, propagates labels from spectroscopically confirmed centroids to 95% of cluster members, and trains a random forest on the expanded pseudo-labeled dataset. We applied this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey photometric and spectroscopic data, and compared performance with a fully supervised random forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1 scores of 98.8%, 98.9%, and 92.0% for stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the supervised method with F1 scores of 99.1%, 99.1%, and 93.1%, while outperforming traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates robustness in high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency compared to prior work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for astronomical classification when labeled data is limited, though performance may be degraded in lower dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>On the origins of oxygen: ALMA and JWST characterise the multi-phase, metal-enriched, star-bursting medium within a 'normal' $z &gt; 11$ galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at $z &gt; 11$ revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z &gt; 11$ galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu &lt; 9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of $\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all $3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm 0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot" with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z &gt; 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</description>

      <title>ODS: A self-reporting system for radio telescopes to coexist with adaptive satellite constellations</title>

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>

      <title>The First Photometric Evidence of a Transient/Variable Source at z&gt;5 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$&gt;$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$&gt;$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a &lt; 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a &lt; 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a &lt; 100 au.</description>

      <title>Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>
