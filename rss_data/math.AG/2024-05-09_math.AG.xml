      <title>The Enumerative Geometry and Arithmetic of Banana Nano-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A banana manifold is a Calabi-Yau threefold fibered by Abelian surfaces whose singular fibers contain banana configurations: three rational curves meeting each other in two points. A nano-manifold is a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ with very small Hodge numbers: $h^{1,1}(X)+h^{2,1}(X)\leq 6$. We construct four rigid banana nano-manifolds $\tilde{X}_N$, $N\in \{5,6,8,9 \}$, each with Hodge numbers given by $(h^{1,1},h^{2,1})=(4,0)$.
  We compute the Donaldson-Thomas partition function for banana curve classes and show that the associated genus $g$ Gromov-Witten potential is a genus 2 meromorphic Siegel modular form of weight $2g-2$ for a certain discrete subgroup $P^{*}_{N} \subset Sp_{4}(\mathbb{R})$.
  We also compute the weight 4 modular form whose $p$th Fourier coefficient is given by the trace of the action of Frobenius on $H^{3}_{et }(\tilde{X}_N ,{\mathbb{Q}}_{l})$ for almost all prime $p$. We observe that it is the unique weight 4 cusp form on $\Gamma_{0}(N)$.</description>

      <title>Twisted tensor product, smooth DG algebras, and noncommutative resolutions of singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New families of algebras and DG algebras with two simple modules are introduced and described. Using the twisted tensor product operation, we prove that such algebras have finite global dimension, and the resulting DG algebras are smooth. This description allows us to show that some of these DG algebras determine smooth proper noncommutative curves that provide smooth minimal noncommutative resolutions for singular rational curves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markov triples, that means the positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, form the vertex set of the Markov tree. Each Markov triple defines a weighted projective plane, giving a geometric interpretation of the vertex. We exhibit a class of rational, projective $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces representing the edges of the Markov tree in the sense that they admit coverings onto the adjacent weighted projective planes. As an application, we obtain an explicit description of all normal degenerations of the projective plane admitting a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action.</description>

      <title>Tropical Feichtner-Yuzvinsky and positivity criterion for fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Chow ring of any simplicial fan is isomorphic to the middle degree part of the tropical cohomology ring of its canonical compactification. Using this result, we prove a tropical analogue of Kleiman's criterion of ampleness for fans.
  In the case of tropical fans that are homology manifolds, we obtain an isomorphism between the Chow ring of the fan and the entire tropical cohomology of the canonical compactification. When applied to matroids, this provides a new representation of the Chow ring of a matroid as the cohomology ring of a projective tropical manifold.</description>

      <title>K3 surfaces associated to a cubic fourfold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\subset \P^5$ be a smooth cubic fourfold. A well known conjecture asserts that $X$ is rational if and only if there an Hodge theoretically associated K3 surface $S$. The surface $S$ can be associated to $X$ in two other different ways. If there is an equivalence of categories $\sA_X \simeq D^b(S,\alpha)$ where $\sA_X$ is the Kuznetsov component of $D^b(X)$ and $\alpha$ is a Brauer class, or if there is an isomorphism between the transcendental motive $t(X)$ and the (twisted ) transcendental motive of a K3 surface$S$. In this note we consider families of cubic fourfolds with a finite group of automorphisms and describe the cases where there is an associated K3 surface in one of the above senses.</description>

      <title>Degree of the Grassmannian as an affine variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of the Grassmannian with respect to the Pl\"ucker embedding is well-known. However, the Pl\"ucker embedding, while ubiquitous in pure mathematics, is almost never used in applied mathematics. In applied mathematics, the Grassmannian is usually embedded as projection matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong \{P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : P^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = P = P^2,\; \operatorname{tr}(P) = k\}$ or as involution matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong \{X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : X^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = X,\; X^2 = I,\; \operatorname{tr}(X)=2k - n\}$. We will determine an explicit expression for the degree of the Grassmannian with respect to these embeddings. In so doing, we resolved a conjecture of Devriendt--Friedman--Sturmfels about the degree $\operatorname{Gr}(2, \mathbb{R}^n)$ and in fact generalized it to $\operatorname{Gr}(k, \mathbb{R}^n)$. We also proved a set theoretic variant of another conjecture of Devriendt--Friedman--Sturmfels about the limit of $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n)$ in the sense of Gr\"obner degneration.</description>

      <title>Divided Powers and Derived De Rham Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the formalism of derived divided power algebras, and revisit the theory of derived De Rham and crystalline cohomology in this framework. We characterize derived De Rham cohomology of a derived commutative ring $A$, together with the Hodge filtration on it, in terms of a universal property as the largest filtered divided power thickening of $A$. We show that our approach agrees with A.Raksit's. Along the way, we develop some fundamentals of square-zero extensions and derivations in derived algebraic geometry in connection with derived De Rham cohomology.</description>

      <title>Extending the Torelli map to alternative compactifications of the moduli space of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the limiting behaviour of the Jacobian as the underlying curve degenerates has been the subject of much interest. For nodal singularities, there are beautiful constructions of Caporaso as well as Pandharipande of compactified universal Jacobians over the moduli space of stable curves. Alexeev later obtained a canonical such compactification by extending the Torelli map out of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. In contrast, Alexeev and Brunyate proved that the Torelli map does not extend over the cuspidal locus in Schubert's alternative compactification of pseudostable curves.
  In this paper, we consider curves with singularities that locally look like the axes in $m$-space, which we call fold-like singularities. We construct an alternative compactification of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ consisting of curves with such singularities and prove that the Torelli map extends out of this compactification. Furthermore, for every alternative compactification in the sense of Smyth, we identify a fold-like locus over which the Torelli map extends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reexamine Smale's alpha theory as a way to certify a numerical solution to an analytic system. For a given point and a system, Smale's alpha theory determines whether Newton's method applied to this point shows the quadratic convergence to an exact solution. We introduce the alpha theory computation using interval arithmetic to avoid costly exact arithmetic. As a straightforward variation of the alpha theory, our work improves computational efficiency compared to software employing the traditional alpha theory.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we address the problem of whether all solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ are generated by the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We consider the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations and demonstrate that, indeed, in this case, all solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the local cohomology of vector fields on a manifold. In the smooth case this recovers the diagonal cohomology studied in work of Losik, Guillemin, Fuks and others. In the holomorphic case this cohomology has recently appeared in work of Hennion and Kapranov in their study of the Lie algebra cohomology of vector fields on a complex manifold. Additionally, we construct explicit representatives for cocycles in Gelfand--Fuks cohomology via descent.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish Hyodo--Kato theory with compact support for semistable schemes through rigid analytic methods. To this end we introduce several types of log rigid cohomology with compact support. moreover we show that additional structures on the (rigid) Hyodo--Kato cohomology and the Hyodo--Kato map introduced in our previous paper are compatible with Poincar\'{e} duality. Compared to the crystalline approach, the constructions are explicit yet versatile, and hence suitable for computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Browning and Vishe used the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to show the moduli space of rational curves on smooth hypersurfaces of low degree is irreducible and of the expected dimension. We reinterpret the circle method geometrically and prove a generalization for higher genus smooth projective curves. In particular, we explain how the geometry of numbers can be understood via the Beauville-Laszlo theorem in terms of vector bundles on curves and their slopes, allowing us to prove a higher genus variant of Davenport's shrinking lemma. As a corollary, we apply this result to show the Fujita invariant of any proper subvariety of a smooth hypersurface of low degree is less than 1.</description>

Abstract: For $n\ge 1$ we show that the length 1 nested Hilbert scheme of the total space $X_n$ of the line bundle $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^1}(-n)$, parameterizing pairs of nested 0-cycles in $X_n$, is a quiver variety associated with a suitable quiver with relations. This generalizes previous work about nested Hilbert schemes on $\mathbb C^2$ in one direction, and about the Hilbert schemes of points of $X_n$ in another direction.</description>

Abstract: Given a scheme over a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, the Greenberg transform produces a new scheme over the residue field thicker than the special fiber. In this paper, we will generalize this transform to the case of imperfect residue field. We will then construct a certain kind of cycle class map defined on this generalized Greenberg transform applied to the N\'eron model of a semi-abelian variety, which takes values in the relatively perfect nearby cycle functor defined by Kato and the second author.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of which sequences of non-negative integers arise as the functions $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} I^n$ for an ideal $I$ generated by forms of degree $d$ in a standard graded algebra $R$. These functions are asymptotically linear with slope $d$. If $\dim R/I = 0$, we give a complete characterization of all numerical functions which arise as the functions $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$, $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$ and show that $\operatorname{reg} I^n$ can be any numerical function $f(n) \ge dn$ that weakly decreases until it becomes a linear function with slope $d$. The latter result gives a negative answer to a question of Eisenbud and Ulrich. If $\dim R/I \ge 1$, we show that $\operatorname{reg} I^{n-1}/I^n$ can be any numerical asymptotically linear function $f(n) \ge dn-1$ with slope $d$ and $\operatorname{reg} R/I^n$ can be any numerical asymptotically linear function $f(n) \ge dn-1$ with slope $d$ that is weakly increasing. Inspired of a recent work of Ein, Ha and Lazarsfeld on non-singular complex projective schemes, we also prove that the function of the saturation degree of $I^n$ is asymptotically linear for an arbitrary graded ideal $I$ and study the behavior of this function.</description>

Abstract: Consider two families of $g$-dimensional abelian varieties induced by two distinct rational maps on the same variety $\overline{\mathcal A}$ onto two bases $\overline S_1$ and $\overline S_2$ and having big common domain of definition. Two non-torsion sections of these families induce two (birational) fiberwise translations on $\overline{\mathcal A}$, respectively. We show that if $\dim \overline S_1+\dim \overline S_2\le 2g$, the points with finite orbit under the action of a certain subset of the group generated by both translations lie in a proper Zariski closed subset that can be described to a certain extent. Our work is a higher dimensional generalization of a result of Corvaja, Tsimermann and Zannier.</description>

      <title>Special Joyce structures and hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00548</link>

Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>
