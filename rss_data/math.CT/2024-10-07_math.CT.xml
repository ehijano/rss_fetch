      <title>The bounded ideal monad on the category of quasi-metric spaces and its algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of bounded ideals is introduced for quasi-metric spaces. Such ideals give rise to a monad, the bounded ideal monad, on the category of quasi-metric spaces and non-expansive maps. Algebras of this monad are metric version of local dcpos of Mislove. It is shown that an algebra of the bounded ideal monad is a standard quasi-metric space of which the formal balls form a local dcpo; and that a continuous algebra is a standard quasi-metric space of which the formal balls form a local domain.</description>

      <title>Operadic Fibrations and Unary Operadic 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce unary operadic 2-categories as a framework for operadic Grothendieck construction for categorical $\mathbb{O}$-operads, $\mathbb{O}$ being a unary operadic category. The construction is a fully faithful functor $\int_\mathbb{O}$ which takes categorical $\mathbb{O}$-operads to operadic functors over $\mathbb{O}$, and we characterise its essential image by certain lifting properties. Such operadic functors are called operadic fibration. Our theory is an extension of the discrete (unary) operadic case and, in some sense, of the classical Grothendieck construction of a categorical presheaf. For the terminal unary operadic category $\odot$, a categorical $\odot$-operad is a strict monoidal category $\mathscr{V}$ and its Grothendieck construction $\int_\odot \mathscr{V}$ is connected to the `Para' construction appearing in machine learning. The 2-categorical setting provides a characterisation of $\mathbb{O}$-operads valued in $\mathscr{V}$ as operadic functors $\mathbb{O} \to \int_\odot \mathscr{V}$. Last, we describe a left adjoint to $\int_\odot$.</description>

      <title>On $n$-exact categories I: The existence and uniqueness of maximal $n$-exact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of a series that investigates the existence of $n$-exact structures on idempotent complete additive categories for positive integers $n$. It is shown that every idempotent complete additive category has a unique maximal $n$-exact structure. We achieve this by constructing a bijection between $n$-exact structures on a category and certain subcategories of its functor category following ideas of Enomoto.</description>

      <title>An exact structure approach to almost rigid modules over quivers of type $\mathbb{A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the path algebra of a quiver of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}_n$. The module category $\text{mod}\,A$ has a combinatorial model as the category of diagonals in a polygon $S$ with $n+1$ vertices. The recently introduced notion of almost rigid modules is a weakening of the classical notion of rigid modules. The importance of this new notion stems from the fact that maximal almost rigid $A$-modules are in bijection with the triangulations of the polygon $S.$
  In this article, we give a different realization of maximal almost rigid modules. We introduce a non-standard exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$ on $\text{mod}\,A$ such that the maximal almost rigid $A$-modules in the usual exact structure are exactly the maximal rigid $A$-modules in the new exact structure. A maximal rigid module in this setting is the same as a tilting module. Thus the tilting theory relative to the exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$ translates into a theory of maximal almost rigid modules in the usual exact structure.
  As an application, we show that with the exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, the module category becomes a 0-Auslander category in the sense of Gorsky, Nakaoka and Palu.
  We also discuss generalizations to quivers of type $\mathbb{D}$ and gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>Applications of the circle product with a right $Com$-module to the theory of commutative ring spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If Com is the reduced commutative operad, the category of Com-algebras in spectra is the category of nounital commutative ring spectra. The theme of this survey is that many important constructions on Com-algebras are given by taking the derived circle product with well chosen right Com-modules. Examples of constructions arising this way include the tensor product of a based space K with such an algebra I, and TQ(I), the Topological Andre-Quillen homology spectrum of I. We then show how filtrations of right Com-modules can be used to filter such constructions. A natural decreasing filtration on right Com-modules, when specialized to the Com-bimodule Com, defines the augmentation ideal tower of I, built out of the extended powers of TQ(I). A natural increasing filtration on right Com-modules, when specialized to the right Com-module used to define TQ(I), defines a filtration on TQ(I) built out of I and the spaces in the Lie cooperad. There are two versions of this in the literature -- by the author and by Behrens and Rezk -- and our setting here makes it easy to prove that these agree. Much of this applies with Com replaced by a more general reduced operad, and we make a few remarks about this.</description>

      <title>Manifestly unitary higher Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher idempotent completion gives a formal inductive construction of the $n$-category of finite dimensional $n$-vector spaces starting with the complex numbers. We propose a manifestly unitary construction of low dimensional higher Hilbert spaces, formally constructing the $\mathrm{C}^*$-3-category of 3-Hilbert spaces from Baez's 2-Hilbert spaces, which itself forms a 3-Hilbert space. We prove that the forgetful functor from 3-Hilbert spaces to 3-vector spaces is fully faithful.</description>

      <title>An Enriched Small Object Argument Over a Cofibrantly Generated Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small object argument is a method for transfinitely constructing weak factorization systems originally motivated by homotopy theory. We establish a variant of the small object argument that is enriched over a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system. This enriched variant of the small object argument subsumes the ordinary small object argument for categories and also certain variants of the small object argument for 2-categories, (2,1)-categories, dg-categories and simplicially enriched categories. Along the way, we show that enriched functor categories can be enriched over the Day convolution monoidal product and in such a case become copowered.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

      <title>Categorical descriptions of one-dimensional gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the macroscopic observables in the 1+1D gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries and show that the spacetime observables for each gapped phase form a clear structure that can be mathematically described by enriched fusion categories, which uncovers the behavior of nonlocal excitations that were blurry in traditional Landau paradigm. These categorical descriptions not only generate the known classification results for symmetry preserving and breaking phases, but also unifies lattice dualities in a broader picture. After analyzing the general lattice model together with their boundaries, we give explicit examples including nontrivial SPT phase, where nontrivial boundaries can be given directly through our classification. Using enriched categorical descriptions, the lattice dualities and their gapped phases are unified under a holographic duality between an 2d. topological order with gapped 1d boundaries and 1+1D gapped quantum liquids with a categorical symmetry, which shed light on a unified definition of all quantum phases.</description>
