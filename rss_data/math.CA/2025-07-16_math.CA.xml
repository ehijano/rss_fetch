      <title>Generalized Jensen's inequality motivated from thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the work of P.T.Landsberg\cite{web1,web2} and S.S.Sidhu\cite{web3} by providing an inequality that has its main motivation from the laws of thermodynamics, in the form of a theorem which is quite useful in generating different inequalities such as the weighted AM-GM-HM inequality, the p-th power inequality , Jensen's inequality and many other inequalities.In this paper, we have not only given the thermodynamic motivation behind the inequality but we have given the required mathematical justification in the form of a straightforward rigorous proof using basic real analysis , which was not present in the works of Landsberg and Sidhu. In fact, the first statement of the theorem mathematically proves the uniqueness of the equilibrium temperature that is attained when n different bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact. The second statement of the theorem gives a mathematical proof of the fact that the process in which n bodies at different temperatures when brought in contact equilibriate to a common temperature is spontaneous,i.e., entropically favourable. Thus, this article motivates the students to come up with different mathematical results by observing the phenomena already existing in nature and also helps them to appreciate the conventional inequalities taught to them at the secondary school and undergraduate level by associating relevant physical phenomena with those inequalities.</description>

      <title>Sturm-Liouville operators with periodically modulated parameters. Part I: Regular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Sturm-Liouville operators with periodically modulated parameters. Their spectral properties depend on the monodromy matrix of the underlying periodic problem computed for the spectral parameter equal to $0$. Under certain assumptions, by studying the asymptotic behavior of Christoffel functions and density of states, we prove that the spectral density is a continuous positive everywhere function on the real line.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional, time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>
