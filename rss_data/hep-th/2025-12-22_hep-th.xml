      <title>Exploring the twisted sector of $\mathbb{Z}_{L}$ orbifolds: Matching $\alpha'$-corrections to localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider type IIB string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_{L}$ orbifold spaces with generic $L$. Recent localisation results in the dual 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ circular quiver gauge theories provide us with strong coupling expansions of certain correlators involving twisted half-BPS operators. To leading order, these results have been matched to an effective theory for massless twisted string states, which can be constructed by resolving the orbifold singularity and considering localised supergravity modes on the resolution cycles. Applying this reasoning to subleading order in strong coupling, we observe that for $L\neq 2,3,4,6$, a naive reduction of the 10d $(\alpha')^3$-correction does not result in the correct coefficients to match the localisation result. We explain this mismatch by the appearance of twisted sector resonances in string amplitudes involving external twisted sector states. We perform the low-energy expansion of a ``twisted'' Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude and recover the expected coefficients, suggesting that the orbifold resolution and the low-energy expansion can not be interchanged directly. Finally, we comment on the long-quiver limit, $L\to\infty$, in the context of the low-energy effective action.</description>

      <title>Continuum canonical purifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and characterize canonical purifications for general algebraic states, extending prior constructions by Woronowicz and by Dutta/Faulkner to general quantum field theories. Given a quantum state on a *-algebra, the canonical purification is a state on a "doubled" algebra that admits an interpretation in terms of CRT reflection. We study the conditions under which these enlarged states are "pure" in the technical sense, compute their modular conjugations, and relate them to GNS and natural-cone purifications in certain settings. In a forthcoming paper with Caminiti and Capeccia, we provide an application of this general theory to the problem of excitability in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>How gluon leading singularities discover curves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the leading singularities for pure gluon amplitudes obtained by on-shell gluing of three-particle amplitudes for an arbitrary graph in any number of dimensions. By encoding the polarization vector contractions in a graphical way, on-shell gluing "discovers" curves on surfaces, and we find that the leading singularity is determined by a simple combinatorial question: what are all ways of covering the graph with non-overlapping curves such that each edge is covered exactly once? This precisely matches the formula from the surfaceology formulation of gluons, where the leading singularities are given by maximal residues, with the combinatorial problem arising from the linearized form of the $u$ variables. At loop-level we describe how the novelties associated with spin sums (related with the need for ghosts when working off-shell using Lagrangians) can be easily encoded in this combinatorial picture. Matching the leading singularities also lets us settle an open question in the surface formulation of gluons, determining the exponents of the closed curves at any loop order.</description>

      <title>Gauging Open EFTs from the top down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\"uckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for St\"uckelberg/Goldstone fields.</description>

      <title>TASI Lectures on de Sitter Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures provide a self-contained introduction to flux compactifications of type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds. The first lecture begins with geometric foundations, then presents vacuum solutions in Calabi-Yau compactifications, as well as the geometry and physics of the moduli problem. The second lecture develops the classical theory of type IIB flux compactifications, both in ten dimensions and in the four-dimensional effective theory. The third lecture turns to the quantum theory of flux compactifications, including perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. With this foundation, in the fourth lecture we give a detailed treatment of the candidate de Sitter vacua recently constructed in arXiv:2406.13751. These notes are intended to be accessible to graduate students working in adjacent fields, and so extensive background material is included throughout.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oscillons are Long-Lived</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the longest lived transient, oscillons play a critical role in classical field theory simulations of many phenomena. However, beyond the classical approximation, it is well-known that quantum corrections open decay channels through which oscillons radiate rapidly. Therefore it is believed that in the real world, oscillons are too short-lived to be phenomenologically relevant. We observe that previous calculations of the radiated power assume that the oscillon is in a coherent state. We show that a squeezed coherent state, on the other hand, would emit no radiation at leading order in the coupling. This leads us to the conclusion that the instantaneous radiation calculated in the literature corresponds not to the oscillon's decay, but rather to its relaxation from a coherent state to a lower-energy, squeezed coherent state, which then radiates much more slowly. As a result, the lifetime of the quantum oscillon is enhanced by an inverse power of the coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic effective potential of the bumblebee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly obtain the nonrelativistic Breit potential in the bumblebee model arising in the weak gravity limit of the metric-affine bumblebee gravity, coupled to the spinor matter. In this theory, in the lower (second) order in the small coupling constant $\xi$ (and the second order in the LV vector $\beta_{\mu}$) it demonstrates the $1/r$ asymptotics, which naturally corresponds to the massless character of the theory, while higher orders in $\xi$ yield anisotropic modifications of the Coulomb potential due to the Lorentz symmetry breaking. For the lower-order modification of the effective potential, we calculate LV corrections to energy levels of the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of interacting primordial inhomogeneities: de-squeezing and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit. Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Elastic Kink-Meson Scattering in the $\Phi^4$ Double-Well Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the leading order amplitude and probability for the elastic scattering of an elementary meson and a kink in the $\phi^4$ double-well model. Classically, the kink is reflectionless, and so the leading contribution arises at one loop. At this order, the scattering amplitude exhibits a pole when the incoming meson energy is twice the shape mode energy, corresponding to the excitation of an unstable resonance with the twice excited shape mode. We expect that higher order corrections will give this resonance a width equal to the inverse of the known lifetime of this unstable excitation.</description>

      <title>From Diamond Gaugings to Dualisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that coupling two six-dimensional holomorphic Chern-Simons theories generates gaugings throughout the twistor-space diamond relating 6d hCS, 4d self-dual Yang-Mills, 4d Chern-Simons, and 2d integrable models. In previous work this mechanism was demonstrated only in a special case, leaving its general status unclear. By reformulating the construction in the language of Cartan geometry, we expose the underlying gauge structure and show that the argument extends to generic choices of meromorphic data. We then apply this to the pole structure that yields the well-studied $\lambda$-deformations of the WZW model. The coupled 6d system indeed induces gaugings of the associated $\lambda$-models, but necessarily introduces Lagrange multipliers enforcing flatness of the gauged connection. The resulting two-dimensional theories are therefore non-Abelian dualisations rather than ordinary gauged $\lambda$-models.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories for UV completions of graviton scattering from polynomial boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study graviton scattering amplitudes. Assuming they are UV completed by a theory of weakly coupled massive higher spins, we demonstrate that the UV completion must possess infinitely many Regge trajectories, and thus they are forced to have a stringy spectrum. We extend and simplify a previous proof by some of us for open-string like states to the case of external gravitons. In the present new proof, we trace the need for infinitely many trajectories to the constraint of polynomial boundedness, ultimately tied to causality. We further present numerical results based on the stringy ansatz of H\"aring-Zhiboedov, which illustrates how single-trajectory-like solutions actually emerge as extremal solutions of numerical bootstrap. In our numerics, these trajectories curiously show up as numerically very large \textit{sister} trajectories. We provide solid evidence that the solutions are spurious as they appear to admit a divergent limit for infinite ansatz size.</description>

      <title>Three-loop pentagonal Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a cutting-edge bootstrap method, we analytically compute the three-loop pentagonal Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. This object is conjectured to coincide with the maximally transcendental part of the four-loop five-point all-plus amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory. Our starting point is an ansatz that encodes the known leading singularities of this object, as well as the relevant function space. The latter has become available only recently, thanks to an analytic computation of all three-loop five-point planar massless Feynman integrals. We determine the coefficients in the ansatz by imposing physical constraints. This includes a near-collinear expansion, which so far has not been applied to this observable. Taken together, the constraints allow us to uniquely determine the symbol of the answer. We verify the symbol result by an independent integral reduction calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies of a quantum field theory (QFT) constitute fundamental non-perturbatively robust data. In this paper we extract anomalies of 5D superconformal field theories (SCFTs) directly from the underlying extra-dimensional geometry. We show that all of this information can be efficiently extracted from extra-dimensional $\eta$-invariants, bypassing previously established approaches based on computationally cumbersome blowup / resolution techniques. We illustrate these considerations for 5D SCFTs engineered in M-theory by non-compact geometries $X=\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ with finite subgroup $\Gamma\subset SU(3)$, where the anomalies are determined by the $\eta$-invariants of the asymptotic boundary $\partial X=S^5/\Gamma$. Our results apply equally to Abelian and non-Abelian $\Gamma$, as well as isolated and non-isolated singularities. In the setting of non-isolated singularities we further analyze the interplay of anomaly structures across different strata of the singular locus. Our considerations extend readily to backgrounds which are not global orbifolds, as well as those which do not preserve supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the $\Box^2$ Higher-Derivative Operator Class for Universal Vacuum-Energy Cancellations and Higgs Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of local, Lorentz-invariant, and Hermitian field theories, we investigate the classification of dimension-6 operators that facilitate the dynamical cancellation of vacuum-energy divergences. We demonstrate that the operator class based on the $\Box^2$ d'Alembertian is uniquely singled out by the requirement of universal power-divergence subtraction across all spin sectors. By explicitly evaluating the modified propagators and one-loop vacuum integrals, we show that only this structure consistently removes $\Lambda^4$ and $m^2\Lambda^2$ terms while preserving gauge covariance. Adopting the Real-Time Negative-Norm Prescription (RTNNP) as a consistent contour selection, we find that the higher-derivative Lee--Wick (HDLW) structure leads to a finite, calculable Higgs mass correction. Our results suggest a phenomenologically preferred scale of $M \approx 11.3$ TeV, offering a predictive and structurally motivated resolution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Creation of spin-3/2 dark matter via cosmological gravitational particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.</description>

      <title>Double-trace instability of BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the linear stability of rotating BTZ black holes under massive scalar field perturbations with double-trace boundary conditions. While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Fermion Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma (with Applications to Neutron Stars)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal field theory with fermion fields of any kind for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also average angular momentum. This extends a previous study that focused on scalar fields, to all fermion-scalar theories. Both Dirac and Majorana fermions and both Dirac and Majorana masses are covered. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that any discrepancy between an object's inertial and gravitational masses, leading to a violation of the equivalence principle, arises from the nature of its internal constituents and their interactions. We show here that the difference can instead be a function of the distance of the object from a gravitating body, and suggest ways of testing this, illustrating side-by-side a covariant framework for the same.</description>

      <title>Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17024v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Gaussian White Noise in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Realism and Ontology in Quantum Mechanics and String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities in physics have challenged traditional forms of scientific realism by undermining the idea that theories describe a unique underlying ontology. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on scientific realism that responds to this challenge. We argue that while realist commitment remains appropriate at the level of a theory's full formal structure, ontological commitment should be treated as tied to specific empirical contexts rather than to a fixed, real ontology. Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a "compression algorithm" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment. To clarify the stakes of this distinction, we contrast our approach with common core realism, which locates ontology in the invariant structure shared by dual models. Focusing on dualities in quantum mechanics and string theory, we show how our view accommodates ontological pluralism while preserving a robust form of structural realism.</description>

      <title>Modelling financial time series with $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory with inhomogeneous couplings and explicit symmetry-breaking to model an ensemble of financial time series from the S$\&amp;$P 500 index. The continuum nature of the $\phi^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $\phi^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory could be used to build investment strategies and the possible intuitions that the QFT operations of dimensional compactification and renormalization can provide for financial modelling.</description>

We initiate the study of quantum simulations of the models, both in classical simulators and on quantum devices implemented using superconducting qubits. We point out subtleties in the quantum simulations of highly chaotic systems, which should be addressed in the future search for quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate all three-loop, five-point, massless planar Feynman integral families in the dimensional regularization scheme. This is a new milestone in Feynman integral computations. The analysis covers four distinct families of Feynman integrals for this configuration, for all of which we derive the canonical differential equations. Our results also confirm a prediction on the three-loop five-point alphabet. The boundary values are analytically determined. Using these differential equations, the integrals can be evaluated to high precision efficiently. Our work establishes the foundation for next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the production of three massless final states, as well as corresponding bootstrap studies in gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for enlarging the construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded classical Toda theory from the class of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie algebras to the class of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebras. This scheme is applied to derive a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extension of the super-Liouville equation based on a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extension of $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2).$ The mathematical tools employed in this work are a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded version of the zero-curvature formalism and of the Polyakov's soldering procedure. It is demonstrated that both methods yield the same $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded super-Liouville equation. An algebraic construction of solutions to the resulting equations is also presented, together with their B\"acklund transformations. Furthermore, three distinct new $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the super-Virasoro algebra are obtained via Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW currents defined for $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-$\mathfrak{osp}(1|2).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent rapid development of complexity theory applied to quantum mechanical processes we present the complete derivation of Nielsen's complexity of unitaries belonging to the representations of oscillator group. Our approach is based on the observation that the whole problem refers to the structure of the underlying group. The questions concerning the complexity of particular unitaries are solved by lifting the abstract structure to the operator level by considering the relevant unitary representation. For the class of right-invariant metrics obeying natural invariance condition we solve the geodesic equations on oscillator group. The solution is given explicitly in terms of elementary functions. Imposing the boundary conditions yield a transcendental equation and the length of the geodesic is given in terms of the solutions to the latter. Since the unitary irreducible representations of oscillator group are classified this allows us to compute, at least in principle, the complexity of any unitary operator belonging to the representation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, equivalence principle, and HBAR entropy, in a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum information and thermodynamic properties of a new bumblebee black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking by analyzing near-horizon physics through complementary quantum probes. We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of these lecture notes is devoted to an introduction to the theory of exact WKB analysis for second-order Schr\"odinger-type ordinary differential equations. It reviews the construction of the WKB solution, Borel summability, connection formulas, and their application to direct monodromy problems.
  In the second part, we discuss recent developments in applying exact WKB analysis to the study of Painlev\'e equations. By combining exact WKB analysis with topological recursion, it becomes possible to explicitly compute the monodromy of linear differential equations associated with Painlev\'e equations, assuming Borel summability and other conditions. Furthermore, by using isomonodromy deformations (integrability of the Painlev\'e equations), the resurgent structure of the $\tau$-function and partition function is analyzed.
  These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school, ``Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)'' in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Networks as the fundamental constituents of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rotating black holes beyond general relativity in the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR) with black hole (BH) spectroscopy requires accurate and flexible methods for computing their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories. We find that the frequencies computed by the WKB method in theories beyond GR have better accuracy than the measurement errors for GW250114, the event with the highest ringdown signal-to-noise ratio observed to date.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and the Limits of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A necessary condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that squeezed vacua -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the semiclassicality criterion.</description>

      <title>Trails of clouds in binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.</description>

      <title>Relative R\'enyi Entropy Under Local Quenches in 2D CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relative R\'enyi entropy (RRE) under local quenches in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on rational CFTs (RCFTs) and holographic CFTs. In RCFTs, the RRE evolves as a monotonic function over time, depending on finite-dimensional matrices. It is sometimes symmetric, prompting an exploration of its relation to the trace squared distance. We also observe that relative entropy can fail to distinguish between operators, as it only captures information entering/exiting the subsystem. In holographic CFTs, an analytic continuation of the RRE reveals insights into the entanglement wedge, offering a new perspective on bulk geometry in AdS/CFT. Our results deepen the understanding of quantum information measures in RCFTs and holographic CFTs, highlighting connections to distinguishability and bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we demonstrate, using several regression techniques, that the remaining independent Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds and five-folds can be machine learned from $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$. Consequently, we combine the Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$ from the complete intersection Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds into a single dataset. We then implement various classification algorithms on this dataset. For example, Gaussian process and naive Bayes classifiers both achieve $100\%$ accuracy in binary classification between three-folds and four-folds. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a special corner is identified in the Calabi-Yau four-fold landscape (characterized by $15 \leq h^{1,1} \leq 30$ and $95 \leq h^{2,1} \leq 100$) during multiclass classification. Furthermore, the highest accuracy $1.00000$, in classifying Calabi-Yau three-folds, four-folds, and five-folds is obtained using the naive Bayes classifier.</description>

      <title>Observables and Unconstrained Spin Tensor Dynamics in General Relativity from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous Letter, we showed that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. In this paper, we provide further details on the physics of these additional degrees of freedom, whose commutation relations and Poisson brackets are inherited from the underlying Lorentz symmetry, and on their consequence on observables. In particular, we give the waveform at leading order in Newton's constant and up to second order in the components of the spin tensor, and the conservative impulse, boost and spin kick, exhibiting spin magnitude change, through next-to-leading-order in Newton's constant and third order in the components of the spin tensor. We provide explicit examples -- a Newtonian two-particle bound system and a certain black-hole solution in an exotic matter-coupled gravitational theory -- that exhibit these degrees of freedom and are described by our four-dimensional and worldline field theories. We also discuss connections between these degrees of freedom and dynamical worldline multipole moments. We construct effective two-body Hamiltonians, we demonstrate explicitly that the extra degrees of freedom beyond the spin vector are necessary to describe the complete dynamics, and we explicitly remove certain unphysical singularities. Moreover, we show that the previously proposed eikonal (or radial action) formula correctly captures observables derived from the classical Hamiltonian. Finally, we comment on possible descriptions of the additional degrees of freedom from the perspective of Goldstone's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lectures we detail the interplay between the low-energy dynamics of quantum field theories with four supercharges and the exact WKB analysis. This exposition may be the first comprehensive account of this connection and includes new arguments and results.
  The lectures start with the introduction of massive two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and their spectra of BPS solitons. We place these theories in a two-dimensional cigar background with supersymmetric boundary conditions labelled by a phase $\zeta = e^{i \vartheta}$, while turning on the two-dimensional $\Omega$-background with parameter~$\epsilon$. We show that the resulting partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ can be characterized as the Borel-summed solution, in the direction $\vartheta$, to an associated Schr\"odinger equation. The partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ is locally constant in the phase $\vartheta$ and jumps across phases $\vartheta_\textrm{BPS}$ associated with the BPS solitons. Since these jumps are non-perturbative in the parameter~$\epsilon$, we refer to $Z^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ as the non-perturbative partition function for the original two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. We completely determine this partition function $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ in two classes of examples, Landau-Ginzburg models and gauged linear sigma models, and show that $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ encodes the well-known vortex partition function at a special phase $\vartheta_\textrm{FN}$ associated with the presence of self-solitons. This analysis generalizes to four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the $\frac{1}{2} \Omega$-background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the computation of reduction coefficients for multi loop Feynman integrals using generating functions constructed within the Baikov representation. Compared with traditional Feynman rules, the Baikov formalism offers a more structured and transparent framework, especially well suited for analyzing the reduction problem. We emphasize that, in a variety of nontrivial cases including several one loop and selected multi loop examples the generating functions can be explicitly computed in closed form, often involving hypergeometric or elementary functions. These analytic expressions signifi cantly simplify the determination of reduction coefficients and enhance their interpretability. The results demonstrate the practicality and potential of this approach, suggesting that the use of generating functions within the Baikov representation can serve as a powerful and flexible tool in modern Feynman integral reduction, even though its full scope for generic multi-loop topologies remains to be explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic (NR) limit of HSZ theory, a higher-derivative theory of gravity with exact and manifest T-duality invariance. Since the theory can be formulated using the generalized metric formalism, the HSZ Lagrangian remains convergent to all orders in derivatives when taking the NR limit. In this work, we analyze the three-derivative corrections to the symmetry transformations of the fields in the NR case, as well as the terms in the four-derivative action depending on the b-field. Interestingly, the corrections to the metric degrees of freedom cannot be fully trivialized, as in the relativistic case, in order to preserve the convergence of the theory. As HSZ theory interpolates order by order between heterotic and bosonic string theories, the results of this work can be interpreted as a truncation of the four-derivative structure of heterotic supergravity in the NR limit.</description>

Abstract: We propose a bosonic string dual to large $N$ chiral Yang-Mills in two dimensions at finite 't Hooft coupling. The worldsheet theory is a $\beta$-$\gamma$ system deformed by a chiral Polchinski-Strominger term. We reproduce the partition function on a torus, cylinder three-point amplitudes, and the area law for Wilson loops. We also present candidate string duals to symmetric product orbifolds for general seed CFTs with $c&lt;24$ and their $T\bar{T}$-, $J\bar{T}$-deformations. The results hint at interrelations among confining, nonrelativistic and matrix strings, and AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Five-loop Anomalous Dimensions of Cubic Scalar Theory from Operator Product Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the $\phi^Q$ operator in six-dimensional cubic scalar theory. The renormalization analysis is carried out within the framework of the Operator Product Expansion method, while the ultraviolet divergences of Feynman integrals are evaluated using the graphical function method. Inspired by the intrinsic connection between Wilson coefficients and anomalous dimensions, an algorithm was proposed recently, which provides a practical and systematic framework for calculating the anomalous dimensions of masses, fields, and composite operators, with broad potential applicability to generic quantum field theories. Notably, the HyperlogProcedures package, developed based on the graphical function method, enables the computation of two-point propagator-type integrals, derived herein for capturing ultraviolet divergences, to very high loop orders. With these advanced techniques, we have successfully computed the anomalous dimensions of the $\phi^Q$ operator up to five loops. Furthermore, we present a large $N$ expansion of the scaling dimensions at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, extended to the $1/N^5$ order. This computation sets a new loop-order record for the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic scalar theory, while further validating the efficiency and versatility of the proposed algorithm in renormalization analyses.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates holographic timelike entanglement entropy in higher curvature gravity, with a particular focus on Lovelock theories and on the role of excited states. For strip subsystems, higher-curvature terms are found to affect the imaginary part of the entropy in a dimension-dependent manner, while excited states contribute solely to the real part. For the cases analyzed, spacelike and timelike entanglement entropies exhibit proportional relations: vacuum contributions differ by universal phase factors, while excitation contributions are linked by dimension-dependent rational coefficients. For hyperbolic subsystems, the timelike entanglement entropy computed via complex extremal surfaces is shown to agree with results obtained through analytic continuation, with imaginary contributions appearing in all dimensions. Higher-curvature corrections are explicitly calculated in five- and $(d+1)$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, illustrating the applicability of the complex surface prescription to general Lovelock corrections. These results provide a controlled setting to examine the influence of higher-curvature interactions on holographic timelike entanglement entropy, and clarify its relation to vacuum and excited-state contributions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of Continuous Symmetries from Topological Defect Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the 't Hooft anomaly of a quantum field theory with continuous flavor symmetry can be detected from rearrangements of the topological defect webs implementing the global symmetry in general spacetime dimension, which is concretized in 2D by the F-moves of the defect lines. Via dualizing the defects to flat background gauge field configurations, we characterize the 't Hooft anomaly by various cohomological data of the symmetry group, where the cohomology of Lie groups with discrete topology plays the central role. We find that an extra dimension emerges naturally as a consequence of the mathematical description of the 't Hooft anomaly in the case of flat gauging.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the bulk flat space limit in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flat space limit of scalar bulk fields in AdS is discussed within a Lorentzian canonical quantization setup tailored to describe AdS state preparation and to extract the flat S-matrix dynamics. We discuss how the algebraic \`{I}n\"on\"u-Wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. We develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk AdS scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. Flat space massive particle states are built out of the AdS primary together with AdS boosted wave functions. We compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the Lorentz group. In this same limit the original AdS descendants become null states. We also argue how the flat space S-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. To obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. We comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the AdS operator. We discuss some of the puzzles attached to these.</description>

Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops in ABJM theory reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new technique for computing supersymmetric Wilson loops in the ABJM theory via supersymmetric localization, valid for arbitrary values of the rank of the gauge group $N$ and the Chern-Simons level $k$. The approach relies on an operator representation of the Wilson loops within the Fermi gas formalism in terms of the resolvent of a certain integral operator previously encountered in the computation of the ABJM partition function on the round three-sphere. By deriving a set of nontrivial relations for this resolvent, we obtain exact expressions for the generating functions of Wilson loops in terms of the partition function. For large $k$, these expressions reproduce the weak-coupling expansion of the Wilson loops, and in the large-$N$ limit at fixed $k$ they match previously obtained high-precision numerical results. This analysis also resolves the longstanding discrepancy between numerical data and the semiclassical expression for the $1/6$ BPS Wilson loop.</description>

Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows are known to be highly expressive and flexible, which allows for easier incorporation of large symmetries and makes them a powerful computational tool for lattice field theories. Building on previous work, we present a general continuous normalizing flow architecture for matrix Lie groups that is equivariant under group transformations. We apply this to lattice gauge theories in two dimensions as a proof of principle and demonstrate competitive performance, showing its potential as a tool for future lattice computations.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Einstein--Maxwell--phantom spacetime: Instabilities of charged Ellis--Bronnikov wormholes and quasinormal modes of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phantom scalar fields, as a viable candidate for dark energy, have been instrumental in eliminating spacetime singularities and constructing wormholes and regular black holes. We investigate the Einstein-Maxwell-phantom (EMP) framework, in which the Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes can be charged and regular black holes can be admitted. While the previous study has shown the stability of EMP wormholes under massless scalar field perturbations, we further perform a comprehensive linear analysis of the EMP spacetime through gravito-electromagnetic field perturbations in the axial sector and phantom scalar field perturbations under an approximate treatment in the polar sector. Our analyses of effective potentials and finite difference time profiles reveal the linear instability of EMP wormholes. In the black hole scenario, the quasinormal spectra of Type I black holes, where the matrix-valued direct integration method and the Prony method are used, recover those of general relativity (GR) when the scalar charge goes to zero. Finally, by introducing the concepts of generalized specific charge and mixing angle, we quantify how the relative contributions between the phantom scalar and the electromagnetic fields modify the quasinormal spectra, and we assess the prospects for detecting spectral deviations between the EMP theory and GR in gravitational wave observation.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Topological Stabilization via Higgs and $Z$-Boson Mediated Repulsions in Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify two distinct repulsive mechanisms in the Cho-Maison monopole-antimonopole pair (MAP) configuration. Our results show that the Higgs-mediated repulsion exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on both topological charge and Higgs self-coupling, confirming its topological origin while revealing a mass-controlled range transition that deviates from the exponential form of a Yukawa potential. Simultaneously, the $Z$-boson field generates localized repulsive cores of radius $R_c\approx0.8\,m_W^{-1}$, consistent with the weak interaction scale. The collaborative effect of these mechanisms -- operating in different physics regimes -- counteracts the magnetic attraction, establishing a stabilization paradigm for the Cho-Maison MAP that extends naturally to other topological solitons in the Standard Model and various systems described by effective field theories.</description>

      <title>The 3D index and Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Holes from Proper-Time flow in Quantum Gravity and their Quasinormal modes, Shadow and Hawking radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a class of regular black holes from the proper-time renormalization group approach to asymptotically safe gravity. A central challenge is the robustness of physical predictions to the regularization scheme. We address this by computing key observables for our quantum-corrected black holes, which are non-singular and asymptotically Schwarzschild. We calculate the quasinormal mode spectrum, finding significant deviations from the classical case. The Hawking radiation spectrum is strongly suppressed, implying a slower evaporation rate and relaxed constraints on primordial black holes as dark matter. Shadows and ISCO radii remain consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that the singularity resolution and its primary observational implications are robust physical outcomes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first analysis of traversable wormhole solutions within the framework
  of Einstein-aether theory. We show that the corresponding field equations admit three
  distinct wormhole geometries, obtained by adopting three different classes of combinations
  for the aether coupling constants. We examine the null and weak energy conditions for
  three types of wormhole shape functions. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to Einstein
  gravity, by choosing appropriate parameter values, wormhole geometries can satisfy the
  energy conditions at the wormhole throat. We also nd that in one class, wormholes
  can satisfy the energy conditions not only at the wormhole throat but also throughout
  the entire spacetime. Furthermore, the requirement of energy condition satisfaction,
  imposes some constraints on the values of aether coupling constants. By comparing these
  constraints with those previously obtained from theoretical and observational analyses,
  we nd that the satisfaction of energy conditions put more stringent limits on the allowed
  values of the aether couplings.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition. This effect can lift the generated baryon asymmetry by several orders, and make it possible to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe with a CPV in the fermion sector far beyond the limitation of the electron dipole moment.</description>
