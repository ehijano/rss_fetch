      <title>Jailbreaking Large Language Models Against Moderation Guardrails via Cipher Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically harmless but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted prompts known as ``jailbreaks'', which can bypass protective measures and induce harmful behavior. Recent advancements in LLMs have incorporated moderation guardrails that can filter outputs, which trigger processing errors for certain malicious questions. Existing red-teaming benchmarks often neglect to include questions that trigger moderation guardrails, making it difficult to evaluate jailbreak effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce JAMBench, a harmful behavior benchmark designed to trigger and evaluate moderation guardrails. JAMBench involves 160 manually crafted instructions covering four major risk categories at multiple severity levels. Furthermore, we propose a jailbreak method, JAM (Jailbreak Against Moderation), designed to attack moderation guardrails using jailbreak prefixes to bypass input-level filters and a fine-tuned shadow model functionally equivalent to the guardrail model to generate cipher characters to bypass output-level filters. Our extensive experiments on four LLMs demonstrate that JAM achieves higher jailbreak success ($\sim$ $\times$ 19.88) and lower filtered-out rates ($\sim$ $\times$ 1/6) than baselines.</description>

      <title>SECURE: Benchmarking Generative Large Language Models for Cybersecurity Advisory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in cybersecurity applications but have also caused lower confidence due to problems like hallucinations and a lack of truthfulness. Existing benchmarks provide general evaluations but do not sufficiently address the practical and applied aspects of LLM performance in cybersecurity-specific tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the SECURE (Security Extraction, Understanding \&amp; Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. SECURE includes six datasets focussed on the Industrial Control System sector to evaluate knowledge extraction, understanding, and reasoning based on industry-standard sources. Our study evaluates seven state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts, and offer recommendations for improving LLMs reliability as cyber advisory tools.</description>

      <title>Is My Data in Your Retrieval Database? Membership Inference Attacks Against Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in natural language processing. However, their reliance on data stored in a retrieval database, which may contain proprietary or sensitive information, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, an attacker may be able to infer whether a certain text passage appears in the retrieval database by observing the outputs of the RAG system, an attack known as a Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Despite the significance of this threat, MIAs against RAG systems have yet remained under-explored. This study addresses this gap by introducing an efficient and easy-to-use method for conducting MIA against RAG systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using two benchmark datasets and multiple generative models, showing that the membership of a document in the retrieval database can be efficiently determined through the creation of an appropriate prompt in both black-box and gray-box settings. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing security countermeasures in deployed RAG systems to protect the privacy and security of retrieval databases.</description>

      <title>Hiding Your Awful Online Choices Made More Efficient and Secure: A New Privacy-Aware Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are an integral part of online platforms that recommend new content to users with similar interests. However, they demand a considerable amount of user activity data where, if the data is not adequately protected, constitute a critical threat to the user privacy. Privacy-aware recommender systems enable protection of such sensitive user data while still maintaining a similar recommendation accuracy compared to the traditional non-private recommender systems. However, at present, the current privacy-aware recommender systems suffer from a significant trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency. For instance, it is well known that architectures that rely purely on cryptographic primitives offer the most robust privacy guarantees, however, they suffer from substantial computational and network overhead. Thus, it is crucial to improve this trade-off for better performance. This paper presents a novel privacy-aware recommender system that combines privacy-aware machine learning algorithms for practical scalability and efficiency with cryptographic primitives like Homomorphic Encryption and Multi-Party Computation - without assumptions like trusted-party or secure hardware - for solid privacy guarantees. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our approach results in time and memory gains by three orders of magnitude compared to using cryptographic primitives in a standalone for constructing a privacy-aware recommender system. Furthermore, for the first time our method makes it feasible to compute private recommendations for datasets containing 100 million entries, even on memory-constrained low-power SOC (System on Chip) devices.</description>

      <title>Phantom: General Trigger Attacks on Retrieval Augmented Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in chatbot applications, enabling developers to adapt and personalize the LLM output without expensive training or fine-tuning. RAG systems use an external knowledge database to retrieve the most relevant documents for a given query, providing this context to the LLM generator. While RAG achieves impressive utility in many applications, its adoption to enable personalized generative models introduces new security risks. In this work, we propose new attack surfaces for an adversary to compromise a victim's RAG system, by injecting a single malicious document in its knowledge database. We design Phantom, general two-step attack framework against RAG augmented LLMs. The first step involves crafting a poisoned document designed to be retrieved by the RAG system within the top-k results only when an adversarial trigger, a specific sequence of words acting as backdoor, is present in the victim's queries. In the second step, a specially crafted adversarial string within the poisoned document triggers various adversarial attacks in the LLM generator, including denial of service, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors. We demonstrate our attacks on multiple LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama.</description>

      <title>SoK: Public Blockchain Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain's decentralization, transparency, and tamper-resistance properties have facilitated the system's use in various application fields. However, the low throughput and high confirmation latency hinder the widespread adoption of Blockchain. Many solutions have been proposed to address these issues, including first-layer solutions (or on-chain solutions) and second-layer solutions (or off-chain solutions). Among the proposed solutions, the blockchain sharding system is the most scalable one, where the nodes in the network are divided into several groups. The nodes in different shards work in parallel to validate the transactions and add them to the blocks, and in such a way, the throughput increases significantly. However, previous works have not adequately summarized the latest achievements in blockchain sharding, nor have they fully showcased its state-of-the-art. Our study provides a systemization of knowledge of public blockchain sharding, including the core components of sharding systems, challenges, limitations, and mechanisms of the latest sharding protocols. We also compare their performance and discuss current constraints and future research directions.</description>

      <title>All Your Tokens are Belong to Us: Demystifying Address Verification Vulnerabilities in Solidity Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ethereum, the practice of verifying the validity of the passed addresses is a common practice, which is a crucial step to ensure the secure execution of smart contracts. Vulnerabilities in the process of address verification can lead to great security issues, and anecdotal evidence has been reported by our community. However, this type of vulnerability has not been well studied. To fill the void, in this paper, we aim to characterize and detect this kind of emerging vulnerability. We design and implement AVVERIFIER, a lightweight taint analyzer based on static EVM opcode simulation. Its three-phase detector can progressively rule out false positives and false negatives based on the intrinsic characteristics. Upon a well-established and unbiased benchmark, AVVERIFIER can improve efficiency 2 to 5 times than the SOTA while maintaining a 94.3% precision and 100% recall. After a large-scale evaluation of over 5 million Ethereum smart contracts, we have identified 812 vulnerable smart contracts that were undisclosed by our community before this work, and 348 open source smart contracts were further verified, whose largest total value locked is over $11.2 billion. We further deploy AVVERIFIER as a real-time detector on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, and the results suggest that AVVERIFIER can raise timely warnings once contracts are deployed.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Analytics with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative graph analysis across multiple institutions is becoming increasingly popular. Realistic examples include social network analysis across various social platforms, financial transaction analysis across multiple banks, and analyzing the transmission of infectious diseases across multiple hospitals. We define the federated graph analytics, a new problem for collaborative graph analytics under differential privacy. Although differentially private graph analysis has been widely studied, it fails to achieve a good tradeoff between utility and privacy in federated scenarios, due to the limited view of local clients and overlapping information across multiple subgraphs. Motivated by this, we first propose a federated graph analytic framework, named FEAT, which enables arbitrary downstream common graph statistics while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, we introduce an optimized framework based on our proposed degree-based partition algorithm, called FEAT+, which improves the overall utility by leveraging the true local subgraphs. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our FEAT and FEAT+ significantly outperform the baseline approach by approximately one and four orders of magnitude, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bi-Directional Transformers vs. word2vec: Discovering Vulnerabilities in Lifted Compiled Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities within compiled binaries is challenging due to lost high-level code structures and other factors such as architectural dependencies, compilers, and optimization options. To address these obstacles, this research explores vulnerability detection by using natural language processing (NLP) embedding techniques with word2vec, BERT, and RoBERTa to learn semantics from intermediate representation (LLVM) code. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were trained on embeddings from encoders created using approximately 118k LLVM functions from the Juliet dataset. This study is pioneering in its comparison of word2vec models with multiple bidirectional transformer (BERT, RoBERTa) embeddings built using LLVM code to train neural networks to detect vulnerabilities in compiled binaries. word2vec Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) models achieved 92.3% validation accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, outperforming word2vec Skip-Gram, BERT, and RoBERTa. This suggests that complex contextual NLP embeddings may not provide advantages over simpler word2vec models for this task when a limited number (e.g. 118K) of data samples are used to train the bidirectional transformer-based models. The comparative results provide novel insights into selecting optimal embeddings for learning compiler-independent semantic code representations to advance machine learning detection of vulnerabilities in compiled binaries.</description>

      <title>Query Provenance Analysis for Robust and Efficient Query-based Black-box Attack Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-based black-box attacks have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning systems, where adversaries can manipulate the input queries to generate adversarial examples that can cause misclassification of the model. To counter these attacks, researchers have proposed Stateful Defense Models (SDMs) for detecting adversarial query sequences and rejecting queries that are "similar" to the history queries. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SDMs (e.g., BlackLight and PIHA) have shown great effectiveness in defending against these attacks. However, recent studies have shown that they are vulnerable to Oracle-guided Adaptive Rejection Sampling (OARS) attacks, which is a stronger adaptive attack strategy. It can be easily integrated with existing attack algorithms to evade the SDMs by generating queries with fine-tuned direction and step size of perturbations utilizing the leaked decision information from the SDMs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Query Provenance Analysis (QPA), for more robust and efficient SDMs. QPA encapsulates the historical relationships among queries as the sequence feature to capture the fundamental difference between benign and adversarial query sequences. To utilize the query provenance, we propose an efficient query provenance analysis algorithm with dynamic management. We evaluate QPA compared with two baselines, BlackLight and PIHA, on four widely used datasets with six query-based black-box attack algorithms. The results show that QPA outperforms the baselines in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency on both non-adaptive and adaptive attacks. Specifically, QPA reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of OARS to 4.08%, comparing to 77.63% and 87.72% for BlackLight and PIHA, respectively. Moreover, QPA also achieves 7.67x and 2.25x higher throughput than BlackLight and PIHA.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch Theorem for Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals and businesses have been significantly benefited by Large Language Models (LLMs) including PaLM, Gemini and ChatGPT in various ways. For example, LLMs enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable us to focus on more valuable tasks. Furthermore, LLMs possess the capacity to sift through extensive datasets, uncover underlying patterns, and furnish critical insights that propel the frontiers of technology and science. However, LLMs also pose privacy concerns. Users' interactions with LLMs may expose their sensitive personal or company information. A lack of robust privacy safeguards and legal frameworks could permit the unwarranted intrusion or improper handling of individual data, thereby risking infringements of privacy and the theft of personal identities. To ensure privacy, it is essential to minimize the dependency between shared prompts and private information. Various randomization approaches have been proposed to protect prompts' privacy, but they may incur utility loss compared to unprotected LLMs prompting. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the balance between the risk of privacy leakage and loss of utility when conducting effective protection mechanisms. The current study develops a framework for inferring privacy-protected Large Language Models (LLMs) and lays down a solid theoretical basis for examining the interplay between privacy preservation and utility. The core insight is encapsulated within a theorem that is called as the NFL (abbreviation of the word No-Free-Lunch) Theorem.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Method for Defending Against UAF Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread presence of Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities poses a serious threat to software security, with dangling pointers being considered the primary cause of these vulnerabilities. However, existing methods for defending against UAF vulnerabilities by eliminating dangling pointers need to interrupt the program's execution when encountering pointer assignment operations to look up the objects pointed to by the pointers and store the memory addresses of the pointers in a specific data structure. This makes these methods not lightweight. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach called LightDE. This method does not require storing the memory addresses of pointers or locating the objects pointed to by pointers during program execution. LightDE uses our proposed structure-sensitive pointer analysis method to determine the objects pointed to by pointers and stores the pointing relationships in the program's data segment during program compilation. Since LightDE only needs to check whether the pointers identified by the pointer analysis point to the released objects when the objects are released, LightDE is very lightweight. Our experimental results show that LightDE can effectively defend against UAF vulnerabilities, and the additional performance overhead it introduces is very low.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of S-boxes with Garbled Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garbling schemes are vital primitives for privacy-preserving protocols and secure two-party computation. This paper presents a projective garbling scheme that assigns $2^n$ values to wires in a circuit comprising XOR and unary projection gates. A generalization of FreeXOR allows the XOR of wires with $2^n$ values to be very efficient. We then analyze the performance of our scheme by evaluating substitution-permutation ciphers. Using our proposal, we measure high-speed evaluation of the ciphers with a moderately increased cost in garbling and bandwidth. Theoretical analysis suggests that for evaluating the nine examined ciphers, one can expect a 4- to 70-fold improvement in evaluation performance with, at most, a 4-fold increase in garbling cost and, at most, an 8-fold increase in communication cost compared to the Half-Gates (Zahur, Rosulek and Evans; Eurocrypt'15) and ThreeHalves (Rosulek and Roy; Crypto'21) garbling schemes. In an offline/online setting, such as secure function evaluation as a service, the circuit garbling and communication to the evaluator can proceed in the offline phase. Thus, our scheme offers a fast online phase. Furthermore, we present efficient Boolean circuits for the S-boxes of TWINE and Midori64 ciphers. To our knowledge, our formulas give the smallest number of AND gates for the S-boxes of these two ciphers.</description>

      <title>GANcrop: A Contrastive Defense Against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With heightened awareness of data privacy protection, Federated Learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method. However, the distributed nature of federated learning also provides opportunities for backdoor attacks, where attackers can guide the model to produce incorrect predictions without affecting the global model training process.
  This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in federated learning, named GANcrop. This approach leverages contrastive learning to deeply explore the disparities between malicious and benign models for attack identification, followed by the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to recover backdoor triggers and implement targeted mitigation strategies. Experimental findings demonstrate that GANcrop effectively safeguards against backdoor attacks, particularly in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining satisfactory model accuracy, showcasing its remarkable defensive efficacy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Access Control Approaches for Graph-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access control is the enforcement of the authorization policy, which defines subjects, resources, and access rights. Graph-structured data requires advanced, flexible, and fine-grained access control due to its complex structure as sequences of alternating vertices and edges. Several research works focus on protecting property graph-structured data, enforcing fine-grained access control, and proving the feasibility and applicability of their concept. However, they differ conceptually and technically. We select works from our systematic literature review on authorization and access control for different database models in addition to recent ones. Based on defined criteria, we exclude research works with different objectives, such as no protection of graph-structured data, graph models other than the property graph, coarse-grained access control approaches, or no application in a graph datastore (i.e., no proof-of-concept implementation). The latest version of the remaining works are discussed in detail in terms of their access control approach as well as authorization policy definition and enforcement. Finally, we analyze the strengths and limitations of the selected works and provide a comparison with respect to different aspects, including the base access control model, open/closed policy, negative permission support, and datastore-independent enforcement.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Pitfalls for Privacy Accounting of Subsampled Mechanisms under Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing tight privacy guarantees for the composition of subsampled differentially private mechanisms. Recent algorithms can numerically compute the privacy parameters to arbitrary precision but must be carefully applied.
  Our main contribution is to address two common points of confusion. First, some privacy accountants assume that the privacy guarantees for the composition of a subsampled mechanism are determined by self-composing the worst-case datasets for the uncomposed mechanism. We show that this is not true in general. Second, Poisson subsampling is sometimes assumed to have similar privacy guarantees compared to sampling without replacement. We show that the privacy guarantees may in fact differ significantly between the two sampling schemes. In particular, we give an example of hyperparameters that result in $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for Poisson subsampling and $\varepsilon &gt; 10$ for sampling without replacement. This occurs for some parameters that could realistically be chosen for DP-SGD.</description>

      <title>Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic, given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitations of applying existing MIA methods for copyright protection: the required access of internal U-nets and the choice of non-member datasets for evaluation. To address the above problems, we introduce a novel black-box membership inference attack method that operates without needing access to the model's internal U-net. We then construct a DALL-E generated dataset for a more comprehensive evaluation. We validate our method across various setups, and our experimental results outperform previous works.</description>

      <title>Visual-RolePlay: Universal Jailbreak Attack on MultiModal Large Language Models via Role-playing Image Characte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. To achieve this objective, it requires us to proactively discover the vulnerability of MLLMs by exploring the attack methods. Thus, structure-based jailbreak attacks, where harmful semantic content is embedded within images, have been proposed to mislead the models. However, previous structure-based jailbreak methods mainly focus on transforming the format of malicious queries, such as converting harmful content into images through typography, which lacks sufficient jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability. To address these limitations, we first introduce the concept of "Role-play" into MLLM jailbreak attacks and propose a novel and effective method called Visual Role-play (VRP). Specifically, VRP leverages Large Language Models to generate detailed descriptions of high-risk characters and create corresponding images based on the descriptions. When paired with benign role-play instruction texts, these high-risk character images effectively mislead MLLMs into generating malicious responses by enacting characters with negative attributes. We further extend our VRP method into a universal setup to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that VRP outperforms the strongest baseline, Query relevant and FigStep, by an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) margin of 14.3% across all models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Large Language Model-based Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks when fine-tuned on specific applications, leveraging their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities learned from vast amounts of data. However, these systems are exposed to substantial safety and security risks during the fine-tuning phase. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-enabled Decision-making systems (BALD), systematically exploring how such attacks can be introduced during the fine-tuning phase across various channels. Specifically, we propose three attack mechanisms and corresponding backdoor optimization methods to attack different components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection. Word injection embeds trigger words directly into the query prompt. Scenario manipulation occurs in the physical environment, where a high-level backdoor semantic scenario triggers the attack. Knowledge injection conducts backdoor attacks on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based LLM systems, strategically injecting word triggers into poisoned knowledge while ensuring the information remains factually accurate for stealthiness. We conduct extensive experiments with three popular LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2), using two datasets (HighwayEnv, nuScenes), and demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers and mechanisms. Finally, we critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approaches, highlight the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in decision-making tasks, and evaluate potential defenses to safeguard LLM-based decision making systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modality Jailbreak and Mismatched Attacks on Medical Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we redefine two types of attacks: mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack). Using our own constructed voluminous 3MAD dataset, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and novel attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks on four other state-of-the-art models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features are vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings. For further research and replication, anonymous access to our code is available at https://github.com/dirtycomputer/O2M_attack. Warning: Medical large model jailbreaking may generate content that includes unverified diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Always consult professional medical advice.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Blockchain-Enhanced Machine Unlearning: A Trustworthy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Detection of Language Model Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising way to detect LLM-generated text. To apply a watermark an LLM provider, given a secret key, augments generations with a signal that is later detectable by any party with the same key. Recent work has proposed three main families of watermarking schemes, two of which focus on the property of preserving the LLM distribution. This is motivated by it being a tractable proxy for maintaining LLM capabilities, but also by the idea that concealing a watermark deployment makes it harder for malicious actors to hide misuse by avoiding a certain LLM or attacking its watermark. Yet, despite much discourse around detectability, no prior work has investigated if any of these scheme families are detectable in a realistic black-box setting. We tackle this for the first time, developing rigorous statistical tests to detect the presence of all three most popular watermarking scheme families using only a limited number of black-box queries. We experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our methods on a range of schemes and a diverse set of open-source models. Our findings indicate that current watermarking schemes are more detectable than previously believed, and that obscuring the fact that a watermark was deployed may not be a viable way for providers to protect against adversaries. We further apply our methods to test for watermark presence behind the most popular public APIs: GPT4, Claude 3, Gemini 1.0 Pro, finding no strong evidence of a watermark at this point in time.</description>

      <title>Improved Generation of Adversarial Examples Against Safety-aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts to ensure large language models (LLMs) adhere to safety standards and produce harmless content, some successes have been achieved in bypassing these restrictions, known as jailbreak attacks against LLMs. Adversarial prompts generated using gradient-based methods exhibit outstanding performance in performing jailbreak attacks automatically. Nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of texts, the input gradient of LLMs struggles to precisely reflect the magnitude of loss change that results from token replacements in the prompt, leading to limited attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs, even in the white-box setting. In this paper, we explore a new perspective on this problem, suggesting that it can be alleviated by leveraging innovations inspired in transfer-based attacks that were originally proposed for attacking black-box image classification models. For the first time, we appropriate the ideologies of effective methods among these transfer-based attacks, i.e., Skip Gradient Method and Intermediate Level Attack, for improving the effectiveness of automatically generated adversarial examples against white-box LLMs. With appropriate adaptations, we inject these ideologies into gradient-based adversarial prompt generation processes and achieve significant performance gains without introducing obvious computational cost. Meanwhile, by discussing mechanisms behind the gains, new insights are drawn, and proper combinations of these methods are also developed. Our empirical results show that the developed combination achieves &gt;30% absolute increase in attack success rates compared with GCG for attacking the Llama-2-7B-Chat model on AdvBench.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic utility of spectral anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary data landscape characterized by multi-source data collection and third-party sharing, ensuring individual privacy stands as a critical concern. While various anonymization methods exist, their utility preservation and privacy guarantees remain challenging to quantify. In this work, we address this gap by studying the utility and privacy of the spectral anonymization (SA) algorithm, particularly in an asymptotic framework. Unlike conventional anonymization methods that directly modify the original data, SA operates by perturbing the data in a spectral basis and subsequently reverting them to their original basis. Alongside the original version $\mathcal{P}$-SA, employing random permutation transformation, we introduce two novel SA variants: $\mathcal{J}$-spectral anonymization and $\mathcal{O}$-spectral anonymization, which employ sign-change and orthogonal matrix transformations, respectively. We show how well, under some practical assumptions, these SA algorithms preserve the first and second moments of the original data. Our results reveal, in particular, that the asymptotic efficiency of all three SA algorithms in covariance estimation is exactly 50% when compared to the original data. To assess the applicability of these asymptotic results in practice, we conduct a simulation study with finite data and also evaluate the privacy protection offered by these algorithms using distance-based record linkage. Our research reveals that while no method exhibits clear superiority in finite-sample utility, $\mathcal{O}$-SA distinguishes itself for its exceptional privacy preservation, never producing identical records, albeit with increased computational complexity. Conversely, $\mathcal{P}$-SA emerges as a computationally efficient alternative, demonstrating unmatched efficiency in mean estimation.</description>

      <title>Universal Exact Compression of Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>How the Future Works at SOUPS: Analyzing Future Work Statements and Their Impact on Usable Security and Privacy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending knowledge by identifying and investigating valuable research questions and problems is a core function of research. Research publications often suggest avenues for future work to extend and build upon their results. Considering these suggestions can contribute to developing research ideas that build upon previous work and produce results that tie into existing knowledge. Usable security and privacy researchers commonly add future work statements to their publications. However, our community lacks an in-depth understanding of their prevalence, quality, and impact on future research.
  Our work aims to address this gap in the research literature. We reviewed all 27 papers from the 2019 SOUPS proceedings and analyzed their future work statements. Additionally, we analyzed 978 publications that cite any paper from SOUPS 2019 proceedings to assess their future work statements' impact. We find that most papers from the SOUPS 2019 proceedings include future work statements. However, they are often unspecific or ambiguous, and not always easy to find. Therefore, the citing publications often matched the future work statements' content thematically, but rarely explicitly acknowledged them, indicating a limited impact. We conclude with recommendations for the usable security and privacy community to improve the utility of future work statements by making them more tangible and actionable, and avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>BackdoorIndicator: Leveraging OOD Data for Proactive Backdoor Detection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a federated learning (FL) system, decentralized data owners (clients) could upload their locally trained models to a central server, to jointly train a global model. Malicious clients may plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing misclassification to a target class when encountering attacker-defined triggers. Existing backdoor defenses show inconsistent performance under different system and adversarial settings, especially when the malicious updates are made statistically close to the benign ones. In this paper, we first reveal the fact that planting subsequent backdoors with the same target label could significantly help to maintain the accuracy of previously planted backdoors, and then propose a novel proactive backdoor detection mechanism for FL named BackdoorIndicator, which has the server inject indicator tasks into the global model leveraging out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and then utilizing the fact that any backdoor samples are OOD samples with respect to benign samples, the server, who is completely agnostic of the potential backdoor types and target labels, can accurately detect the presence of backdoors in uploaded models, via evaluating the indicator tasks. We perform systematic and extensive empirical studies to demonstrate the consistently superior performance and practicality of BackdoorIndicator over baseline defenses, across a wide range of system and adversarial settings.</description>

      <title>RASE: Efficient Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation against Disclosure Attacks for IoTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing popular awareness of personal privacy raises the following quandary: what is the new paradigm for collecting and protecting the data produced by ever-increasing sensor devices. Most previous studies on co-design of data aggregation and privacy preservation assume that a trusted fusion center adheres to privacy regimes. Very recent work has taken steps towards relaxing the assumption by allowing data contributors to locally perturb their own data. Although these solutions withhold some data content to mitigate privacy risks, they have been shown to offer insufficient protection against disclosure attacks. Aiming at providing a more rigorous data safeguard for the Internet of Things (IoTs), this paper initiates the study of privacy-preserving data aggregation. We propose a novel paradigm (called RASE), which can be generalized into a 3-step sequential procedure, noise addition, followed by random permutation, and then parameter estimation. Specially, we design a differentially private randomizer, which carefully guides data contributors to obfuscate the truth. Then, a shuffler is employed to receive the noisy data from all data contributors. After that, it breaks the correct linkage between senders and receivers by applying a random permutation. The estimation phase involves using inaccurate data to calculate an approximate aggregate value. Extensive simulations are provided to explore the privacy-utility landscape of our RASE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Cryptography is one of the main candidates for Post-quantum Cryptography. Multivariate schemes are usually constructed by applying two secret affine invertible transformations $\mathcal S,\mathcal T$ to a set of multivariate polynomials $\mathcal{F}$ (often quadratic). The secret polynomials $\mathcal{F}$ posses a trapdoor that allows the legitimate user to find a solution of the corresponding system, while the public polynomials $\mathcal G=\mathcal S\circ\mathcal F\circ\mathcal T$ look like random polynomials. The polynomials $\mathcal G$ and $\mathcal F$ are said to be affine equivalent. In this article, we present a more general way of constructing a multivariate scheme by considering the CCZ equivalence, which has been introduced and studied in the context of vectorial Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>ACE: A Model Poisoning Attack on Contribution Evaluation Methods in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), a set of clients collaboratively train a machine learning model (called global model) without sharing their local training data. The local training data of clients is typically non-i.i.d. and heterogeneous, resulting in varying contributions from individual clients to the final performance of the global model. In response, many contribution evaluation methods were proposed, where the server could evaluate the contribution made by each client and incentivize the high-contributing clients to sustain their long-term participation in FL. Existing studies mainly focus on developing new metrics or algorithms to better measure the contribution of each client. However, the security of contribution evaluation methods of FL operating in adversarial environments is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first model poisoning attack on contribution evaluation methods in FL, termed ACE. Specifically, we show that any malicious client utilizing ACE could manipulate the parameters of its local model such that it is evaluated to have a high contribution by the server, even when its local training data is indeed of low quality. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of ACE. Theoretically, we show our design of ACE can effectively boost the malicious client's perceived contribution when the server employs the widely-used cosine distance metric to measure contribution. Empirically, our results show ACE effectively and efficiently deceive five state-of-the-art contribution evaluation methods. In addition, ACE preserves the accuracy of the final global models on testing inputs. We also explore six countermeasures to defend ACE. Our results show they are inadequate to thwart ACE, highlighting the urgent need for new defenses to safeguard the contribution evaluation methods in FL.</description>

      <title>Locking Machine Learning Models into Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Machine Learning models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed -- for example it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as Multi-Party Computation or Homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper we take a different approach and investigate feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap locking of machine learning models into specific hardware. We demonstrate that locking mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, such making models incompatible with quantisation, or tie the model's operation on specific characteristics of hardware, such as number of cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible work and latency overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in SNNs with Sparse Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention for their energy-efficient operations and biologically inspired structures, offering potential advantages over Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of energy efficiency and interpretability. Nonetheless, similar to ANNs, the robustness of SNNs remains a challenge, especially when facing adversarial attacks. Existing techniques, whether adapted from ANNs or specifically designed for SNNs, exhibit limitations in training SNNs or defending against strong attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the robustness of SNNs through gradient sparsity regularization. We observe that SNNs exhibit greater resilience to random perturbations compared to adversarial perturbations, even at larger scales. Motivated by this, we aim to narrow the gap between SNNs under adversarial and random perturbations, thereby improving their overall robustness. To achieve this, we theoretically prove that this performance gap is upper bounded by the gradient sparsity of the probability associated with the true label concerning the input image, laying the groundwork for a practical strategy to train robust SNNs by regularizing the gradient sparsity. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both image-based and event-based datasets. The results demonstrate notable improvements in the robustness of SNNs. Our work highlights the importance of gradient sparsity in SNNs and its role in enhancing robustness.</description>

      <title>Gradient Inversion of Federated Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are becoming defector generative models, which generate exceptionally high-resolution image data. Training effective diffusion models require massive real data, which is privately owned by distributed parties. Each data party can collaboratively train diffusion models in a federated learning manner by sharing gradients instead of the raw data. In this paper, we study the privacy leakage risk of gradient inversion attacks. First, we design a two-phase fusion optimization, GIDM, to leverage the well-trained generative model itself as prior knowledge to constrain the inversion search (latent) space, followed by pixel-wise fine-tuning. GIDM is shown to be able to reconstruct images almost identical to the original ones. Considering a more privacy-preserving training scenario, we then argue that locally initialized private training noise $\epsilon$ and sampling step t may raise additional challenges for the inversion attack. To solve this, we propose a triple-optimization GIDM+ that coordinates the optimization of the unknown data, $\epsilon$ and $t$. Our extensive evaluation results demonstrate the vulnerability of sharing gradient for data protection of diffusion models, even high-resolution images can be reconstructed with high quality.</description>

      <title>Private Mean Estimation with Person-Level Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each person holds multiple samples. Commonly referred to as the "user-level" setting, DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when all of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have $m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th moments, we show that
  \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d }{ \alpha m^{1/2} \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\]
  people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance $\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally efficient algorithms under approximate DP (with slightly degraded sample complexity) and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the well known noisy-clipped-mean approach, but the analysis for our setting requires new bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments random variables, and a new argument for bounding the bias introduced by clipping.</description>

      <title>Optimizing cnn-Bigru performance: Mish activation and comparative analysis with Relu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is currently extensively employed across a range of research domains. The continuous advancements in deep learning techniques contribute to solving intricate challenges. Activation functions (AF) are fundamental components within neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. By introducing non-linearities, AF empowers neural networks to model and adapt to the diverse and nuanced nature of real-world data, enhancing their ability to make accurate predictions across various tasks. In the context of intrusion detection, the Mish, a recent AF, was implemented in the CNN-BiGRU model, using three datasets: ASNM-TUN, ASNM-CDX, and HOGZILLA. The comparison with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), a widely used AF, revealed that Mish outperforms ReLU, showcasing superior performance across the evaluated datasets. This study illuminates the effectiveness of AF in elevating the performance of intrusion detection systems.</description>

      <title>SleeperNets: Universal Backdoor Poisoning Attacks Against Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an actively growing field that is seeing increased usage in real-world, safety-critical applications -- making it paramount to ensure the robustness of RL algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ``SleeperNets'' as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.</description>

      <title>Share Your Secrets for Privacy! Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in industrial applications, such as predictive maintenance and machine control. Critical challenges to address in manufacturing include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, to increase industry adaptability, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address those challenges and propose 'Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL' (STV), a novel framework that exhibits the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically partitioned data; ii) serverless forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for direct parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal hyperparameter tuning complexity. We conduct evaluations on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Our results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. They also show that our direct optimization can outperform centralized methods, which include state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also conduct a scalability analysis by examining the communication costs of direct and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two.

      <title>Large Language Model Sentinel: Advancing Adversarial Robustness by LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for defense, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Answer "Attacks" on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) showcase impressive reasoning capabilities when coupled with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, the robustness of this approach warrants further investigation. In this paper, we introduce a novel scenario termed preemptive answers, where the LLM obtains an answer before engaging in reasoning. This situation can arise inadvertently or induced by malicious users by prompt injection attacks. Experiments reveal that preemptive answers significantly impair the model's reasoning capability across various CoT methods and a broad spectrum of datasets. To bolster the robustness of reasoning, we propose two measures aimed at mitigating this issue to some extent.</description>

      <title>Improved Techniques for Optimization-Based Jailbreaking on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly developed, and a key component of their widespread deployment is their safety-related alignment. Many red-teaming efforts aim to jailbreak LLMs, where among these efforts, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack's success has led to a growing interest in the study of optimization-based jailbreaking techniques. Although GCG is a significant milestone, its attacking efficiency remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we present several improved (empirical) techniques for optimization-based jailbreaks like GCG. We first observe that the single target template of "Sure" largely limits the attacking performance of GCG; given this, we propose to apply diverse target templates containing harmful self-suggestion and/or guidance to mislead LLMs. Besides, from the optimization aspects, we propose an automatic multi-coordinate updating strategy in GCG (i.e., adaptively deciding how many tokens to replace in each step) to accelerate convergence, as well as tricks like easy-to-hard initialisation. Then, we combine these improved technologies to develop an efficient jailbreak method, dubbed $\mathcal{I}$-GCG. In our experiments, we evaluate on a series of benchmarks (such as NeurIPS 2023 Red Teaming Track). The results demonstrate that our improved techniques can help GCG outperform state-of-the-art jailbreaking attacks and achieve nearly 100% attack success rate. The code is released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/I-GCG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Federated Learning, it is crucial to handle low-quality, corrupted, or malicious data. However, traditional data valuation methods are not suitable due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called "lazy influence" to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their own data to estimate the influence of another participant's batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the central coordinator. Our method has been shown to successfully filter out biased and corrupted data in various simulated and real-world settings, achieving a recall rate of over $&gt;90\%$ (sometimes up to $100\%$) while maintaining strong differential privacy guarantees with $\varepsilon \leq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years discussions centered around digital inheritance have increased among social media users and across blockchain ecosystems. As a result digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading to the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon the testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for digital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a use case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed within this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the findings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors and developers. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential impacts and risks of other technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing this study provides a primer for users to begin planning a digital inheritance strategy and for developers to develop a more intuitive solution.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Multi-private Key Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of privacy leaks in federated learning, secure aggregation protocols that mainly adopt either homomorphic encryption or threshold secret sharing have been widely developed for federated learning to protect the privacy of the local training data of each client. However, these existing protocols suffer from many shortcomings, such as the dependence on a trusted third party, the vulnerability to clients being corrupted, low efficiency, the trade-off between security and fault tolerance, etc. To solve these disadvantages, we propose an efficient and multi-private key secure aggregation scheme for federated learning. Specifically, we skillfully modify the variant ElGamal encryption technique to achieve homomorphic addition operation, which has two important advantages: 1) The server and each client can freely select public and private keys without introducing a trust third party and 2) Compared to the variant ElGamal encryption, the plaintext space is relatively large, which is more suitable for the deep model. Besides, for the high dimensional deep model parameter, we introduce a super-increasing sequence to compress multi-dimensional data into 1-D, which can greatly reduce encryption and decryption times as well as communication for ciphertext transmission. Detailed security analyses show that our proposed scheme achieves the semantic security of both individual local gradients and the aggregated result while achieving optimal robustness in tolerating both client collusion and dropped clients. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of our scheme is almost the same as the non-private approach, while the efficiency of our scheme is much better than the state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption-based secure aggregation schemes. More importantly, the efficiency advantages of our scheme will become increasingly prominent as the number of model parameters increases.</description>

      <title>The Road to Trust: Building Enclaves within Confidential VMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrity is critical for maintaining system security, as it ensures that only genuine software is loaded onto a machine. Although confidential virtual machines (CVMs) function within isolated environments separate from the host, it is important to recognize that users still encounter challenges in maintaining control over the integrity of the code running within the trusted execution environments (TEEs). The presence of a sophisticated operating system (OS) raises the possibility of dynamically creating and executing any code, making user applications within TEEs vulnerable to interference or tampering if the guest OS is compromised. To address this issue, this paper introduces NestedSGX, a framework which leverages virtual machine privilege level (VMPL), a recent hardware feature available on AMD SEV-SNP to enable the creation of hardware enclaves within the guest VM. Similar to Intel SGX, NestedSGX considers the guest OS untrusted for loading potentially malicious code. It ensures that only trusted and measured code executed within the enclave can be remotely attested. To seamlessly protect existing applications, NestedSGX aims for compatibility with Intel SGX by simulating SGX leaf functions. We have also ported the SGX SDK and the Occlum library OS to NestedSGX, enabling the use of existing SGX toolchains and applications in the system. Performance evaluations show that context switches in NestedSGX take about 32,000 -- 34,000 cycles, approximately $1.33\times$ -- $1.54\times$ higher than that of Intel SGX. NestedSGX incurs minimal overhead in most real-world applications, with an average overhead below 2% for computation and memory intensive workloads and below 15.68% for I/O intensive workloads.</description>

Abstract: Credential theft and remote attacks are the most serious threats to user authentication mechanisms. The crux of these problems is that we cannot control such behaviors. However, if a password does not contain user secrets, stealing it is useless. If unauthorized inputs are invalidated, remote attacks can be disabled. Thus, credential secrets and account input fields can be controlled. Rather than encrypting passwords, we design a dual-password login-authentication mechanism, where a user-selected secret-free login password is converted into an untypable authentication password. Subsequently, the authenticatable functionality of the login password and the typable functionality of the authentication password can be disabled or invalidated to prevent credential theft and remote attacks. Thus, the usability-security tradeoff and password reuse issues are resolved; local authentication password storage is no longer necessary. More importantly, the password converter acts as an open hashing algorithm, meaning that its intermediate elements can be used to define a truly unique identity for the login process to implement a novel dual-identity authentication scheme. In particular, the system-managed elements are concealed, inaccessible, and independent of any personal information and therefore can be used to define a perfect unforgeable process identifier to identify unauthorized inputs.</description>

      <title>Fuzzychain: An Equitable Consensus Mechanism for Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has become a trusted method for establishing secure and transparent transactions through a distributed, encrypted network. The operation of blockchain is governed by consensus algorithms, among which Proof of Stake (PoS) is popular yet has its drawbacks, notably the potential for centralising power in nodes with larger stakes or higher rewards. Fuzzychain, our proposed solution, introduces the use of fuzzy sets to define stake semantics, promoting decentralised and distributed processing control. This system selects validators based on their degree of membership to the stake fuzzy sets rather than just the size of their stakes. As a pioneer proposal in applying fuzzy sets to blockchain, Fuzzychain aims to rectify PoS's limitations. Our results indicate that Fuzzychain not only matches PoS in functionality but also ensures a fairer distribution of stakes among validators, leading to more inclusive validator selection and a better-distributed network.</description>

      <title>TrojanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Can Be Backdoor Driver in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about potential security threats despite performing significantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at all stages, but the cost and robustness have been criticized. Attacking LLMs is inherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides, the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In this paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attack scenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts and trigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimized by contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to a parameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAG for the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structured data to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalize the backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoors from both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether the context is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models. Extensive experimental results on truthfulness, language understanding, and harmfulness show that TrojanRAG exhibits versatility threats while maintaining retrieval capabilities on normal queries.</description>

      <title>Robustifying Safety-Aligned Large Language Models through Clean Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable when trained on datasets containing harmful content, which leads to potential jailbreaking attacks in two scenarios: the integration of harmful texts within crowdsourced data used for pre-training and direct tampering with LLMs through fine-tuning. In both scenarios, adversaries can compromise the safety alignment of LLMs, exacerbating malfunctions. Motivated by the need to mitigate these adversarial influences, our research aims to enhance safety alignment by either neutralizing the impact of malicious texts in pre-training datasets or increasing the difficulty of jailbreaking during downstream fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a data curation framework designed to counter adversarial impacts in both scenarios. Our method operates under the assumption that we have no prior knowledge of attack details, focusing solely on curating clean texts. We introduce an iterative process aimed at revising texts to reduce their perplexity as perceived by LLMs, while simultaneously preserving their text quality. By pre-training or fine-tuning LLMs with curated clean texts, we observe a notable improvement in LLM robustness regarding safety alignment against harmful queries. For instance, when pre-training LLMs using a crowdsourced dataset containing 5\% harmful instances, adding an equivalent amount of curated texts significantly mitigates the likelihood of providing harmful responses in LLMs and reduces the attack success rate by 71\%. Our study represents a significant step towards mitigating the risks associated with training-based jailbreaking and fortifying the secure utilization of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Data Generation with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite several works that succeed in generating synthetic data with differential privacy (DP) guarantees, they are inadequate for generating high-quality synthetic data when the input data has missing values. In this work, we formalize the problems of DP synthetic data with missing values and propose three effective adaptive strategies that significantly improve the utility of the synthetic data on four real-world datasets with different types and levels of missing data and privacy requirements. We also identify the relationship between privacy impact for the complete ground truth data and incomplete data for these DP synthetic data generation algorithms. We model the missing mechanisms as a sampling process to obtain tighter upper bounds for the privacy guarantees to the ground truth data. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for using private synthetic data generation algorithms in the presence of missing data.</description>

      <title>The Earth is Flat because...: Investigating LLMs' Belief towards Misinformation via Persuasive Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09085v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies.</description>

      <title>Resampling methods for Private Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of constructing confidence intervals with differential privacy. We propose two private variants of the non-parametric bootstrap, which privately compute the median of the results of multiple "little" bootstraps run on partitions of the data and give asymptotic bounds on the coverage error of the resulting confidence intervals. For a fixed differential privacy parameter $\epsilon$, our methods enjoy the same error rates as that of the non-private bootstrap to within logarithmic factors in the sample size $n$. We empirically validate the performance of our methods for mean estimation, median estimation, and logistic regression with both real and synthetic data. Our methods achieve similar coverage accuracy to existing methods (and non-private baselines) while providing notably shorter ($\gtrsim 10$ times) confidence intervals than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalization or Memorization: Data Contamination and Trustworthy Evaluation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks. Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, it could explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being more susceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of training data, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetic training data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands for Contamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates only the sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakedness of LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination in evaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via output Distribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. To facilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DetCon and ComiEval, for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relative improvements of 21.8\%-30.2\% over other contamination detection approaches in terms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detect implicit contamination. TED substantially mitigates performance improvements up to 66.9\% attributed to data contamination across various contamination setups. In real-world applications, we reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high potential to suffer from data contamination on HumanEval benchmark.</description>
