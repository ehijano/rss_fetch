      <title>Control of Power Grids With Switching Equilibria: $\Omega$-Limit Sets and Input-to-State Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a power transmission system with both conventional generators (CGs) and distributed energy assets (DEAs) providing frequency control. We consider an operating condition with demand aggregating two dynamic components: one that switches between different values on a finite set, and one that varies smoothly over time. Such dynamic operating conditions may result from protection scheme activations, external cyber-attacks, or due to the integration of dynamic loads, such as data centers. Mathematically, the dynamics of the resulting system are captured by a system that switches between a finite number of vector fields -- or modes--, with each mode having a distinct equilibrium point induced by the demand aggregation. To analyze the stability properties of the resulting switching system, we leverage tools from hybrid dynamic inclusions and the concept of $\Omega$-limit sets from sets. Specifically, we characterize a compact set that is semi-globally practically asymptotically stable under the assumption that the switching frequency and load variation rate are sufficiently slow. For arbitrarily fast variations of the load, we use a level-set argument with multiple Lyapunov functions to establish input-to-state stability of a larger set and with respect to the rate of change of the loads. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations on the IEEE 39-bus test system.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for extremals in sub-Lorentzian and Finsler problems on 2- and 3-dimensional Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of finding geodesics in a series of left-invariant problems endowed with sub-Lorentzian and Finsler structures. Explicit formulas for extremals are obtained in terms of convex trigonometric functions. In the sub-Lorentzian setting, the new trigonometric functions $\cosh_\Omega$ and $\sinh_\Omega$, developed here, prove especially useful; they generalize the classical $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ to the case of an unbounded convex set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Affine-Invariant Global Non-Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of BFGS under Self-Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish global non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the BFGS quasi-Newton method without requiring strong convexity or the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient or Hessian. Instead, we consider the setting where the objective function is strictly convex and strongly self-concordant. For an arbitrary initial point and any arbitrary positive-definite initial Hessian approximation, we prove global linear and superlinear convergence guarantees for BFGS when the step size is determined using a line search scheme satisfying the weak Wolfe conditions. Moreover, all our global guarantees are affine-invariant, with the convergence rates depending solely on the initial error and the strongly self-concordant constant. Our results extend the global non-asymptotic convergence theory of BFGS beyond traditional assumptions and, for the first time, establish affine-invariant convergence guarantees aligning with the inherent affine invariance of the BFGS method.</description>

      <title>Convex Submodular Minimization with Indicator Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of convex submodular optimization problems with indicator variables. Many applications such as the problem of inferring Markov random fields (MRFs) with a sparsity or robustness prior can be naturally modeled in this form. We show that these problems can be reduced to binary submodular minimization problems, possibly after a suitable reformulation, and thus are strongly polynomially solvable. %We also discuss the implication of our results in the case of quadratic objectives. Furthermore, we develop a parametric approach for computing the associated extreme bases under certain smoothness conditions. This leads to a fast solution method, whose efficiency is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Graphon Games with Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of targeted intervention problems in dynamic network and graphon games. First, we study a general dynamic network game in which players interact over a graph and maximize their heterogeneous, concave goal functionals, which depend on both their own actions and their interactions with their neighbors. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in both the finite-player network game and the corresponding infinite-player graphon game. We also prove the convergence of the Nash equilibrium in the network game to the one in the graphon game, providing explicit bounds on the convergence rate. Using this framework, we introduce a central planner who implements a dynamic targeted intervention. Given a fixed budget, the planner maximizes the average welfare at equilibrium by perturbing the players' heterogeneous objectives, thereby influencing the resulting Nash equilibrium. Using a novel fixed-point argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal intervention in the graphon setting, and show that it achieves near-optimal performance in large finite networks, again with explicit bounds on the convergence rate. As an application, we study the special case of linear-quadratic objectives and exploit the spectral decomposition of the graphon operator to derive semi-explicit solutions for the optimal intervention. This spectral approach provides key insights into the design of optimal interventions in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rates of moment-SOS hierarchies approximation of truncated moment sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moment-SOS hierarchy is a widely applicable framework to address polynomial optimization problems over basic semi-algebraic sets based on positivity certificates of polynomial. Recent works show that the convergence rate of this hierarchy over certain simple sets, namely, the unit ball, hypercube, and standard simplex, is of the order $O(1/r^2)$, where r denotes the level of the moment-SOS hierarchy. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the convergence rate of the moment-SOS hierarchy by estimating the Hausdorff distance between the set of truncated pseudo-moment sequences and the set of truncated moment sequences specified by Tchakaloff's theorem. Our results provide a connection between the convergence rate of the moment-SOS hierarchy and the Lojasiewicz exponent L of the domain under the compactness assumption, where we establish the convergence rate of $O(1/r^L)$. Consequently, we obtain the convergence rate of $O(1/r)$ for polytopes and sets satisfying the constraint qualification condition, $O(1/\sqrt{r})$ for domains that either satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition or are defined by locally strongly convex polynomials. We also obtain the convergence rate of $O(1/r^2)$ for general polynomials over a sphere.</description>

      <title>General Perturbation Resilient Dynamic String-Averaging for Inconsistent Problems with Superiorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a General Dynamic String-Averaging (GDSA) iterative scheme and investigate its convergence properties in the inconsistent case, that is, when the input operators don't have a common fixed point. The Dynamic String-Averaging Projection (DSAP) algorithm itself was introduced in an 2013 paper, where its strong convergence and bounded perturbation resilience were studied in the consistent case (that is, when the sets under consideration had a nonempty intersection). Results involving combination of the DSAP method with superiorization, were presented in 2015. The proof of the weak convergence of our GDSA method is based on the notion of "strong coherence" of sequences of operators that was introduced in 2019. This is an improvement of the property of "coherence" of sequences of operators introduced in 2001 by Bauschke and Combettes. Strong coherence provides a more convenient sufficient convergence condition for methods that employ infinite sequences of operators and it turns out to be a useful general tool when applied to proving the convergence of many iterative methods. In this paper we combine the ideas of both dynamic string-averaging and strong coherence, in order to analyze our GDSA method for a general class of operators and its bounded perturbation resilience in the inconsistent case with weak and strong convergence. We then discuss an application of the GDSA method to the Superiorization Methodology, developing results on the behavior of its superiorized version.</description>

      <title>Ranking Quantilized Mean-Field Games with an Application to Early-Stage Venture Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantilized mean-field game models involve quantiles of the population's distribution. We study a class of such games with a capacity for ranking games, where the performance of each agent is evaluated based on its terminal state relative to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This evaluation criterion is designed to select the top $(1-\alpha)\%$ performing agents. We provide two formulations for this competition: a target-based formulation and a threshold-based formulation. In the former and latter formulations, to satisfy the selection condition, each agent aims for its terminal state to be \textit{exactly} equal and \textit{at least} equal to the population's $\alpha$-quantile value, respectively.
  For the target-based formulation, we obtain an analytic solution and demonstrate the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the asymptotic best-response strategies in the $N$-player game. Specifically, the quantilized mean-field consistency condition is expressed as a set of forward-backward ordinary differential equations, characterizing the $\alpha$-quantile value at equilibrium. For the threshold-based formulation, we obtain a semi-explicit solution and numerically solve the resulting quantilized mean-field consistency condition.
  Subsequently, we propose a new application in the context of early-stage venture investments, where a venture capital firm financially supports a group of start-up companies engaged in a competition over a finite time horizon, with the goal of selecting a percentage of top-ranking ones to receive the next round of funding at the end of the time horizon. We present the results and interpretations of numerical experiments for both formulations discussed in this context and show that the target-based formulation provides a very good approximation for the threshold-based formulation.</description>

      <title>REAP-T: A MATLAB Toolbox for Implementing Robust-to-Early Termination Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a MATLAB toolbox for implementing robust-to-early termination model predictive control, abbreviated as REAP, which is designed to ensure a sub-optimal yet feasible solution when MPC computations are prematurely terminated due to limited computational resources. Named REAP-T, this toolbox is a comprehensive, user-friendly, and modular platform that enables users to explore, analyze, and customize various components of REAP for their specific applications. Notable attributes of REAP-T are: (i) utilization of built-in MATLAB functions for defining the MPC problem; (ii) an interactive and intuitive graphical user interface for parameter tuning and visualization; (iii) real-time simulation capabilities, allowing users to observe and understand the real-time behavior of their systems; and (iv) inclusion of real-world examples designed to guide users through its effective use.</description>

      <title>Swarm-based optimization with jumps: a kinetic BGK framework and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are powerful tools for global optimization, particularly for non-convex and non-differentiable problems where exact methods are often impractical. Particle-based optimization methods, inspired by swarm intelligence principles, have shown effectiveness due to their ability to balance exploration and exploitation within the search space. In this work, we introduce a novel particle-based optimization algorithm where velocities are updated via random jumps, a strategy commonly used to enhance stochastic exploration. We formalize this approach by describing the dynamics through a kinetic modelling of BGK type, offering a unified framework that accommodates general noise distributions, including heavy-tailed ones like Cauchy. Under suitable parameter scaling, the model reduces to the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) dynamics. For non-degenerate Gaussian noise in bounded domains, we prove propagation of chaos and convergence towards minimizers. Numerical results on benchmark problems validate the approach and highlight its connection to CBO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence rate of the monotone accelerated proximal gradient method, which can be used to solve structured convex composite optimization problems. A linear convergence rate is established when the smooth part of the objective function is strongly convex, without knowledge of the strong convexity parameter. This is the fastest convergence rate known for this algorithm.</description>

      <title>A unified framework on the universal approximation of transformer-type architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.</description>

      <title>Dissociation limits in Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the {\it Density Functional Theory} (DFT) framework, where a functional of the form $$F_\eps(\rho)=\eps T(\rho)+bC(\rho)-U(\rho)$$ has to be minimized in the class of non-negative measures $\rho$ which have a prescribed total mass $m$ (the total electronic charge). The parameter $\eps$ is small and the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ respectively represent the kinetic energy, the electronic repulsive correlation, the potential interaction term between electrons and nuclei. Several expressions for the above terms have been considered in the literature and our framework is general enough to include most of them.
  It is known that in general, when the positive charge of the nuclei is small, the so-called {\it ionization phenomenon} may occur, consisting in the fact that the minimizers of $F_\eps$ can have a total mass lower than $m$; this physically means that some of the electrons may escape to infinity when the attraction of the nuclei is not strong enough.
  Our main goal, continuing the research we started in \cite{bbcd18}, is to study the asymptotic behavior of the minimizers of $F_\eps$ as $\eps\to0$. We show that the $\Gamma$-limit functional is defined on sums of Dirac masses and has an explicit expression that depends on the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ that the model takes into account.
  Some explicit examples illustrate how the electrons are distributed around the nuclei according to the model used.</description>

      <title>What Makes Local Updates Effective: The Role of Data Heterogeneity and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Learning for routing: A guided review of recent developments and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML) tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models, there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inverse-free dynamical system is proposed to solve the generalized absolute value equation (GAVE) within a fixed time, where the time of convergence is finite and is uniformly bounded for all initial points. Moreover, an iterative method obtained by using the forward-Euler discretization of the proposed dynamic model are developed and sufficient conditions which guarantee that the discrete iteration globally converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the unique solution of GAVE within a finite number of iterative steps are given.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MPGP-type Methods Through Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the acceleration of MPGP-type algorithms using preconditioning for the solution of quadratic programming problems. The preconditioning needs to be done only on the free set so as not to change the constraints. A variant of preconditioning restricted to the free set is the preconditioning in face. The inner preconditioner in preconditioning in face needs to be recomputed or updated every time the free set changes. Here, we investigate an approximate variant of preconditioning in face that computes the inner preconditioner only once. We analyze the error of the approximate variant and provide numerical experiments demonstrating that very large speedups can be achieved by the approximate variant.</description>

      <title>A convex lifting approach for the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Calder\'on problem consists in recovering an unknown coefficient of a partial differential equation from boundary measurements of its solution. These measurements give rise to a highly nonlinear forward operator. As a consequence, the development of reconstruction methods for this inverse problem is challenging, as they usually suffer from the problem of local convergence. To circumvent this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on lifting and convex relaxation techniques, that have been successfully developed for solving finite-dimensional quadratic inverse problems. This leads to a convex optimization problem whose solution coincides with the sought-after coefficient, provided that a non-degenerate source condition holds. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on a toy model where the solution of the partial differential equation is known everywhere in the domain. In this simplified setting, we verify that the non-degenerate source condition holds under certain assumptions on the unknown coefficient. We leave the investigation of its validity in the Calder\'on setting for future works.</description>

      <title>Geometrization of Higher-Order Linear Control Laws for Attitude Control on $\mathsf{SO(3)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the stability of higher-order geometric nonlinear control laws for attitude control on the Special Orthogonal Group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. In particular, the paper extends existing results on the analysis of PID-type geometric nonlinear control laws to more general higher-order dynamic state-feedback compensators on $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. The candidate Lyapunov function is motivated by quadratic Lyapunov functions of the form $V(x)=x^{\top}Px$ typically considered in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The stability analysis is carried out in two steps. In the first step, a sufficient condition is obtained for the positive definiteness of the candidate Lyapunov function, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the negative definiteness of the corresponding Lyapunov rate. These conditions ensure that the desired equilibrium is almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS). In the second step, a convex relaxation of the proposed conditions is used to obtain sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Overall, the approach is motivated by the widespread use of LMI-based analysis and design tools for LTI systems. To reduce conservatism, matrix gains are considered for the controller gains as well as the Lyapunov function coefficients. The applicability of the approach to practical problems is illustrated by designing and analyzing a 21-state geometric nonlinear attitude control law for a multicopter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-negative elements in group algebras play a crucial role in the study of functions, measures and operators. This paper focuses on the sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS) of non-negative elements in group algebras of finite groups. We first prove that for a given non-negative element, the optimal solution of the convex relaxation of the sparse SOHS problem is precisely its square root. Then we propose a hierarchy for the sparse SOHS problem, and we analyze the error of the hierarchy with respect to two types of residuals. Notably, we prove that both errors decay exponentially. Moreover, we show that for one type of error, the decay rate is independent of the order of the group. For the other type, we demonstrate that the rate is also independent of the group order, provided that the group is cyclic or dihedral.</description>

      <title>A constraint-based approach to function interpolation, with application to performance estimation for weakly convex optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining interpolation constraints for function classes, i.e., necessary and sufficient constraints that a set of points, function values and (sub)gradients must satisfy to ensure the existence of a global function of the class considered, consistent with this set. The derivation of such constraints is crucial, e.g., in the performance analysis of optimization methods, since obtaining a priori tight performance guarantees requires using a tight description of function classes of interest. We propose an approach that allows setting aside all analytic properties of the function class to work only at an algebraic level, and to obtain counterexamples when a condition characterizing a function class cannot serve as an interpolation constraint. As an illustration, we provide interpolation constraints for the class of weakly convex functions with bounded subgradients, and rely on these constraints to outperform state-of-the-art bounds on the performance of the subgradient method on this class.</description>

      <title>BattOpt: Optimal Facility Planning for Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain will face challenges in sourcing scarce and expensive minerals required for manufacturing and in disposing of hazardous retired batteries. Integrating recycling technology into the supply chain has the potential to alleviate these issues; however, players in the battery market must design investment plans for recycling facilities. In this paper, we propose a multistage stochastic optimization model for computing minimum cost recycling capacity decisions, in which retired batteries are recycled and recovered materials are used to manufacture new batteries. We transform EverBatt, a leading evaluation framework for battery recycling cost and environmental impact, into a prescriptive decision-making tool for determining optimal investment strategies. Our model is a separable concave minimization subject to linear constraints, a class for which we design a new finitely convergent global optimization algorithm that solves up to 14x faster than comparable algorithms. We propose an equivalent reformulation of the model that reduces the total number of variables by introducing integrality constraints, drastically reducing solve times. We detail a cut grouping strategy for a Benders' decomposition which improves convergence relative to single-cut and multi-cut implementations. To produce a set of operational scenarios, we design an approach for generating time-series projections for new battery demand, retired battery supply, and material costs, leveraging state-of-the-art econometric models. We apply our model to compute optimal investment plans and quantify the impact of optimal decision-making: effective investment in recycling can reduce battery manufacturing costs by 22% and environmental impacts by up to 7%. Finally, we analyze the impact of policy instruments to reveal key insights on the efficacy of capacity grants and production credits.</description>

      <title>Projection onto hyperbolicity cones and beyond: a dual Frank-Wolfe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of projecting a point onto an arbitrary hyperbolicity cone from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. While hyperbolicity cones are furnished with a generalization of the notion of eigenvalues, obtaining closed form expressions for the projection operator as in the case of semidefinite matrices is an elusive endeavour. To address that we propose a Frank-Wolfe method to handle this task and, more generally, strongly convex optimization over closed convex cones. One of our innovations is that the Frank-Wolfe method is actually applied to the dual problem and, by doing so, subproblems can be solved in closed-form using minimum eigenvalue functions and conjugate vectors. To test the validity of our proposed approach, we present numerical experiments where we check the performance of alternative approaches including interior point methods and an earlier accelerated gradient method proposed by Renegar. We also show numerical examples where the hyperbolic polynomial has millions of monomials. Finally, we also discuss the problem of projecting onto p-cones which, although not hyperbolicity cones in general, are still amenable to our techniques.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Proximal ADMM for Nonconvex Linearly Constrained Composite Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an adaptive proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving linearly constrained, composite optimization problems under the assumption that the smooth component of the objective is weakly convex, while the non-smooth component is convex and block-separable. The proposed method is adaptive to all problem parameters, including smoothness and weak convexity constants, and allows each of its block proximal subproblems to be inexactly solved. Each iteration of our adaptive proximal ADMM consists of two steps: the sequential solution of each block proximal subproblem; and adaptive tests to decide whether to perform a full Lagrange multiplier and/or penalty parameter update(s). Without any rank assumptions on the constraint matrices, it is shown that the adaptive proximal ADMM obtains an approximate first-order stationary point of the constrained problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM's. The three proof-of-concept numerical experiments that conclude the paper suggest our adaptive proximal ADMM enjoys significant computational benefits.</description>

      <title>The Competive Spectral Radius of Families of Nonexpansive Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new class of repeated zero-sum games in which the payoff is the escape rate of a switched dynamical system, where at every stage, the transition is given by a nonexpansive operator depending on the actions of both players. This generalizes to the two-player (and non-linear) case the notion of joint spectral radius of a family of matrices. We show that the value of this game does exist, and we characterize it in terms of an infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem. This provides a two-player analogue of Ma\~ne's lemma from ergodic control. This also extends to the two-player case results of Kohlberg and Neyman (1981), Karlsson (2001), and Vigeral and the second author (2012), concerning the asymptotic behavior of nonexpansive mappings. We discuss two special cases of this game: order preserving and positively homogeneous self-maps of a cone equipped with Funk's and Thompson's metrics, and groups of translations.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Varying Parameters in Dynamical Systems: A Modular Framework Using Switch Detection, Optimization, and Sparse Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of static parameters in dynamical systems and control theory has been extensively studied, with significant progress made in estimating varying parameters in specific system types. Suppose, in the general case, we have data from a system with parameters that depend on an independent variable such as time or space. Further, suppose the system's model structure is known, but our aim is to identify functions describing parameter-varying elements as they change with respect to time or another variable. Focusing initially on the subclass of problems where parameters are discretely switching piecewise constant functions, we develop an algorithmic framework for detecting discrete parameter switches and fitting a piecewise constant model to data using optimization-based parameter estimation. Our modular framework allows for customization of switch detection, numerical integration, and optimization sub-steps to suit user requirements. Binary segmentation is used for switch detection, with Nelder-Mead and Powell methods employed for optimization. To address broader problems, we extend our framework using dictionary-based sparse regression with trigonometric and polynomial functions to obtain continuously varying parameter functions. Finally, we assess the framework's robustness to measurement noise. We demonstrate its capabilities across several examples, including time-varying promoter-gene expression, a genetic toggle switch, a parameter-switching manifold, the heat equation with a time-varying diffusion coefficient, and the advection-diffusion equation with a continuously varying parameter.</description>

      <title>Level-set topology optimisation with unfitted finite elements and automatic shape differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop automatic shape differentiation techniques for unfitted discretisations and link these to recent advances in shape calculus for unfitted methods. We extend existing analytic shape calculus results to the case where the domain boundary intersects with the boundary of the background domain. We further show that we can recover these analytic derivatives to machine precision regardless of the mesh size using the developed automatic shape differentiation techniques, drastically reducing the burden associated with the analytic derivation of these quantities. In addition, we show that we can also recover the symmetric shape Hessian. We implement these techniques for both serial and distributed computing frameworks in the Julia package GridapTopOpt and the wider Gridap ecosystem. As part of this implementation we propose a novel graph-based approach for isolated volume detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the unfitted automatic shape differentiation framework and our implementation by considering the three-dimensional minimum compliance topology optimisation of a linear elastic wheel and of a linear elastic structure in a fluid-structure interaction problem with Stokes flow. The implementation is general and allows GridapTopOpt to solve a wider range of problems on unstructured meshes without analytic calculation of shape derivatives and avoiding issues that arise when material properties are smoothed at the domain boundary. The software is open source and available at https://github.com/zjwegert/GridapTopOpt.jl.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for polynomial optimization on set products</title>

Abstract: We consider polynomial optimization problems on Cartesian products of basic compact semialgebraic sets. The solution of such problems can be approximated as closely as desired by hierarchies of semidefinite programming relaxations, based on classical sums of squares certificates due to Putinar and Schm\"udgen. When the feasible set is the bi-sphere, i.e., the Cartesian product of two unit spheres, we show that the hierarchies based on the Schm\"udgen-type certificates converge to the global minimum of the objective polynomial at a rate in $O(1/t^2)$, where $t$ is the relaxation order. Our proof is based on the polynomial kernel method. We extend this result to arbitrary sphere products and give a general recipe to obtain convergence rates for polynomial optimization over products of distinct sets. Eventually, we rely on our results for the bi-sphere to analyze the speed of convergence of a semidefinite programming hierarchy approximating the order $2$ quantum Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean dual gradient ascent for entropically regularized linear and semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimization framework that exhibits dimension-independent convergence on a broad class of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</description>

      <title>Empirical and computer-aided robustness analysis of long-step and accelerated methods in smooth convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations. Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Charging Scheduling via Balanced Bounding Box Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric mobility faces several challenges, most notably the high cost of infrastructure development and the underutilization of charging stations. The concept of shared charging offers a promising solution. The paper explores sustainable urban logistics through horizontal collaboration between two fleet operators and addresses a scheduling problem for the shared use of charging stations. To tackle this, the study formulates a collaborative scheduling problem as a bi-objective nonlinear integer programming model, in which each company aims to minimize its own costs, creating inherent conflicts that require trade-offs. The Balanced Bounding Box Methods (B3Ms) are introduced in order to efficiently derive the efficient frontier, identifying a reduced set of representative solutions. These methods enhance computational efficiency by selectively disregarding closely positioned and competing solutions, preserving the diversity and representativeness of the solutions over the efficient frontier. To determine the final solution and ensure balanced collaboration, cooperative bargaining methods are applied. Numerical case studies demonstrate the viability and scalability of the developed methods, showing that the B3Ms can significantly reduce computational time while maintaining the integrity of the frontier. These methods, along with cooperative bargaining, provide an effective framework for solving various bi-objective optimization problems, extending beyond the collaborative scheduling problem presented here.</description>

      <title>PSD and SOS Biquadratic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert proved in 1888 that a positive semi-definite (psd) homogeneous quartic polynomial of three variables always can be expressed as the sum of squares (sos) of three quadratic polynomials, and a psd homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables may not be sos. Only after 89 years, in 1977, Choi and Lam gave the explicit expression of such a psd-not-sos (pns) homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables. An $m \times n$ biquadratic polynomial is a homogeneous quartic polynomial of $m+n$ variables. In this note, we show that an $m \times n$ biquadratic polynomial can be expressed as a tripartite homogeneous quartic polynomial of $m+n-1$ variables. Therefore, a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial is always sos. On the other hand, the Choi-Lam polynomial is not a tripartite homogeneous quartic polynomial. Thus, it is still an open question whether there exists a $3 \times 2$ pns biquadratic polynomial. Furthermore, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic polynomial to be sos, and show that if such a polynomial is sos, then its sos rank is at most $mn$.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>Maximum Dispersion, Maximum Concentration: Enhancing the Quality of MOP Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision space.</description>

      <title>Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Global bundle adjustment is made easy by depth prediction and convex optimization. We (i) propose a scaled bundle adjustment (SBA) formulation that lifts 2D keypoint measurements to 3D with learned depth, (ii) design an empirically tight convex semidfinite program (SDP) relaxation that solves SBA to certfiable global optimality, (iii) solve the SDP relaxations at extreme scale with Burer-Monteiro factorization and a CUDA-based trust-region Riemannian optimizer (dubbed XM), (iv) build a structure from motion (SfM) pipeline with XM as the optimization engine and show that XM-SfM compares favorably with existing pipelines in terms of reconstruction quality while being significantly faster, more scalable, and initialization-free.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.</description>

      <title>Both Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence of Quasi-Hyperbolic Momentum using Increasing Batch Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization -- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for training neural networks.</description>
