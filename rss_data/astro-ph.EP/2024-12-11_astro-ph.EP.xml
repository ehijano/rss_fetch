      <title>Io's SO2 and NaCl Wind Fields From ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved measurements of SO$_2$ and NaCl winds on Io at several unique points in its orbit: before and after eclipse, and at maximum eastern and western elongation. The derived wind fields represent a unique case of meteorology in a rarified, volcanic atmosphere. Through the use of Doppler shift measurements in emission spectra obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between $\sim346$-430GHz ($\sim0.70$-0.87 mm), line-of-sight winds up to $\sim-100$ m s$^{-1}$ in the approaching direction and &gt;250 m s$^{-1}$ in the receding direction were derived for SO$_2$ at altitudes of $\sim10$-50 km, while NaCl winds consistently reached $\sim$|150-200| m s$^{-1}$ in localized regions up to $\sim30$ km above the surface. The wind distributions measured at maximum east and west Jovian elongations, and on the subJovian hemisphere pre- and post-eclipse, were found to be significantly different and complex, corroborating the results of simulations that include surface temperature and frost distribution, volcanic activity, and interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. Further, the wind speeds of SO$_2$ and NaCl are often inconsistent in direction and magnitude, indicating that the processes that drive the winds for the two molecular species are different and potentially uncoupled; while the SO$_2$ wind field can be explained through a combination of sublimation-driven winds, plasma torus interactions, and plume activity, the NaCl winds appear to be primarily driven by the plasma torus.</description>

      <title>Early Solar System Turbulence Constrained by High Oxidation States of the Oldest Non-Carbonaceous Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early Solar System (SS) planetesimals constitute the parent bodies of most meteorites investigated today. Nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of bulk meteorites have revealed a dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) groups. Planetesimals sampling NC and CC isotopic signatures are conventionally thought to originate from the "dry" inner disk, and volatile-rich outer disk, respectively, with their segregation enforced by a pressure bump close to the water-ice sublimation line, possibly tied to Jupiter's formation. This framework is challenged by emerging evidence that the oldest NC planetesimals (i.e., the iron meteorites parent bodies; IMPBs) were characterized by far higher oxidation states than previously imagined, suggesting abundant ($\gtrsim$ few wt.%) liquid water in their interiors prior to core differentiation. In this paper, we employ a model for a degassing icy planetesimal (heated by $^{26}$Al decay) to map the conditions for liquid water production therein. Our work culminates in threshold characteristic sizes for pebbles composing the said planetesimal, under which water-ice melting occurs. Adopting a model for a disk evolving under both turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic disk winds, and assuming pebble growth is fragmentation-limited, we self-consistently translate the threshold pebble size to lower limits on early SS turbulence. We find that if NC IMPBs were "wet," their constituent pebbles must have been smaller than a few centimeters, corresponding to typical values of the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha_{\nu}$ turbulence parameter in excess of $10^{-3}$. These findings argue against a quiescent SS disk (for &lt;10 AU), are concordant with astronomical constraints on protoplanetary disk turbulence, and suggest pebble accretion played a secondary role in building our rocky planets.</description>

      <title>Tides on Lava Worlds: Application to Close-in Exoplanets and the Early Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of Solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: The tidal history of the early Earth-Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact; and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early Lunar recession to ${\sim} 25$ Earth radii within $10^4{-} 10^5$ years, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin-orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin-orbit resonances and accelerating their track towards tidal synchronization from a Gyr to Myr timescale. Moreover, we re-evaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.</description>

      <title>Planetary Dynamos in Evolving Cold Gas Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields remain one of the least understood aspects of exoplanetary systems. A deeper understanding of planetary dynamos and the evolution of surface magnetic properties throughout a planet's lifetime is a key scientific purpose, with implications for planetary evolution, habitability, and atmospheric dynamics. This study models the evolution of magnetic fields generated by dynamo action in cold giant gaseous planets. We solve the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations under anelastic approximation with a 3D pseudo-spectral spherical shell MHD code. We employ 1D thermodynamical hydrostatic profiles taken from gas giant evolutionary models as the background states of our MHD models. Numerical integration leads to saturated dynamo solutions. Such calculations are performed with radial profiles corresponding to different planetary ages so that we can interpret them as different snapshots of the magnetoconvection evolution during the long-term planetary evolution. We characterize magnetic fields across different evolutionary stages of a cold gaseous planet in terms of topology and strength. We find the occurrence of a transition from multipolar to dipolar-dominated dynamo regime throughout the life of a Jovian planet. During the planetary evolution and the cooling down phase, we observe a decrease in the average magnetic field strength near the dynamo surface as $\sim t^{-0.2}-t^{-0.3}$, a trend compatible with previously proposed scaling laws. We also find that some dimensionless parameters evolve differently for the multipolar to dipolar branch, possibly reflecting a force balance change. This approach can be extended to study hot gaseous planets, offering a versatile tool for interpreting the magnetic properties of giant planets.</description>

      <title>Two Distinct Populations of Dark Comets Delineated by Orbits and Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bodies are capable of delivering essential prerequisites for the development of life, such as volatiles and organics, to the terrestrial planets. For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to the Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System. Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects (NEOs) were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these "dark comets" display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here we report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects previously classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of $\sim10$, $0.1$, and $0.1$ kg s$^{-1}$ for 1998 FR$_{11}$, 2001 ME$_{1}$, and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, "outer" dark comets on eccentric orbits that are end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, "inner" dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a new population. These objects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided essential material to the Earth.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous emission from dust and gas in the planetary debris orbiting a white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence for the presence and variability of circumstellar dust and gas around white dwarfs that are polluted with exoplanetary material, although the origin of this dust and gas remains debated. This paper presents the first near-simultaneous observations of both circumstellar dust (via broadband emission) and gas (via emission lines) around a polluted white dwarf. From the optical spectra the gaseous emission lines, notably the calcium infrared triplet and magnesium lines, show significant increases and decreases in their strength over timescales of weeks, while the oxygen and iron lines remain relatively stable. Near-infrared JHKs photometry reveals dust emission changes of up to 0.2 magnitudes in the Ks band over similar timescales, marking the shortest variability timescales observed to date. The two epochs with the strongest emission were correlated between the dust (Ks band brightening) and gas (strengthened calcium and magnesium lines), showing for the first time that the dust and gas must be produced near-simultaneously with a common origin, likely in collisions.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. The impact of rotation and magnetic fields on the radial velocity jitter in cool stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) jitter represents an intrinsic limitation on the precision of Doppler searches for exoplanets that can originate from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. We aim to determine the RV jitter floor in M dwarfs and investigate the stellar properties that lead to RV jitter induced by stellar activity. We determined the RV jitter in 239 M dwarfs from the CARMENES survey that are predominantly of mid to late spectral type and solar metallicity. We also investigated the correlation between stellar rotation and magnetic fields with RV jitter. The median jitter in the CARMENES sample is 3.1 m/s, and it is 2.3 m/s for stars with an upper limit of 2 km/s on their projected rotation velocities. We provide a relation between the stellar equatorial rotation velocity and RV jitter in M dwarfs based on a subsample of 129 well-characterized CARMENES stars. RV jitter induced by stellar rotation dominates for stars with equatorial rotation velocities greater than 1 km/s. A jitter floor of 2 m/s dominates in stars with equatorial rotation velocities below 1 km/s. This jitter floor likely contains contributions from stellar jitter, instrumental jitter, and undetected companions. We study the impact of the average magnetic field and the distributions of magnetic filling factors on the RV jitter. We find a series of stars with excess RV jitter and distinctive distributions of magnetic filling factors. These stars are characterized by a dominant magnetic field component between 2-4 kG. An RV jitter floor can be distinguished from RV jitter induced by activity and rotation based on the stellar equatorial rotation velocity. RV jitter induced by activity and rotation primarily depends on the equatorial rotation velocity. This RV jitter is also related to the distribution of magnetic filling factors, and this emphasizes the role of the magnetic field in the generation of RV jitter.</description>

      <title>A New Strategy for the Exploration of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2023-2032 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey Origins, Worlds, and Life recommended that "NASA develop scientific exploration strategies, as it has for Mars, in areas of broad scientific importance, e.g., Venus... that have an increasing number of U.S. missions and international collaboration opportunities" (OWL, p.22-10). In NASA's initial responses to that Decadal Survey, the agency asserted that "...specific scientific exploration strategies should be community generated by bodies such as the Analysis Groups," thus placing the onus on the planetary community to generate and support these exploration strategies. In late 2022, the Venus Exploration Analysis Group began a project to develop a new exploration strategy for Venus, reflecting the 2021 selections of the VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision missions and the sweeping comparative planetology recommendations relevant to Venus in Origins, Worlds, and Life.
  This is that strategy.
  Taking a broad look at the scientific, technological, and programmatic advances required to address the key outstanding questions that Venus poses, and predicated on VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision flying as planned in the early 2030s, this report outlines a set of actions available to NASA, VEXAG, and the planetary science community at large to establish a sustained program of Venus exploration in the years and decades ahead. Key to this approach is recognizing Venus as a unique setting where multiple, cross-disciplinary, Decadal-level planetary, Earth, heliophysics, and exoplanet science questions can be addressed, as well as being a worthy target of exploration in its own right.
  This report offers Assessments of the current state of Venus exploration, and Actions for the U.S. and international Venus community, as well as NASA, to consider. This strategy is a living document and should be updated as warranted.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum III: Precessing Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically and solved for both rotating and librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs) with high eccentricities. We describe the finding of a striking similarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession rates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC frequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve the resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and explain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the regular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple pendulum.</description>

      <title>Dazzle: Oversampled Image Reconstruction and Difference-Imaging Photometry for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present algorithms and software for constructing high-precision difference images to detect and measure transients, such as microlensing events, in crowded stellar fields using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Our method generates difference images by subtracting an over-sampled reference, with iterative masking to address outlier pixels. We also provide an analytic correction for small dither offset errors. Microlensing event detection is achieved through a three-dimensional matched-filtering technique, optimized with Gaussian kernels to capture varying event durations, and verified through synthetic tests with high recovery rates. Transient photometry is performed via PSF fitting on difference images, using Nelder-Mead optimization for sub-pixel accuracy. The software, Dazzle, is available as an open-source Python package built on widely used libraries, offering accessible tools for the detection and characterization of transient phenomena in crowded fields.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO observations of the debris-accreting white dwarf WD\,0141--675</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Linear bending wave propagation in laminar and turbulent discs</title>

Abstract: Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Young 2 Cygni Run-away Star into a Binary using iLocater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs that use adaptive optics (AO) show promise to advance telescope observing capabilities beyond those of seeing-limited designs. We are building a spectrograph for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) named iLocater that uses AO to inject starlight directly into single mode fibers (SMF). iLocater's first acquisition camera system (the `SX' camera), which receives light from one of the 8.4m diameter primary mirrors of the LBT, was initially installed in summer 2019 and has since been used for several commissioning runs. We present results from first-light observations that include on-sky measurements as part of commissioning activities. Imaging measurements of the bright B3IV star 2 Cygni ($V=4.98$) resulted in the direct detection of a candidate companion star at an angular separation of only $\theta = 70$ mas. Follow-up AO measurements using Keck/NIRC2 recover the candidate companion in multiple filters. An $R\approx1500$ miniature spectrograph recently installed at the LBT named ``Lili'' provides spatially resolved spectra of each binary component, indicating similar spectral types and strengthening the case for companionship. Studying the multiplicity of young runaway star systems like 2 Cygni ($36.6 \pm 0.5$ Myr) can help to understand formation mechanisms for stars that exhibit anomalous velocities through the galaxy. This on-sky demonstration illustrates the spatial resolution of the iLocater SX acquisition camera working in tandem with the LBT AO system; it further derisks a number of technical hurdles involved in combining AO with Doppler spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words detection of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>

      <title>SHAPE -- A Spectro-Polarimeter Onboard Propulsion Module of Chandrayaan-3 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SHAPE (Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth) is an experiment onboard the Chandrayaan-3 Mission, designed to study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the habitable planet Earth in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1.0 - 1.7 $\mu$m). The spectro-polarimeter is the only scientific payload (experimental in nature) on the Propulsion Module (PM) of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The instrument is a compact and lightweight spectro-polarimeter with an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) at its core. The AOTF operates in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 135 MHz with a power of 0.5 - 2.0 Watts. The two output beams (e-beam and o-beam) from the AOTF are focused onto two InGaAs detectors (pixelated, 1D linear array) with the help of focusing optics. The primary (aperture) optics, with a diameter of $\sim$2 mm, collects the NIR light for input to the AOTF, defining the field of view (FOV) of 2.6$^\circ$. The payload has a mass of 4.8 kg and operates at a power of 25 Watts. This manuscript highlights some of the ground-based results, including the post-launch initial performance of the payload while orbiting around the Moon to observe Earth.</description>

      <title>Probability of Collision of satellites and space debris for short-term encounters: Rederivation and fast-to-compute upper and lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in LEO has become a major concern for the space industry. With the growing interest in space exploration, the prediction of potential collisions between objects in orbit has become a crucial issue. It is estimated that, in orbit, there are millions of fragments a few millimeters in size and thousands of inoperative satellites and discarded rocket stages. Given the high speeds that these fragments can reach, even fragments a few millimeters in size can cause fractures in a satellite's hull or put a serious crack in the window of a space shuttle. The conventional method proposed by Akella and Alfriend in 2000 remains widely used to estimate the probability of collision in short-term encounters. Given the small period of time, it is assumed that, during the encounter: (1) trajectories are represented by straight lines with constant velocity; (2) there is no velocity uncertainty and the position exhibits a stationary distribution throughout the encounter; and (3) position uncertainties are independent and represented by Gaussian distributions. This study introduces a novel derivation based on first principles that naturally allows for tight and fast upper and lower bounds for the probability of collision. We tested implementations of both probability and bound computations with the original and our formulation on a real CDM dataset used in ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge. Our approach reduces the calculation of the probability to two one-dimensional integrals and has the potential to significantly reduce the processing time compared to the traditional method, from 80% to nearly real-time.</description>

      <title>Radii, masses, and transit-timing variations of the three-planet system orbiting the naked-eye star TOI-396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-396 is an F6V star ($V\approx6.4$) orbited by three transiting planets. The orbital periods of the two innermost planets are close to the 5:3 commensurability ($P_b \sim3.6$ d and $P_c \sim6.0$ d). To measure the masses of the three planets, refine their radii, and investigate whether planets b and c are in MMR, we carried out HARPS RV observations and retrieved photometric data from TESS. We extracted the RVs via a skew-normal fit onto the HARPS CCFs and performed an MCMC joint analysis of the Doppler measurements and transit photometry, while employing the breakpoint method to remove stellar activity from the RV time series. We also performed a thorough TTV dynamical analysis of the system. Our analysis confirms that the three planets have similar sizes: $R_b=2.004_{-0.047}^{+0.045}R_{\oplus}$; $R_c=1.979_{-0.051}^{+0.054}R_{\oplus}$; $R_d=2.001_{-0.064}^{+0.063}R_{\oplus}$. For the first time, we have determined the RV masses for TOI-396b and d: $M_b=3.55_{-0.96}^{+0.94}M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_b=2.44_{-0.68}^{+0.69}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and $M_d=7.1\pm1.6M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_d=4.9_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$ g cm$^{-3}$). Our results suggest a quite unusual system architecture, with the outermost planet being the densest. The Doppler reflex motion induced by TOI-396c remains undetected in our RV time series, likely due to the proximity of $P_c$ to the star's rotation period ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}=6.7\pm1.3$ d). We also discovered that TOI-396b and c display significant TTVs. While the TTV dynamical analysis returns a formally precise mass for TOI-396c ($M_{c,\mathrm{dyn}}=2.24^{+0.13}_{-0.67}M_{\oplus}$), the result might not be accurate owing to the poor sampling of the TTV phase. We also conclude that TOI-396b and c are close to but out of the 5:3 MMR. Our numerical simulation suggests TTV semi-amplitudes of up to 5 hours over a temporal baseline of $\sim$5.2 years.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including Galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from main-sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties, namely the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red-giant-branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with age measurements from open clusters and asteroseismology. We use "zoomies" to generate and compare dynamical age estimates for stars from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Binary with a Misaligned Circumbinary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of Bernhard-2, which was previously identified as a candidate system to host a misaligned circumbinary disk. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm that Bernhard-2 indeed contains an eccentric ($e=0.69 \pm 0.08$) binary and thus that the periodic variability in the photometric light curve is best explained by the occultation by the misaligned circumbinary disk. By modeling the spectral energy distributions at different phases, we infer the masses of the two binary components to be $\sim 1.1\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. The system age is determined to be $\lesssim$ 20 Myr by combining the stellar isochrone model with lithium abundance. Our new photometric observations show clear deviations from the model prediction based on the archival data, suggesting ongoing precession of the circumbinary disk. The H$\alpha$ line of Bernhard-2 also shows an inverse P-Cygni profile at epochs close to the pericenter passage, which could be attributed to the pulsed accretion around the pericenter. Bernhard-2 therefore closely resembles the well studied KH 15D system. Further detailed observations and studies of such rare systems can provide useful information about disk physics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>
