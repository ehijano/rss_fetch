      <title>Measurement of the flow harmonic correlations via multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport coefficients than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Response of strongly coupled fermions on classical and quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the response of quantum systems is essential for gaining deeper insights into the fundamental nature of matter and its behavior in diverse physical contexts. Computation of nuclear response is critical for many applications, but its spectroscopically accurate description in medium-heavy nuclei in wide energy ranges remains particularly challenging because of the complex nature of nuclear quantum states in the high-level-density regime. Herein, we push the limits of configuration complexity in the classical computation of the nuclear response and present an algorithm with a quantum benefit for treating complex configurations. The classical computational method of approaching spectroscopic accuracy is implemented for medium-heavy nuclei and pioneered for the dipole response of 120Sn, while the quantum algorithm reaching the exact solution is realized for the Lipkin Hamiltonian to unravel the emergence of collectivity at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Results on Elastic Cross Sections in Proton-Proton Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 510$ GeV with the STAR Detector at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results on an elastic cross section measurement in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV, obtained with the Roman Pot setup of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The elastic differential cross section is measured in the four-momentum transfer squared range $0.23 \leq -t \leq 0.67$~GeV$^2$. We find that a constant slope $B$ does not fit the data in the aforementioned $t$ range, and we obtain a much better fit using a second-order polynomial for $B(t)$. The $t$ dependence of $B$ is determined using six subintervals of $t$ in the STAR measured $t$ range, and is in good agreement with the phenomenological models. The measured elastic differential cross section $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{dt}$ agrees well with the results obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 546$~GeV for proton--antiproton collisions by the UA4 experiment. We also determine that the integrated elastic cross section within the STAR $t$-range is $\sigma^\mathrm{fid}_\mathrm{el} = 462.1 \pm 0.9 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 1.1 (\mathrm {syst.}) \pm 11.6 (\mathrm {scale})$~$\mu\mathrm{b}$.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic nuclear reduction for tensor couplings in dark matter direct detection and $\mu \to e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nonrelativistic Effective Theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study bridges this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. We find additional operators in the $\mu \to e$ conversion that are not present in the scalar and vector couplings. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Global data-driven determination of baryon transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>
