      <title>General Chen's First Inequalities for Riemannian Submersions and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and develop the concepts of Chen's first inequalities for Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds. We derive general forms of Chen's first inequalities and analyse their corresponding equality cases. As applications, we apply them to various Riemannian submersions whose total space is real, complex, generalised Sasakian, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and $C(\alpha)$ space forms. We construct examples that satisfy the assumptions of the theorems; we observe that equality holds in some examples, while in others it does not.</description>

      <title>Constant curvature rotational nets and periodic B\"acklund transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After giving explicit parametrizations of discrete constant negative Gaussian curvature surfaces (negative CGC, i.e. discrete pseudospherical surfaces) of revolution, we construct B\"acklund transformations that again will have explicit parametrizations and are new examples of non-rotational discrete pseudospherical surfaces. In the process of doing this, for discrete CGC circular nets, we can provide rotationally invariant families of flat connections and give conditions on them so that the B\"acklund transformations preserve periodicity, that is, have annular topology.</description>

      <title>Singularities on timelike minimal surfaces in Lorentzian Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timelike minimal surfaces in the three-dimensional Lorentzian Heisenberg group are shown to be constructed from Lorentzian harmonic maps into the de-Sitter two-sphere, and they naturally admit singular points. In particular, we provide criteria for cuspidal edges, swallowtails, and cuspidal cross caps, and present several explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Framed null curves and timelike surfaces via Lorentzian harmonic maps into de-Sitter 2-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of Lorentzian harmonic maps into the de-Sitter $2$-space satisfying the eigenvalue equation $\Box N=2H^2N$ for the d'Alambert operator $\Box$ and a non-zero constant $H$ from framed null curves. We also investigate two classes of timelike surfaces associated with these Lorentzian harmonic maps: the first one is timelike surfaces with constant mean curvature $H$ in Lorentz-Minkowski $3$-space and the second one is timelike minimal surfaces in the three-dimensional Lorentzian Heisenberg group $\operatorname{Nil}_3(H)$. In particular, we characterize some properties of singularities on timelike minimal surfaces in $\operatorname{Nil}_3(H)$ via an invariant of framed null curves.</description>

      <title>An Inequality Comparing the Dirichlet Energy and the Bienergy of Maps Between Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a geometric inequality relating the Dirichlet energy $E_1(f)$ and the bienergy $E_2(f)$ of smooth maps \[ f : (M,g) \to (\overline{M},\overline{g}) \] between Riemannian manifolds. Assume that $(M,g)$ is a compact, connected Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature has global minimum $\operatorname{Ric}_{\min}$, and that the target manifold $(\overline{M},\overline{g})$ has non-positive sectional curvature along $f(M)$. We prove that \[ E_2(f) \ge \operatorname{Ric}_{\min}\, E_1(f). \] We further analyze the equality case and obtain rigidity results: equality holds if and only if $f$ is totally geodesic and of constant rank. Applications to maps into Hadamard manifolds are also presented.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric inequality directly relating the Dirichlet energy and the bienergy of smooth maps. This result establishes a direct connection between the Ricci curvature of the domain and higher-order variational energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a precompactness theorem for invariant metrics on compact homogeneous spaces without injectivity radius bounds, assuming uniform bounds on the diameter and on all derivatives of the curvature tensor. As a consequence, we prove that every ancient homogeneous Ricci flow on a compact manifold admits a blow-down sequence that converges to a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton.</description>

As a corollary, we provide a dimension-dependent constant $\delta(n)$ and prove that there exist no non-flat weakly stable Yang-Mills connections on $\delta(n)$-pinched compact simply-connected Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Generic neck pinch singularities along 2D Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of nondegenerate neck pinch singularity along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow of surfaces in a Calabi-Yau surface. We show that such singularities can occur, are stable under small perturbations, and any neck pinch singularity can be perturbed to such a nondegenerate singularity near the singular time. Using this we answer some questions raised by Neves and Joyce. We also introduce nondegenerate teardrop singularities and show that these cannot occur for embedded flows.</description>

      <title>General Casorati Inequality for Riemannian Submersions Involving Horizontal and Vertical Casorati Curvatures and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and introduce a Casorati inequality for Riemannian submersions involving the Casorati curvatures of both the vertical and horizontal distributions. A general form of the inequality is derived for Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds, and the corresponding equality cases are completely characterised. As applications, we obtain the inequality for Riemannian submersions whose total spaces are real, complex, generalised Sasakian, Sasakian, cosymplectic, Kenmotsu, and almost $c(\alpha)$-space forms. For each theorem, we present illustrative examples. Some of these examples achieve equality, while others do not. Furthermore, these inequalities are derived for invariant, anti-invariant, slant, semi-slant, hemi-slant, and bi-slant Riemannian submersions.</description>

      <title>Dolbeault-Dirac operators on compact K\"ahler manifolds in Banach noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an $\mathrm{L}^p$-theory for Dolbeault-Dirac operators on compact K\"ahler manifolds with coefficients in a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E$. For each $p \in (1,\infty)$ we consider the closed $\mathrm{L}^p$-realization $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_{E}$ on the Banach space $\mathrm{L}^p(\Omega^{0,\bullet}(M,E))$. We prove that $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ is bisectorial and admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty$ functional calculus. We establish a Gaffney-type estimate controlling covariant derivatives in $\mathrm{L}^p$, and also obtain $\mathrm{L}^p$-Hodge decompositions. As an application, we show that the closed operator $\mathcal{D}_{E,p}$ yields a compact Banach spectral triple, and we identify the index of the associated Fredholm operator with the holomorphic Euler characteristic, proving in particular that it is independent of $p$. This work initiates a connection between complex geometry, $\mathrm{L}^p$-analysis and Banach noncommutative geometry, beyond the Hilbert space setting.</description>

      <title>Conformal Metrics on the Disk with Prescribed Negative Gaussian Curvature and Boundary Geodesic Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of prescribing the Gaussian curvature on the disk and the geodesic curvature on its boundary via a conformal change of the metric. In this paper the case of negative Gaussian curvature is treated, a regime for which the bubbling behavior of approximate solutions is not so well understood. This is due to the possible appearance of blow-up solutions with diverging length and area. We give an existence result under assumptions on the curvatures which are somewhat natural, in view of some obstructions inherent to the problem. Our strategy is variational and relies on the study of certain families of approximated problems. By performing a refined blow-up analysis for solutions with bounded Morse index, we conclude compactness.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the behavior of Urysohn width of manifolds under a connected sum operation, specifically, bounding widths of summands in terms of widths of the sum and vice versa. Our methods also apply to the universal covers of these spaces, and to more general type of surgeries. Lastly, we provide examples that show the optimality of constants in our estimates.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of projected Hamiltonian orbits in cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generic behavior of Hamiltonian trajectories on a regular level set in the cotangent bundle, after projection to the base. We prove that for a generic submersive level set, projected trajectories have discrete (self-)intersections. Additionally, fixing end-point fibers, we prove that all intersections can be perturbed away if the base has dimension at least three. In particular, this applies to periodic orbits, and both results hold for Reeb flows on fiber-wise star-shaped hypersurfaces, including non-reversible Finsler flows, which answers a question of Rademacher. In the proof we make use of a multi-jet transversality theorem.</description>

      <title>Timelike bounce hypersurfaces in charged null dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\mu\nu}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.</description>

Abstract: Differentiating an Lie $n$-groupoid via the differential-geometric fat point a priori only yielads a presheaf of graded manifolds. In this article we prove that this presheaf is representable by the tangent complex of the Lie $n$-groupoid.

Abstract: It has recently been proved that the category of N-manifolds of degree $n$, that is, $\mathbb N$-graded supermanifolds of degree $n$ for which the parity agrees with the gradation, is equivalent to the category of purely even $n$-tuple vector superbundles equipped with a suitable action of the symmetric group $S_n$ permuting the vector bundle structures. This equivalence may be interpreted as a `desuperization' of N-manifolds. In the present paper, we place this result within a broader framework of graded structures on supermanifolds and explicitly describe several canonical equivalences between the corresponding categories in a purely geometric, constructive manner. The desuperization equivalence functor appears as a composition of some of these canonical equivalences. Our constructions are entirely canonical and rely on standard tools of supergeometry, including iterated tangent functors, parity reversion in vector superbundles, and the interpretation of $n$-tuple vector bundles in terms of commuting Euler vector fields associated with the underlying vector bundle structures.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Minimizing Diffeomorphisms on a $G_2$-Manifold</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct infinitely many diffeomorphisms of a Joyce manifold $M$ which achieve Yomdin's homological lower bound for topological entropy, imitating a recent construction of Farb-Looijenga for K3 surfaces. Moreover, following a recent paper by Crowley-Goette-Hertl, we show these diffeomorphisms act freely on a connected component of the Teichm\"uller space of $G_2$ structures on $M$, and hence that the homotopy moduli space of $G_2$ structures on $M$ has infinite fundamental group. We also discuss a putative analogy between dynamics on a $G_2$ manifold and that of an algebraic surface, and prove a theorem about its limitations.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16479</link>

Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counter-examples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using \emph{floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue optimization in higher dimensions and $p$-harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence results for optimization problems for the $k$th Laplace eigenvalue on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $m \geq 3$, depending on the choice of normalization. One such normalization leads to eigenvalue optimization within a conformal class, for which existence of maximizers was previously known only in dimension two. We also prove that all absolutely continuous maximizers of the normalized eigenvalue functionals are always induced by $p$-harmonic maps into spheres, where $p \in [2,m]$. For $p$ sufficiently close to $m$, the maximizers are always H\"older-continuous, whereas for $p&lt;m$ no bubbling occurs. A key tool in our analysis is the application of techniques from the theory of topological tensor products, which appear to be well suited for studying eigenvalue-related optimization problems.</description>
