      <title>Chow stability of $\lambda$-stable toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given polarized toric variety, we define the notion of $\lambda$-stability which is a natural generalization of uniform K-stability. At the neighbourhoods of the vertices of the corresponding moment polytope $\Delta$, we consider appropriate triangulations and give a sufficient criteria for a $\lambda$-stable polarized toric variety $(X,L)$ to be asymptotically Chow polystable when the obstruction of asymptotic Chow semistability (the Futaki-Ono invariant) vanishes. As an application, we prove that any K-semistable polarized smooth toric variety $(X,L)$ with the vanishing Futaki-Ono invariant is asymptotically Chow polystable.</description>

      <title>Belyi Function Decompositions for The Icosahedron of Genus 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The icosahedron $I_4$ of genus 4 is a dessin d'enfant embedded in Bring's curve $\mathcal{B}$. The dessin $I_4$ is related in some sense to a regular icosahedron $I_0$ embedded in the complex Riemann sphere. In particular, decompositions of Belyi functions $\beta_{I_0}: \mathbb{CP}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\beta_{I_4}: \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1$ for $I_0$ and $I_4$ have the same lattice. The diagram of $\beta_{I_0}$ decompositions is already known. In the present paper we find $\beta_{I_4}$ decompositions. Note that $\beta_{I_0}$ decomposes into rational functions on $\mathbb{C}P^1$, while in case of $\beta_{I_4}$ we deal with maps between different algebraic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over qcqs finite-dimensional schemes, we prove that \'etale motives of geometric origin can be characterised by a constructibility property which is purely categorical, giving a full answer to the question "Do all constructible \'etale motives come from geometry?" which dates back to Cisinski and D\'eglise's work. We also show that they afford the continuity property and satisfy h-descent and Milnor excision.</description>

      <title>On Epimorphism and related problems for linear hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear hypersurfaces over a field $k$ have been playing a central role in the study of some of the challenging problems on affine spaces. Breakthroughs on such problems have occurred by examining two questions on linear polynomials of the form\\ $H:=\alpha(X_1,\dots,X_m)Y - F(X_1,\dots, X_m,Z,T)\in D:=k[X_1,\ldots,X_m, Y,Z,T]$:
(i) Whether the affine variety $\mathbb{V}\in \mathbb{A}^{m+3}_k$ defined by $H$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^{m+2}_k$.
(ii) If $\mathbb{V}$ is isomorphic to an affine space, then whether $H$ is a coordinate in $D$. In \cite{adv2}, the first two authors had addressed these questions
when $\alpha$ is a monomial of the form $\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_m) = X_1^{r_1}\dots X_m^{r_m}$; $r_i&gt;1,\, 1 \leqslant i \leqslant m$ and $F$ is of a certain type.
  In this paper, using $K$-theory and $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions, we address these questions for a wider family of linear varieties.
  In particular, we show that when the characteristic of $k$ is zero, $F \in k[Z,T]$ and $H$ defines a hyperplane (i.e., the affine variety $\mathbb{V}$ defined by $H$ is an affine space), then $H$
is a coordinate in
$D$ along with $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$. As a consequence we obtain a certain families of higher dimensional linear hyperplanes satisfying the Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture on the Epimorphism Problem. Our results in arbitrary characteristic yield counter examples to the Zariski Cancellation Problem in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Classification of Dupin Cyclidic Cubes by Their Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple orthogonal coordinate systems having coordinate lines as circles or straight lines are considered. Technically, they are represented by trilinear rational quaternionic maps and are called Dupin cyclidic cubes, naturally generalizing the bilinear rational quaternionic parametrizations of principal patches of Dupin cyclides. Dupin cyclidic cubes and their singularities are studied and classified up to M\"obius equivalency in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of full flag varieties, while regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of partial flag varieties. In this manuscript we first provide a summand formula and a product formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. It is well-known that there is an isomorphism between the cohomology rings of partial flag varieties and the invariants in the cohomology rings of full flag varieties under an action of a certain Weyl group by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand. We generalize this result to regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. More concretely, we give an isomorphism between the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties and the invariant subrings of the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties under the certain Weyl group action. Furthermore, we provide a description of the cohomology rings for regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties in terms of the invariants in the logarithmic derivation modules of ideal arrangements, which is a genelarization of the result by Abe-Masuda-Murai-Sato with the author.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 2000s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and the $G$-birational invariants introduced by Kontsevich, Pestun, and Tschinkel in recent pioneering work, along with presenting applications. The final section of this paper explores conjectures and preliminary results regarding gerbes, connections over orbifolds, discrete torsion, and potential approaches via motivic integration and twisted K-theory for $G$-birationality. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite graph $G$, we define the Ceresa period $\alpha(G)$ as a tool for studying algebraic triviality of the tropical Ceresa cycle introduced by Zharkov. We show that $\alpha(G) = 0$ if and only if $G$ is of hyperelliptic type; then a theorem of Corey implies that having $\alpha(G) = 0$ is a minor-closed condition with forbidden minors $K_4$ and $L_3$.</description>

      <title>Equivalent conjectures on blowing-ups of $\mathbb P^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of asymptotical speciality of a nef and big divisor $D$ on an algebraic surface in terms of the arithmetic genus of curves in $D^{\perp}$. As a consequence we prove that the SHGH conjecture for linear systems on the blowing-up $X_r^2$ of the projective plane at points in very general position is equivalent to the fact that each nef class of is non-special. Finally we prove that if $r &lt; 2^n$ then any nef divisor of $X_r^n$ is asymptotically non-special.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the blow-up invariance for Hodge-Witt sheaves with modulus, which is a generalization of a result of Koizumi for Witt sheaves and that of Kelly-Miyazaki and Koizumi for Hodge sheaves. As a consequence, we obtain the representability of Hodge-Witt sheaves with modulus in the category of motives with modulus under the assumption of resolution of singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of multidegrees in families and the existence of numerical criteria to detect integral dependence. We show that mixed multiplicities of modules are upper semicontinuous functions when taking fibers and that projective degrees of rational maps are lower semicontinuous under specialization. We investigate various aspects of the polar multiplicities and Segre numbers of an ideal and introduce a new invariant that we call polar-Segre multiplicities. In terms of polar multiplicities and our new invariants, we provide a new integral dependence criterion for certain families of ideals. By giving specific examples, we show that the Segre numbers are the only invariants among the ones we consider that can detect integral dependence. Finally, we generalize the result of Gaffney and Gassler regarding the lexicographic upper semicontinuity of Segre numbers.</description>

      <title>Spaces of non-resultant systems of real bounded multiplicity determined by a toric variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any field $\Bbb F$ and positive integers $m,n,d$ with $(m,n)\not= (1,1)$, Farb and Wolfson defined the certain affine varieties ${\rm Poly}^{d,m}_n(\Bbb F)$ as generalizations of spaces first studied by Arnold, Vassiliev, Segal and others. As a natural generalization of this, for each fan $\Sigma$ and $r$-tuple $D=(d_1,\cdots ,d_r)$ of positive integers, the current authors defined spaces ${\rm Poly}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$, where $r$ is the number of one dimensional cones in $\Sigma$. These spaces can also be regarded as generalizations of the space ${\rm Hol}^*_D(S^2,X_\Sigma)$ of based rational curves from the Riemann sphere $S^2$ to the toric variety $X_\Sigma$ of degree $D$, where $X_\Sigma$ denotes the toric variety (over $\Bbb C$) corresponding to the fan $\Sigma$. In this paper, we define spaces ${\rm Q}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$ ($\Bbb F=\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$) which are real analogues of ${\rm Poly}^{D,\Sigma}_n(\Bbb F)$ and which can be viewed as a generalizations of spaces considered by Arnold, Vassiliev and others in the context of real singularity theory. We prove that homotopy stability holds for these spaces and compute the stability dimensions explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that a union of upper-level sets associated to fibrewise Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions is in general a pluripolar subset. Then we obtain analyticity theorems for a union of sub-level sets associated to fibrewise complex singularity exponents of some special (quasi-)plurisubharmonic functions. As a corollary, we confirm that, under certain conditions, the logarithmic poles of relative Bergman kernels form an analytic subset when the (quasi-)plurisubharmonic weight function has analytic singularities. In the end, we give counterexamples to show that the aforementioned sets are in general non-analytic even if the plurisubharmonic function is supposed to be continuous.</description>

      <title>A formal categorical approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bicategory which refines the localization of the category of dg categories with respect to quasi-equivalences and investigate its properties via formal category theory. Concretely, we first introduce the bicategory of dg categories $\mathsf{DBimod}$ whose Hom categories are the derived categories of dg bimodules and then define the desired bicategory as the sub-bicategory $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr}$ consisting only of right quasi-representable dg bimodules. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of adjunctions and equivalences in these bicategories. We then show that the embedding $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{DBimod}$ is a proarrow equipment in the sense of Richard J. Wood, which is a framework for formal category theory and makes it possible to talk about (weighted) (co)limits in an abstract way. Thus we obtain the notion of homotopical (co)limits in a dg category, including homotopical shifts and cones, by which we obtain a formal categorical characterization of pretriangulated dg categories. As an immediate application we give a conceptual proof of the fact that the pretriangulatedness is preserved under the gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>A guide to tropical modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:1509.03443v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper surveys {\it tropical modifications}, which have already become a folklore in tropical geometry. Tropical modifications are used in tropical intersection theory, tropical Hodge theory, and in the study of singularities. They admit interpretations in various contexts, such as hyperbolic geometry, Berkovich spaces, and non-standard analysis.
  Our main goal is to mention different points of view, to give references, and to demonstrate the abilities of tropical modifications. We assume that the reader has already met ``tropical modifications'' somewhere and wants to understand them better.
  There are novelties here: a new obstruction to the realizability of non-transversal intersections and a tropical version of Weil's reciprocity law.</description>

Abstract: Minimal algebraic surfaces of general type $X$ such that $K^2_X=2\chi(\mathcal{O}_X)-6$ are called Horikawa surfaces. In this note the group of automorphisms of Horikawa surfaces is studied. The main result states that given an admissible pair $(K^2, \chi)$ such that $K^2=2\chi-6$, every irreducible component of Gieseker's moduli space $\mathfrak{M}_{K^2,\chi}$ contains an open subset consisting of surfaces with group of automorphisms isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hodge conjecture for powers of K3 surfaces and show that if the Kuga--Satake correspondence is algebraic for a family of K3 surfaces of generic Picard number 16, then the Hodge conjecture holds for all powers of any K3 surface in that family.</description>

      <title>Orbit closures in flag varieties for the centralizer of an order-two nilpotent element : normality and resolutions for types A, B, D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a reductive algebraic group in classical types A, B, D and e be an element of its Lie algebra with Z its centraliser in G for the adjoint action. We suppose that e identifies with an nilpotent matrix of order two, which guarantees the number of Z-orbits in the flag variety of G is finite. For types B, D in characteristic two, we also suppose the image of e is totally isotropic. We show that any closure Y of such orbit is normal. We also prove that Y is Cohen-Macaulay with rational singularities provided that the base field is of characteristic zero, and that Cohen-Macaulayness remains in any characteristic for type A. We exhibit a birational, rational morphism onto Y involving Schubert varieties. Our work generalizes a result by N. Perrin and E. Smirnov on Springer fibers ([PS12]).</description>

      <title>Some interesting birational morphisms of smooth affine quadric $3$-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of birational maps of smooth affine quadric 3-folds, {over the complex numbers}, of the form $x_1x_4-x_2x_3=$ constant, which seems to have some (among many others) interesting/unexpected characters: a) they are cohomologically hyperbolic, b) their second dynamical degree is an algebraic number but not an algebraic integer, and c) the logarithmic growth of their periodic points is strictly smaller than their algebraic entropy. These maps are restrictions of a polynomial map on $\mathbb{C}^4$ preserving each of the quadrics. The study in this paper is a mixture of rigorous and experimental ones, where for the experimental study we rely on Bertini which is a reliable and fast software for expensive numerical calculations in complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Embedded $\mathbb{Q}$-desingularization of real Schubert varieties and application to the relative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraicity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algebraic set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of dimension $d$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic set if it can be described, both globally and locally, by polynomial equations with rational coefficients. We prove that every nonsingular real algebraic set $V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with nonsingular algebraic subsets $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ in general position is Nash diffeomorphic to a $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic set $V'\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic subsets $\{V'_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ in general position and the Nash diffeomorphism $h:V\to V'$ sends each $V_i$ to $V_i'$, where $m:=\max\{n,2d+1\}$, if $V$ is compact, or $m:=n+2d+3$, otherwise. As a byproduct we obtain $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relative version of Nash-Tognoli theorem for compact manifolds. A key result in the proof is the description of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-homological cycles of real Grassmannian manifolds by $\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic representatives via an explicit desingularization of real embedded Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>On the local dimensions of solutions of Brent equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\langle m,n,p \rangle$ be the matrix multiplication tensor. The solution set of Brent equations corresponds to the tensor decompositions of $\langle m,n,p \rangle$. We study the local dimensions of solutions of the Brent equations over the field of complex numbers. The rank of Jacobian matrix of Brent equations provides an upper bound of the local dimension, which is well-known. We calculate the ranks for some typical known solutions, which are provided in the databases \cite{Faw22+} and \cite{Heule19}. We show that the automorphism group of the natural algorithm computing $\langle m,n,p \rangle$ is $(\mathcal{P}_m\times \mathcal{P}_n\times \mathcal{P}_p)\rtimes Q(m,n,p)$, where $\mathcal{P}_m$, $\mathcal{P}_n$ and $\mathcal{P}_p$ are groups of generalised permutation matrices, $Q(m,n,p)$ is a subgroup of $S_3$ depending on $m$, $n$ and $p$. For other algorithms computing $\langle m,n,p \rangle$, some conditions are given, which imply the corresponding automorphism groups are isomorphic to subgroups of $(\mathcal{P}_m\times \mathcal{P}_n\times \mathcal{P}_p)\rtimes Q(m,n,p)$. So under these conditions, $m^2+n^2+p^2-m-n-p-3$ is a lower bound for the local dimensions of solutions of Brent equations. Moreover, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the conjecture claiming that, over a flexible field, isotropic Chow groups coincide with numerical Chow groups (with ${\Bbb{F}}_p$-coefficients). This shows that Isotropic Chow motives coincide with Numerical Chow motives. In particular, homs between such objects are finite groups and $\otimes$ has no zero-divisors. It provides a large supply of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Voevodsky motivic category. We also prove the Morava K-theory version of the above result, which permits to construct plenty of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Morel-Voevodsky ${\Bbb{A}}^1$-stable homotopic category. This substantially improves our understanding of the mentioned spectra whose description is a major open problem.</description>

Abstract: Let $d$ and $n$ be positive integers, and $E/F$ be a separable field extension of degree $m=\binom{n+d}{n}$. We show that if $|F| &gt; 2$, then there exists a point $P\in \mathbb{P}^n(E)$ which does not lie on any degree $d$ hypersurface defined over $F$. In other words, the $m$ Galois conjugates of $P$ impose independent conditions on the $m$-dimensional $F$-vector space of degree $d$ forms in $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$. As an application, we determine the maximal dimensions of linear systems $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^n$ over a finite field $F$, where every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_1$ is reducible and every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_2$ is irreducible.</description>

      <title>Covering Number of Real Algebraic Varieties and Beyond: Improved Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covering numbers are a powerful tool used in the development of approximation algorithms, randomized dimension reduction methods, smoothed complexity analysis, and others. In this paper we prove upper bounds on the covering number of numerous sets in Euclidean space, namely real algebraic varieties, images of polynomial maps and semialgebraic sets in terms of the number of variables and degrees of the polynomials involved. The bounds remarkably improve the best known general bound by Yomdin-Comte, and our proof is much more straightforward. In particular, our result gives new bounds on the volume of the tubular neighborhood of the image of a polynomial map and a semialgebraic set, where results for varieties by Lotz and Basu-Lerario are not directly applicable. We illustrate the power of the result on three computational applications. Firstly, we derive a near-optimal bound on the covering number of low rank CP tensors, quantifying their approximation properties and filling in an important missing piece of theory for tensor dimension reduction and reconstruction. Secondly, we prove a bound on the required dimension for the randomized sketching of polynomial optimization problems, which controls how much computation can be saved through randomization without sacrificing solution quality. Finally, we deduce generalization error bounds for deep neural networks with rational or ReLU activation functions, improving or matching the best known results in the machine learning literature while helping to quantify the impact of architecture choice on generalization error.</description>

Abstract: Let X be a non singular projective surface. Given a semistable non isotrivial fibration f over a smooth rational curve with general fiber non hyperelliptic of genus g bigger than 3, we show that if the number s of singular fibers is 5, then the genus is less or equal to 11, thus improving the previously known bound (g lesser or equal to 17). Furthermore we show that for each possible genus the general fiber has gonality at most 5 and we describe the corresponding fibrations as the resolution of concrete pencils of curves on minimal rational surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Grothendieck polynomials appearing in the K-theory of Grassmannians, which are analogs of Schur polynomials. This paper aims to establish a version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian type. This rule allows us to express the product of a Grothendieck polynomial with a power sum symmetric polynomial into a linear combination of other Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Sampson Approximations for Geometric Estimation Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems in computer vision can be formulated as geometric estimation problems, i.e. given a collection of measurements (e.g. point correspondences) we wish to fit a model (e.g. an essential matrix) that agrees with our observations. This necessitates some measure of how much an observation ``agrees" with a given model. A natural choice is to consider the smallest perturbation that makes the observation exactly satisfy the constraints. However, for many problems, this metric is expensive or otherwise intractable to compute. The so-called Sampson error approximates this geometric error through a linearization scheme. For epipolar geometry, the Sampson error is a popular choice and in practice known to yield very tight approximations of the corresponding geometric residual (the reprojection error).
  In this paper we revisit the Sampson approximation and provide new theoretical insights as to why and when this approximation works, as well as provide explicit bounds on the tightness under some mild assumptions. Our theoretical results are validated in several experiments on real data and in the context of different geometric estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Two Formulas for the Number of Lines on Complex Projective Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13206v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Dominici, Harris, Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. We review the splitting principle computation by Harris obtaining a similar general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this combinatorial interpretation for the cases of 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>

Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

      <title>Whittaker vectors at finite energy scale, topological recursion and Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hbar$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <title>Character Sheaves on Reductive Lie Algebras in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a microlocal characterisation of character sheaves on a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of sufficiently large positive characteristic: a perverse irreducible G-equivariant sheaf is a character sheaf if and only if it has nilpotent singular support and is quasi-admissible. We also present geometric proofs, in positive characteristic, of the equivalence between being admissible and being a character sheaf, and various characterisations of cuspidal sheaves, following the work of Mirkovi\'c.</description>
