      <title>Screened Thin-Target Bremsstrahlung with Partially-Ionized High-Z Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bremsstrahlung emission remains a cornerstone process in the characterization of electron dynamics in diverse high-energy environments. In particular, the accurate description of thin-target electron-ion bremsstrahlung in the presence of high-$Z$ species requires careful treatment of atomic screening effects, especially when atoms are partially ionized. We present a fully analytic screening model based on a multi-Yukawa representation of the atomic potential, enabling the calculation of bremsstrahlung cross sections for arbitrary nuclear charge and ionization state, and electron energies up to a few tens of MeV. This framework extends prior treatments of neutral atoms to include partially ionized high-$Z$ elements in a fully analytic framework.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic corrections to electric quadrupole transition rates in H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive formulas and perform calculations of nonadiabatic corrections to rates of electric quadrupole transitions in the hydrogen molecule. These corrections can be represented in terms of the quadrupole moment curve $D^{(1)}(R)$, similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer one, $D^{(0)}(R)$, derived originally by Wolniewicz. Numerical results change E2 transition rates for the fundamental band by as much as 0.4 - 12\% depending on rotational quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Electron juggling: Approaching the atomic physics limit of the attempt rate in trapped ion photonic interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic interconnects are a key technology for scaling up atomic based quantum computers. By facilitating the connection of multiple systems, high-performance modular quantum processing units may be constructed to perform deeper and more useful algorithms. Most previous implementations of photonic interconnects in trapped ions utilize the scheme of preparing a state, exciting it, and collecting single photons from decays of the excited state. State preparation is responsible for the vast majority of the total attempt time, often taking hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. Here, we describe and analyze a novel technique called ``electron juggling" to speed up photonic interconnects by reducing the state preparation step substantially. Using a theoretical framework, we illustrate how this scheme can significantly increase remote entanglement generation rates, approaching the atomic physics limit of the attempt rate in trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Our results indicate that this scheme holds the possibility of achieving remote entanglement generation rates of over 1,000 Bell pairs per second.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of rotating fermionic superfluids by Sagnac phonon interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02664v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unidirectionality and phase separation in optically dense emitter ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transmission of light through an ensemble of two-level emitters in a one-dimensional geometry is commonly described by one of two emblematic models of quantum electrodynamics (QED): the driven-dissipative Dicke model or the Maxwell-Bloch equations. Both exhibit distinct features of phase transitions and phase separations, depending on system parameters such as optical depth and external drive strength. Here, we explore the crossover between these models via a parent spin model from bidirectional waveguide QED, by varying positional disorder among emitters. Solving mean-field equations and employing a second-order cumulant expansion for the unidirectional model -- equivalent to the Maxwell-Bloch equations -- we study phase diagrams, the emitter's inversion, and transmission depending on optical depth, drive strength, and spatial disorder. We find in the thermodynamic limit the emergence of phase separation with a critical value that depends on the degree of spatial order but is independent of Doppler broadening effects. Even far from the thermodynamic limit, this critical value marks a special point in the emitter's correlation landscape of the unidirectional model and is also observed as a maximum in the magnitude of inelastically transmitted photons. We conclude that a large class of effective one-dimensional systems without tight control of the emitter's spatial ordering can be effectively modeled using a unidirectional waveguide approach.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase in anisotropic Kepler problem: Perspective for realization in Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states with a large principal quantum number a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the widely used Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of stochastic pure-state trajectories and the corresponding continuous measurement protocols, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>
