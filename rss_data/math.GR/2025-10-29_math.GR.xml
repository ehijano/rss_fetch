      <title>Projective simplicity and Bergman's property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the projective unit group $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$, i.e., the quotient of the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ modulo its center, of any non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ is simple. Moreover, we show that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has uncountable strong cofinality, that is, it is not the union of a countable chain of proper subgroups and it has finite width with respect to any generating set. Equivalently, every isometric action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ on a metric space has bounded orbits. It follows that every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by isometries on a non-empty complete $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space admits a fixed point. In particular, $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ possesses Serre's properties $(FH)$ and $(FA)$. Furthermore, our results entail that $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$ has bounded normal generation. In turn, we answer two questions by Carderi and Thom.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous ping-pong for finite subgroups of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski-dense subgroup of a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ defined over a field $F$. Given a finite collection of finite subgroups $H_i$ ($i \in I$) of $\mathbf{G}(F)$ avoiding the center, we establish a criterion to ensure that the set of elements of $\Gamma$ that form a free product with every $H_i$ (the so-called simultaneous ping-pong partners for $H_i$) is both Zariski- and profinitely dense in $\Gamma$. This criterion applies namely to direct products $\mathbf{G}$ of inner $\mathbb{R}$-forms of $\operatorname{(P)GL}_n$, and gives a positive answer to this particular case of a question asked by Bekka, Cowling and de la Harpe. For torsion elements, a complication arises due to the fact that a finite cyclic group can split into a direct product. When $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of a semisimple algebra, we also give a more explicit method to obtain free products between two given finite subgroups, via first-order deformations.
  In the second half, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of the group algebra $FG$ of a finite group $G$, and $\Gamma$ is the group of units of an order in $FG$. In this regard, we prove that the set of bicylic units that play ping-pong with a given shifted bicyclic unit, is Zariski- and profinitely dense, addressing a long-standing belief in the field of group rings. This result is deduced from the criterion above, combined with sharp existence results for well-behaved irreducible representations of $G$ that are center-preserving on a given subgroup.</description>

      <title>Classifications of dimonoids with at most three elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present complete classifications, up to isomorphism, of all two-element dimonoids, all commutative three-element dimonoids, and all abelian three-element dimonoids. We show that, up to isomorphism, there exist exactly 8 two-element dimonoids, of which 3 are commutative. Among these, 4 are abelian, and the remaining nonabelian dimonoids form 2 pairs of dual dimonoids. Furthermore, there are exactly 5 pairwise nonisomorphic trivial dimonoids of order 2. For dimonoids of order 3, we prove that there are precisely 14 pairwise nonisomorphic commutative dimonoids, including 12 trivial dimonoids and a single pair of nonabelian nontrivial dual dimonoids. We also establish that, up to isomorphism, there are 17 abelian dimonoids of order 3, consisting of 12 trivial commutative dimonoids and 5 noncommutative nontrivial ones. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of at least 26 pairwise nonisomorphic nonabelian noncommutative dimonoids of order 3. Among them, there are exactly 6 pairs of trivial dual dimonoids and at least 7 pairs of nontrivial dual dimonoids.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and flexibility results for groups with a common cocompact envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A locally compact group $G$ is a cocompact envelope of a group $\Gamma$ if $G$ contains a copy of $\Gamma$ as a discrete and cocompact subgroup. We study the problem that takes two finitely generated groups $\Gamma,\Lambda$ having a common cocompact envelope, and asks what properties must be shared between $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$.
  We first consider the setting where the common cocompact envelope is totally disconnected. In that situation we show that if $\Gamma$ admits a finitely generated nilpotent normal subgroup $A$, then virtually $\Lambda$ admits a normal subgroup $B$ such that $A$ and $B$ are virtually isomorphic.
  We establish both rigidity and flexibility results when $\Gamma$ belongs to the class of solvable groups of finite rank. On the rigidity perspective, we show that if $\Gamma$ is solvable of finite rank, and the locally finite radical of $\Lambda$ is finite, then $\Lambda$ must be virtually solvable of finite rank. On the flexibility perspective, we exhibit groups $\Gamma,\Lambda$ with a common cocompact envelope such that $\Gamma$ is solvable of finite rank, while $\Lambda$ is not virtually solvable. In particular the class of solvable groups of finite rank is not QI-rigid. We also exhibit flexibility behaviours among finitely presented groups, and more generally among groups with type $F_n$ for arbitrary $n \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of completely 0-simple semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study commuting graphs of completely $0$-simple semigroups, using the characterization of these semigroups as $0$-Rees matrix semigroups over a groups. We establish a method to decide whether the commuting graph of this semigroup construction is connected or not. If it is not connected, we also supply a way to identify the connected components of the commuting graph. We show how to obtain the diameter of the commuting graph (when it is connected) and the diameters of the connected components of the commuting graph (when it is not connected). Moreover, we obtain the clique number and girth of the commuting graph of such a semigroup, as well as two upper bounds (either of which can be the best in different situations) for its chromatic number. We also determine the knit degree of such a semigroup.
  Finally, we use the results regarding the properties of the commuting graph of a $0$-Rees matrix semigroup over a group to determine the set of possible values for the diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree of the commuting graph of a completely $0$-simple semigroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for every finitely generated group quasi-isometric to the mapping class group of a surface, there is a collection of subgroups such that their coset intersection complex is combinatorially equivalent to the curve complex, in the sense that one can be obtained from the other via taking a nerve. We also prove that the automorphism group of this coset intersection complex is the extended mapping class group, providing new evidence for Ivanov's metaconjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the space $Q_n$ of all configurations of $n$ ordered points on the circle such that no three points coincide, and in which one of the points (say, the last one) is fixed. We compute its fundamental group for $n&lt;6$ and describe its homology for $n=6,7$. For arbitrary $n$, we compute its first homology and its Euler characteristic.
  We use three geometric approaches. On one hand, $Q_n$ is naturally defined as the complement to an arrangement of codimension-2 subtori in a real torus. On the other hand, $Q_n$ is homotopy equivalent to an explicit nonpositively curved cubical complex. Finally, $Q_n$ can also be assembled from no-3-equal manifolds of the real line.
  We also observe that, up to homotopy, $Q_n$ may be identified with a subspace of the oriented double cover of the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}(\mathbb{R})$ of stable real rational curves with $n$ marked points. This gives an embedding of $\pi_1 Q_n$ into the pure cactus group. As a corollary, we see that $\pi_1 Q_n$ is residually nilpotent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of dimonoids, algebraic structures with two associative binary operations that satisfy a prescribed system of axioms. We investigate the properties of dual dimonoids. In the class of noncommutative dimonoids, we construct a number of abelian, nonabelian, and rectangular dimonoids. The structure of these objects is analyzed, their automorphism groups and halos are computed.</description>

      <title>Virtual retractions in free constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group $G$ has property (VRC) if every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract. This property is stable under many standard group-theoretic constructions and is enjoyed by all virtually special groups (in the sense of Haglund and Wise). In this paper we study property (VRC) for fundamental groups of finite graphs of groups.
  Our main criterion shows that the fundamental group of a finite graph of finitely generated virtually abelian groups has (VRC) if and only if it has a homomorphism to a Euclidean-by-finite group that is injective on all vertex groups. This result allows us to determine property (VRC) for such groups using basic tools from Euclidean Geometry and Linear Algebra. We use it to produce examples and to give sufficient criteria for fundamental groups of finite graphs of finitely generated abelian groups with cyclic edge groups to have (VRC).
  In the last two sections and in the appendix we give applications of property (VRC). We show that if a fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with finitely generated virtually abelian vertex groups has (VRC) then it is CAT($0$). We also show that tubular groups with (VRC) are virtually free-by-cyclic and virtually special.</description>

      <title>On the invariants of finite groups arising in a topological quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Group pairs, coherence and Farrell--Jones Conjecture for $K_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group pair $(G, X)$ consists of a group $G$ together with a $G$-set $X$. Such a pair encodes properties of $G$ relative to the stabilisers of points in $X$. In this paper, we show how to combine properties of group pairs and their stabilisers to prove coherence results for $G$ and its group algebra, as well as to study the quotient of $G$ obtained by killing the stabilisers.
  In particular, we prove that a torsion-free one-relator product of locally indicable groups is coherent provided that both factor groups are coherent. Moreover, we show that the group algebra of such a group over a field of characteristic $0$ is coherent whenever the group algebras of the factors are coherent.
  As other consequences of our methods, we also show that extensions of coherent locally indicable hyperbolic groups by $\mathbb{Z}$ are coherent and that groups admitting a Cohen--Lyndon presentation satisfy the Farrell--Jones Conjecture for $K_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Classifying representations of finite classical groups of Lie type of dimension up to $\ell^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p&gt;2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses.</description>
