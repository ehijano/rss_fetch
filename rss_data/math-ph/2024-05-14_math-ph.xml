      <title>A note on hidden classes in spinor classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lounesto classification is a well-established scheme for categorizing spinors based on their physical content, which are determined by their associated bilinear forms. It consists of six disjoint classes encompassing the known spinors within the context of the standard model of high-energy physics. However, advancements in theories beyond the standard model have opened the door to potential new spinorial adjoint structures, leading to new unforeseen classess. These developments indicate the potential for extending the standard Lounesto classification. In this paper, we explore all possible subclasses that could extend the Lounesto scheme. We highlight the most relevant subclasses by imposing constraints to their corresponding dual structures, thus broadening our understanding of spinor and its applications in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Learning the local density of states of a bilayer moir\'e material in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work of three of the authors showed that the operator which maps the local density of states of a one-dimensional untwisted bilayer material to the local density of states of the same bilayer material at non-zero twist, known as the twist operator, can be learned by a neural network. In this work, we first provide a mathematical formulation of that work, making the relevant models and operator learning problem precise. We then prove that the operator learning problem is well-posed for a family of one-dimensional models. To do this, we first prove existence and regularity of the twist operator by solving an inverse problem. We then invoke the universal approximation theorem for operators to prove existence of a neural network capable of approximating the twist operator.</description>

      <title>New Procedure for Evaluation of U(3) Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple method to calculate Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(3) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. While the canonical U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that respects U(3) symmetry, the U(3)-&gt;SO(3) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies. This new procedure precludes the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sums which were used in the 1973 formulation of Draayer and Akiyama, and hence provides faster and more accurate output of requested results. The resolution of the outer multiplicity is based on the null space concept of the U(3) generators proposed by Arne Alex et al., whereas the inner multiplicity in the angular momentum subgroup chain is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SO(3) raising operator. A C++ library built on this new methodology will be published in a complementary journal that specializes in the management and distribution of such programs.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between n-state spin and vertex models on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a correspondence among spin and vertex models with the same number of local states on the square lattice with toroidal boundary conditions. We argue that the partition functions of an arbitrary $n$-state spin model and of a certain specific $n$-state vertex model coincide for finite lattice sizes. The equivalent vertex model has $n^3$ non-null Boltzmann weights and their relationship with the edge weights of the spin model is explicitly presented. In particular, the Ising model in a magnetic field is mapped to an eight-vertex model whose weights configurations combine both even and odd number of incoming and outcoming arrows at a vertex. We have studied the Yang-Baxter algebra for such mixed eight-vertex model when the weights are invariant under arrows reversing. We find that while the Lax operator lie on the same elliptic curve of the even eight-vertex model the respective $\mathrm{R}$-matrix can not be presented in terms of the difference of two rapidities. We also argue that the spin-vertex equivalence may be used to imbed an integrable spin model in the realm of the quantum inverse scattering framework. As an example, we show how to determine the $\mathrm{R}$-matrix of the 27-vertex model equivalent to a three-state spin model devised by Fateev and Zamolodchikov.</description>

      <title>Non-unique Hamiltonians for Discrete Symplectic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>The fermionic massless modular Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit expression for the modular hamiltonian of the von Neumann algebras associated to the unit double cone for the (fermionic) quantum field theories of the 2-component Weyl (helicity 1/2) field, and of the 4-component massless Dirac and Majorana fields. To this end, we represent the one particle spaces of these theories in terms of solutions of the corresponding wave equations, and obtain the action of the modular group on them. As an application, we compute the relative entropy between the vacuum of the massless Majorana field and one particle states associated to waves with Cauchy data localized in the spatial unit ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prelle-Singer method allows determining an elementary first integral admitted by a polynomial vector field in the plane. It is a semi-algorithm whose nonlinear step consists of determining the Darboux polynomials of the vector field. In this article we construct a linear procedure to determine the Darboux polynomials present in the integrating factor of a polynomial vector field in the plane. Next, we extend the procedure to deal with rational 2ODEs that admit an elementary first integral</description>

      <title>Complex Analytic Structure of Stationary Flows of an Ideal Incompressible Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the structure of an analytic Banach manifold in the set of stationary flows without stagnation points of the ideal incompressible fluid in a periodic 2-d channel bounded by the curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ where $f, g$ are periodic analytic functions. The work is based on the recent discovery (Serfati, Shnirelman, Frisch, and others) that for the stationary flows the level lines of the stream function (and hence the flow lines) are real-analytic curves. The set of such functions is not a linear subspace of any reasonable function space. However, we are able to introduce in this set a structure of a real-analytic Banach manifold if we regard its elements as collections of level lines parametrized by the function value. If $\psi(x,y)$ is the stream function, then the flow line has equation $y=a(x,\psi)$ where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a "partially analytic" function. This means that this function is analytic in the first argument while it has a finite regularity in the second one. We define the spaces of analytic functions on the line, analogous to the Hardy space, and the spaces of partially analytic functions. The equation $\Delta\psi=F(\psi)$ is transformed into a quasilinear equation $\Phi(a)=F$ for the function $a(x,\psi)$. Using the Analytic Implicit Function Theorem in the complex Banach space, we are able to prove that for the functions $f(x), g(x)$ close to constant the solution $a(x,\psi; F, f, g)$ exists and depends analytically on parameters $F, f, g$.</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two generic conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures which admits a density. Relating the convolution to the quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and using recent results describing those coefficients, we give a manifestly positive formula for this density. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive formula for the volume of moduli spaces of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <title>Spectral parameter power series representation for regular solutions of the radial Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral parameter power series (SPPS) representation for the regular solution of the radial Dirac system with complex coefficients is obtained, as well as a SPPS representation for the (entire) characteristic function of the corresponding spectral problem on a finite interval. Based on the SPPS representation, a numerical method for solving spectral problems is developed. It is shown that the method is also applicable to solving spectral problems for perturbed Bessel equations. We exhibit that the proposed numerical method delivers excellent results. Additionally, an application of the method to find the energy values of hydrogen-like atoms with a finite radius is presented.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

Utilizing the expression of the generalized complex structure on the metric Lie group manifold $G$ in terms of operator relations on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we formulate a Yang-Baxter sigma model with a generalized complex structure. Additionally, we present multi-Yang-Baxter sigma models featuring two and three compatible Nijenhuis structures. Examples for each of these models are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 2000s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and the $G$-birational invariants introduced by Kontsevich, Pestun, and Tschinkel in recent pioneering work, along with presenting applications. The final section of this paper explores conjectures and preliminary results regarding gerbes, connections over orbifolds, discrete torsion, and potential approaches via motivic integration and twisted K-theory for $G$-birationality. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

Abstract: Vortices produce locally concentrated field configurations and are solutions to the nonlinear partial differential equations systems of complicated structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness for solutions of the gauged non-Abelian vortices in a coupled 4D-2D quantum field theory by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ using the calculus of variations. In addition, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>

Abstract: This work considers the inverse dynamic source problem arising from the time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). We recover the dynamic distributions of fluorophores in biological tissue by the one single boundary measurement in finite time domain. We build the uniqueness theorem of this inverse problem. After that, we introduce a weighted norm and establish the conditional stability of Lipschitz type for the inverse problem by this weighted norm. The numerical inversions are considered under the framework of the deep neural networks (DNNs). We establish the generalization error estimates rigorously derived from Lipschitz conditional stability of inverse problem. Finally, we propose the reconstruction algorithms and give several numerical examples illustrating the performance of the proposed inversion schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest eigenvalue of random tensors is an important feature of systems involving disorder, equivalent to the ground state energy of glassy systems or to the injective norm of quantum states. For symmetric Gaussian random tensors of order $3$ and of size $N$, in the presence of a Gaussian noise, continuing the work [arXiv:2310.14589], we compare the edge of the genuine eigenvalue distribution with that of the signed distribution, using field theoretic methods at large $N$ combined with earlier rigorous results of [arXiv:1003.1129]. We support our claims with Monte Carlo simulations. We find two critical points as the variance of the noise increases, the first of which corresponding to the emergence of an outlier from the main part of the spectrum and the second where this outlier merges with the corresponding trivial eigenvalue and they both become complex.</description>

      <title>LLM4ED: Large Language Models for Automatic Equation Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>Widom's conjecture: variance asymptotics and entropy bounds for counting statistics of free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a central limit theorem for bulk counting statistics of free fermions in smooth domains of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with an explicit description of the covariance structure. This amounts to a study of the asymptotics of norms of commutators between spectral projectors of semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators and indicator functions supported in the bulk. In the spirit of the Widom conjecture, we show that the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of these commutators is of order $\hbar^{-n+1}\log(\hbar)$ as the semiclassical parameter $\hbar$ tends to $0$. We also give a new upper bound on the trace norm of these commutators and applications to estimations of the entanglement entropy for free fermions.</description>

      <title>Sharp localization on the first supercritical stratum for Liouville frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Anderson localization for Schr\"odinger operators with even analytic potentials on the first supercritical stratum for Liouville frequencies in the sharp regime $\{E: L(\omega,E)&gt;\beta(\omega)&gt;0, \kappa(\omega,E)=1\}$, with $\kappa(\omega,E)$ being Avila's acceleration. This paper builds on the large deviation measure estimate and complexity bound scheme, originally developed for Diophantine frequencies by Bourgain, Goldstein and Schlag \cites{BG,BGS1,BGS2}, and the improved complexity bounds in \cite{HS1}. Additionally, it strengthens the large deviation estimates for weak Liouville frequencies in \cite{HZ}. We also introduce new ideas to handle Liouville frequencies in a sharp way.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Toda flow is a well-known integrable Hamiltonian system that diagonalizes matrices. By keeping track of the distribution of entries and precise scattering asymptotics, one can exhibit matrix models for log-gases on the real line. These types of scattering asymptotics date back to fundamental work of Moser.
  More precisely, using the classical Toda flow acting on symmetric real tridiagonal matrices, we give a "symplectic" proof of the fact that the Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal model has a spectrum following the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Random Finite Noncommutative Geometries and Topological Recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.09362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a model for quantum gravity on finite noncommutative spaces using the theory of blobbed topological recursion. The model is based on a particular class of random finite real spectral triples ${(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D , \gamma , J) \,}$, called random matrix geometries of type ${(1,0) \,}$, with a fixed fermion space ${(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, \gamma , J) \,}$, and a distribution of the form ${e^{- \mathcal{S} (D)} {\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}} D}$ over the moduli space of Dirac operators. The action functional ${\mathcal{S} (D)}$ is considered to be a sum of terms of the form ${\prod_{i=1}^s \mathrm{Tr} \left( {D^{n_i}} \right)}$ for arbitrary ${s \geqslant 1 \,}$. The Schwinger-Dyson equations satisfied by the connected correlators ${W_n}$ of the corresponding multi-trace formal 1-Hermitian matrix model are derived by a differential geometric approach. It is shown that the coefficients ${W_{g,n}}$ of the large $N$ expansion of ${W_n}$'s enumerate discrete surfaces, called stuffed maps, whose building blocks are of particular topologies. The spectral curve ${\left( {\Sigma , \omega_{0,1} , \omega_{0,2}} \right)}$ of the model is investigated in detail. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the fundamental symmetric bidifferential ${\omega_{0,2}}$ in terms of the formal parameters of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid system is a system whose dynamics is given by a mixture of both continuous and discrete transitions. In particular, these systems can be utilised to describe the dynamics of a mechanical system with impacts. Based on the approach by Clark, we develop a geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory for forced and nonholonomic hybrid dynamical systems. We state the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equations for these classes of systems and apply our results to analyze some examples.</description>

Abstract: We show that for families of 1d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the cohomology class of the higher Berry curvature can be refined to an integral degree-3 class on the parameter space. Similarly, for families of U(1)-invariant 2d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the higher Thouless pump can be refined to an integral degree-2 class on the parameter space. We show that the 2d Thouless pump can be identified with an excess Berry curvature of a flux insertion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional 3-body Wolfes model with 2- and 3-body interactions also known as $G_2/I_6$-rational integrable model of the Hamiltonian reduction is exactly-solvable and superintegrable. Its Hamiltonian $H$ and two integrals ${\cal I}_{1}, {\cal I}_{2}$, which can be written as algebraic differential operators in two variables (with polynomial coefficients) of the 2nd and 6th orders, respectively, are represented as non-linear combinations of $g^{(2)}$ or $g^{(3)}$ (hidden) algebra generators in a minimal manner. By using a specially designed MAPLE-18 code to deal with algebraic operators it is found that $(H, {\cal I}_1, {\cal I}_2, {\cal I}_{12} \equiv [{\cal I}_1, {\cal I}_2])$ are the four generating elements of the {\it quartic} polynomial algebra of integrals. This algebra is embedded into the universal enveloping algebra $g^{(3)}$. In turn, 3-body/$A_2$-rational Calogero model is characterized by cubic polynomial algebra of integrals, it is mentioned briefly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the problem of the energy spectrum of a quantum vortex loop moving in a thin long pipe is solved for the first time. The vortex filament is described in the Local Induction Approximation. We quantize this dynamic system using a new method, which leads to non-trivial results for circulation $\Gamma$ and energy values $E$. In the final form, we present the spectrum of the vortex loop in the form of a ''Regge trajectory'' $E = E(\Gamma)$. The vortex quantization problem is considered outside of two-fluid hydrodynamics and other conventional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hbar$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to time-dependent and time-periodic linear response in Markov jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02982v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Markov jump process on a general state space to which we apply a time-dependent weak perturbation over a finite time interval. By martingale-based stochastic calculus, under a suitable exponential moment bound for the perturbation we show that the perturbed process does not explode almost surely and we study the linear response (LR) of observables and additive functionals. When the unperturbed process is stationary, the above LR formulas become computable in terms of the steady state two-time correlation function and of the stationary distribution. Applications are discussed for birth and death processes, random walks in a confining potential, random walks in a random conductance field. We then move to a Markov jump process on a finite state space and investigate the LR of observables and additive functionals in the oscillatory steady state (hence, over an infinite time horizon), when the perturbation is time-periodic. As an application we provide a formula for the complex mobility matrix of a random walk on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus, with possibly heterogeneous jump rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum dichotomies and coherent thermodynamics beyond first-order asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of exact and approximate transformation of quantum dichotomies in the asymptotic regime, i.e., the existence of a quantum channel $\mathcal E$ mapping $\rho_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\rho_2^{\otimes R_nn}$ with an error $\epsilon_n$ (measured by trace distance) and $\sigma_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\sigma_2^{\otimes R_n n}$ exactly, for a large number $n$. We derive second-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal transformation rate $R_n$ in the small, moderate, and large deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error regime, for an arbitrary pair $(\rho_1,\sigma_1)$ of initial states and a commuting pair $(\rho_2,\sigma_2)$ of final states. We also prove that for $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ given by thermal Gibbs states, the derived optimal transformation rates in the first three regimes can be attained by thermal operations. This allows us, for the first time, to study the second-order asymptotics of thermodynamic state interconversion with fully general initial states that may have coherence between different energy eigenspaces. Thus, we discuss the optimal performance of thermodynamic protocols with coherent inputs and describe three novel resonance phenomena allowing one to significantly reduce transformation errors induced by finite-size effects. What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Dirac equations in static spherically-symmetric space-times, and we present a type of spinor field whose structure allows the separation of elevation angle and radial coordinate in very general situations. We demonstrate that after such a separation of variables the Dirac equations reduce to two equations that can always be integrated, at least in principle. To prove that ours is a fully-working method, we find an explicit exact solution in the special case of the de Sitter universe.</description>

Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in quantum sciences, a quantum master equation that accurately and simply characterizes open quantum dynamics across extremely long timescales and in dispersive environments is still needed. In this study, we optimize the computation of the fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation to meet this need. Early versions of this master equation required computing a multidimensional integral, limiting its use. Our master equation accounts for simultaneous relaxation and dephasing, resulting in coefficients proportional to the system's spectral density over frequency derivative. In sub-Ohmic environments, this derivative induces infrared divergence in the master equation, invalidating the second-order Bloch-Redfield master equation findings. We analyze the approach to a ground state in a generic open quantum system and demonstrate that it is not reliably computed by the Bloch-Redfield equation alone. The optimized fourth-order equation shows that the ground-state approach is accurate to second order in bath coupling regardless of the dispersion, even though it can diverge in the fourth order at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Generalization of conformal Hamada operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The six-derivative conformal scalar operator was originally found by Hamada in its critical dimension of spacetime, $d=6$. We generalize this construction to arbitrary dimensions $d$ by adding new terms cubic in gravitational curvatures and by changing its coefficients of expansion in various curvature terms. The consequences of global scale-invariance and of infinitesimal local conformal transformations are derived for the form of this generalized operator. The system of linear equations for coefficients is solved giving explicitly the conformal Hamada operator in any $d$. Some singularities in construction for dimensions $d=2$ and $d=4$ are noticed. We also prove a general theorem that a scalar conformal operator with $n$ derivatives in $d=n-2$ dimensions is impossible to construct. Finally, we compare our explicit construction with the one that uses conformal covariant derivatives and conformal curvature tensors. We present new results for operators built with different orders of conformal covariant derivatives.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <title>Anomaly and invertible field theory with higher-form symmetry: Extended group cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. We explore the alternative algebraic approach based on cochains that directly characterize the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the anomalous phase factor of topological operator rearrangements. In the current literature, the algebraic approach has been systematically described for only finite 0-form symmetries. In this initial work, we generalize it to finite higher-form symmetries with trivial higher-group structure. We carefully analyze the algebraic cochains and abstract a purely algebraic structure that naturally generalizes group cohomology. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we show its isomorphism to the cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinants and "anomalous contributions'' in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics allow simple explicit representations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate ``anomalous contributions'' in the re-scaled correlators.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of current for the symmetric simple exclusion process on a semi-infinite line and on an infinite line with a slow bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the most influential exact results in classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are about current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundary, and in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. This result is obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach of macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. Our exact result enables us to address the corresponding problem on an infinite line in the presence of a slow bond and several related problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization Without Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantization map in geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds via the Poisson sigma model. This gives a polarization-free (path integral) definition of quantization which pieces together most known quantization schemes. We explain how this allows Schur's lemma to address the invariance of polarization problem. We compute this quantization map for the torus and obtain the noncommutative torus and its standard irreducible representation.</description>
