      <title>Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning (${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend to callable assets the model risk approach of B{\'e}n{\'e}zet and Cr{\'e}pey (2024), itself leveraging on the notion of hedging valuation adjustment initially introduced for dealing with transaction costs in Burnett (2021) \&amp;amp; Burnett and Williams (2021). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We showthat a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Spectral Risk Measure for Left Truncated and Right Censored Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Left truncated and right censored data are encountered frequently in insurance loss data due to deductibles and policy limits. Risk estimation is an important task in insurance as it is a necessary step for determining premiums under various policy terms. Spectral risk measures are inherently coherent and have the benefit of connecting the risk measure to the user's risk aversion. In this paper we study the estimation of spectral risk measure based on left truncated and right censored data. We propose a non parametric estimator of spectral risk measure using the product limit estimator and establish the asymptotic normality for our proposed estimator. We also develop an Edgeworth expansion of our proposed estimator. The bootstrap is employed to approximate the distribution of our proposed estimator and shown to be second order accurate. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to compare the proposed spectral risk measure estimator with the existing parametric and nonparametric estimators for left truncated and right censored data. Our observation reveal that the proposed estimator outperforms all the estimators for small values of $k$ (coefficient of absolute risk aversion) and for small sample sizes for i.i.d. case. In the dependent case, it demonstrates superior performance for small $k$ across all sample sizes. Finally, we estimate the exponential spectral risk measure for two data sets viz; the Norwegian fire claims and the French marine losses.</description>
