      <title>Interband and intraband transitions, as well as charge mobility in driven two-band model with electron phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interband and intraband transitions are fundamental concepts in the study of electronic properties of materials, particularly semiconductors and nanomaterials. These transitions involve the movement of electrons between distinct energy states or bands within a material. Besides, charge mobility is also a critical parameter in materials science and electronics. A thorough understanding of these transitions and mobility is critical for the development and optimization of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we investigate the influence of external periodic drivings on interband and intraband transitions, as well as charge mobility, within a driven two-band model that includes electron-phonon coupling. These external periodic drivings can include a periodic laser field, a time-varying magnetic or electric field, or an alternating current (AC) voltage source. We have developed the Floquet surface hopping (FSH) and Floquet mean field (FMF) methods to simulate electronic dynamics under various drivings in both real and reciprocal spaces. Our findings demonstrate that periodic drivings can enhance interband transitions while suppressing intraband transitions. Additionally, charge mobility is restrained by these external periodic drivings in the driven two-band model.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of superlattice and anomalous miniband topology from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional materials subject to long-wavelength modulations have emerged as novel platforms to study topological and correlated quantum phases. In this article, we develop a versatile and computationally inexpensive method to predict the topological properties of materials subjected to a superlattice potential by combining degenerate perturbation theory with the method of symmetry indicators. In the absence of electronic interactions, our analysis provides a systematic rule to find the Chern number of the superlattice-induced miniband starting from the harmonics of the applied potential and a few material-specific coefficients. Our method also applies to anomalous (interaction-generated) bands, for which we derive an efficient algorithm to determine all Chern numbers compatible with a self-consistent solution to the Hartree-Fock equations. Our approach gives a microscopic understanding of the quantum anomalous Hall insulators recently observed in rhombohedral graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric in Step Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions has gained considerable interest with the discovery of moir\'e materials that exhibit bands flattened by quantum interference. The quantum metric, the symmetric part of the quantum geometric tensor, influences several observables, such as the dielectric constant, superfluid stiffness and optical spectral weight. However, a direct measurement of the metric itself has remained elusive so far. In linear response functions such as the conductivity, the matrix elements of the metric typically appear convoluted with energy prefactors, preventing finding an observable that is directly proportional to the total quantum metric. The only observable that may extract it is the integrated optical spectral weight weighted by the inverse frequency, a generalized sum rule known as the Souza-Wilkens-Martin (SWM) sum rule. However, the sum rule comes with experimental challenges, such as requiring a large spectrum of frequency resolution. In this work, we propose relaxation from constrained equilibrium as a method to directly measure the symmetric part of the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor (tQGT), which at $t=0$ is the quantum metric. Additionally, we comment on other geometric properties of insulators that are absent in the frequency expansions of conductivity in insulators but can, in principle, be revealed in step response.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states of massless fermion with non-quantized and zero Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk-boundary correspondence for massless Dirac fermion in $\alpha$-${T}_3$ lattice where the Berry phase can be continuously tuned from $\pi $ (graphene) to $0$ ($T_3$ or dice lattice) without modifying the energy dispersion. The topological origin of edge states is revealed by unitary transform of the Hamiltonian, which maps $\alpha$-${T}_3$ zigzag ribbon (ZR) into stub Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. In the Majorana representation of the eigenstates, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is manifested by azimuthal winding numbers on the Bloch sphere. Particularly, $T_3$ ZR exemplifies a topologically nontrivial system with zero Berry phase. Contrary to the conventional topological insulators, band gap closing in the corresponding stub SSH chain is not accompanied by a topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>Majorana representation for topological edge states of massless Dirac fermion with non-quantized Berry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bulk-boundary correspondences for zigzag ribbons (ZRs) of massless Dirac fermion in two-dimensional $\alpha$-${T}_3$ lattice. By tuning the hopping parameter $\alpha\in[0,1]$, the $\alpha$-${T}_3$ lattice interpolates between pseudospin $S=1/2$ (graphene) and $S=1$ (${T}_3$ or dice lattice), for $\alpha=0$ and $1$, respectively, which is followed by continuous change of the Berry phase from $\pi$ to $0$. The range of existence for edge states in the momentum space is determined by solving tight-binding equations at the boundaries of the ZRs. We find that the transitions of in-gap bands from bulk to edge states in the momentum space do not only occur at the positions of the Dirac cones but also at additional points depending on $\alpha\notin \{0,1\}$. The $\alpha$-${T}_3$ ZRs are mapped into stub Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains by performing unitary transforms of the bulk Hamiltonian. The non-trivial topology of the bulk bands is revealed by the Majorana representation of the eigenstates, where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant is manifested by the winding numbers on the complex plane and the Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic polarization sensing of electrostatic superlattice potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmon polaritons are formed by coupling light with delocalized electrons. The half-light and half-matter nature of plasmon polaritons endows them with unparalleled tunability via a range of parameters, such as dielectric environments and carrier density. Therefore, plasmon polaritons are expected to be tuned when in proximity to polar materials since the carrier density is tuned by an electrostatic potential; conversely, the plasmon polariton response might enable the sensing of polarization. Here, we use infrared nano-imaging and nano-photocurrent measurements to investigate heterostructures composed of graphene and twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-BN), with alternating polarization in a triangular network of moir\'e stacking domains. We observe that the carrier density and the corresponding plasmonic response of graphene are modulated by polar domains in t-BN. In addition, we demonstrate that the nanometer-wide domain walls of graphene moir\'es superlattices, created by the polar domains of t-BN, provide momenta to assist the plasmonic excitations. Furthermore, our studies establish that the plasmon of graphene could function as a delicate sensor for polarization textures. The evolution of polarization textures in t-BN under uniform electric fields is tomographically examined via plasmonic imaging. Strikingly, no noticeable polarization switching is observed under applied electric fields up to 0.23 V/nm, at variance with transport reports. Our nano-images unambiguously reveal that t-BN with triangular domains acts like a ferrielectric, rather than ferroelectric claimed by many previous studies.</description>

      <title>Capacitance-based Fermion parity read-out and predicted Rabi oscillations in a Majorana nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast (10 GHz) mid-IR modulator based on ultra-fast electrical switching of the light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a free-space amplitude modulator for mid-infrared radiation (lambda=9.6 um) that operates at room temperature up to at least 20 GHz (above the -3dB cutoff frequency measured at 8.2 GHz). The device relies on the ultra-fast transition between weak and strong-coupling regimes induced by the variation of the applied bias voltage. Such transition induces a modulation of the device reflectivity. It is made of a semiconductor heterostructure enclosed in a judiciously designed array of metal-metal optical resonators, that - all-together - behave as an electrically tunable surface. At negative bias, it operates in the weak light-matter coupling regime. Upon application of an appropriate positive bias, the quantum wells populate with electrons and the device transitions to the strong-coupling regime. The modulator transmission keeps linear with input RF power in the 0dBm - 9dBm range. The increase of optical powers up to 25 mW exhibit a weak beginning saturation a little bit below.</description>

      <title>Towards full instanton trans-series in Hofstadter's butterfly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Dynamics and Destabilization of Shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers under UV and Blue Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer unique opportunities for studying photochemical reactions at the single-molecule level, such as the photogeneration of radical pairs in proximal molecules. A prerequesite for such experimental schemes is the detailed understanding of the charge and spin dynamics of NV centers exposed to the short-wavelength light required for photoexciting chemical species. Here, we measure and analyze the charge and spin dynamics of shallow NV centers under 445 nm (blue) and 375 nm (UV) illumination. With blue excitation, we observe a power-dependent charge-state preparation accompanied by modest preservation of spin initialization fidelity. Under UV excitation, we find a power-independent charge-state preparation and no spin polarization. We further observe an irreversible aging of NV centers under prolonged exposure to UV, and to a lesser extent, blue laser excitation, which we attribute to formation of new electronic trap states. This aging manifests itself in a reduced charge stability and spin contrast, and is detrimental to the NV sensing performance. We evaluate the prospects and limitations of NV centers for probing photogenerated radical pairs based on experimentally measured sensitivities following blue and UV excitation, and outline the design rules for possible sensing schemes.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from domain wall fluctuations in sliding ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayers of two-dimensional van der Waals materials that lack an inversion centre can show a novel form of ferroelectricity, where certain stacking arrangements of the two layers lead to an interlayer polarization. Under an external out-of-plane electric field, a relative sliding between the two layers can occur accompanied by an inter-layer charge transfer and a ferroelectric switching. We show that the domain walls that mediate ferroelectric switching are a locus of strong attractive interactions between electrons. The attraction is mediated by the ferroelectric domain wall fluctuations, effectively driven by the soft interlayer shear phonon. We comment on the possible relevance of this attraction mechanism to the recent observation of an interplay between sliding ferroelectricity and superconductivity in bilayer $\text{T$_d$-MoTe}_2$. We also discuss the possible role of this mechanism in the superconductivity of moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <title>Multi-species optically addressable spin defects in a van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin defects hosted in two-dimensional van der Waals materials represent a new frontier for quantum technologies, promising to lead to a new class of ultrathin quantum sensors and simulators. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host several types of optically addressable spin defects, thus offering a unique opportunity to simultaneously address and utilise various spin species in a single material. Here we demonstrate an interplay between two separate spin species within a single hBN crystal, namely $S=1$ boron vacancy defects and visible emitter spins. We unambiguously prove that the visible emitters are $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spins and further demonstrate room temperature coherent control and optical readout of both spin species. Importantly, by tuning the two spin species into resonance with each other, we observe cross-relaxation indicating strong inter-species dipolar coupling. We then demonstrate magnetic imaging using the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ defects, both under ambient and cryogenic conditions, and leverage their lack of intrinsic quantization axis to determine the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of a test sample. Our results establish hBN as a versatile platform for quantum technologies in a van der Waals host at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Charge pumping with strong spin-orbit coupling: Fermi surface breathing, Berry curvature, and higher harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin and charge pumping induced by a precessing magnetization has been instrumental to the development of spintronics. Nonetheless, most theoretical studies so far treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, which disregards the competition between exchange and spin-orbit fields. In this work, based on Keldysh formalism and Wigner expansion, we develop an adiabatic theory of spin and charge pumping adapted to systems with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling. We apply this theory to the magnetic Rashba gas and magnetic graphene cases and discuss the pumped ac and dc current. We show that the pumped current possesses both intrinsic (Berry curvature-driven) and extrinsic (Fermi surface breathing-driven) contributions, akin to magnetic damping. In addition, we find that higher harmonics can be generated under large-angle precession and we propose a couple of experimental setups where such an effect can be experimentally observed.</description>

Abstract: The inherent complexity of system-bath interactions often requires making critical approximations, which we here show to have a radical influence on the renormalization group flow and the resulting phase diagram. Specifically, for the Caldeira-Leggett model Schmid and Bulgadaev (SB) predicted a phase transition, whose experimental verification in resistive superconducting circuits is currently hotly debated. For normal metal and Josephson junction array resistors, we show that the mapping to Caldeira-Leggett is only exact when artificially decompactifying the superconducting phase. Retaining phase compactness immediately leads to a phase diagram depending on four instead of two parameters. While we still find an SB-like transition in the transmon regime, the critical parameter is controlled exclusively by the capacitive coupling. In contrast, the Cooper pair box maps to the anisotropic Kondo model, where a pseudo-ferromagnetic phase is not allowed for regular electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain influenced by atomic charges in water model using orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations</title>

Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by simple lattice theory and molecular dynamic simulations. It has been pointed out that atomic charges in water model is an important issue, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we performed orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported from literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the x-axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge value, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings shed light on the vital role of atomic charges in water models and also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>
