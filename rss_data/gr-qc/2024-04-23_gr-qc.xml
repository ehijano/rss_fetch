      <title>Gaussian Process Approach for Model-Independent Reconstruction of $f(Q)$ Gravity with Direct Hubble Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian $f(Q)$ motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process (GP), which allows us to eliminate this issue in a $f(Q)$ model-independent way. In particular, we use the 57 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to reconstruct $H(z)$ and its derivatives $H'(z)$, $H''(z)$, which resulting lead us to reconstruct region of $f(Q)$, without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along $\Lambda$CDM constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new $f(Q)$ parametrization, i.e., $f(Q)= -2\Lambda+ \epsilon Q^2$, with the single parameter $\epsilon$, which signifies the deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential $f(Q)$ models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed $f(Q)$ function, allow the $H_0$ tension to be alleviated.</description>

      <title>Geodesically complete universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularity theorems demonstrate the inevitable breakdown of the concept of continuous, classical spacetime under highly general conditions. Quantum gravity is expected to intervene to avoid singularities and models so far hint towards several regularized geometries, in which limited spacetime regions requiring full quantum gravitational description can be safely covered by an extension of some suitable spacetime geometry. Motivated by these premises, in recent years, a systematic, quantum gravity agnostic, study has been carried out to catalogue all the conceivable non-singular, continuous, and globally hyperbolic geometries arising from evading Penrose's focusing theorem in gravitational collapse. In this study, we extend this inquiry by systematically examining all potential non-singular, continuous, and globally hyperbolic extensions into the past of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metrics. As in the black hole case, our investigation reveals a remarkably limited set of alternative scenarios. The stringent requisites of homogeneity and isotropy drastically restrict the viable singularity-free geometries to merely three discernible non-singular cosmological spacetimes: a bouncing universe (where the scale factor reaches a minimum in the past before re-expanding), an emergent universe (where the scale factor reaches and maintains a constant value in the past), and an asymptotically emergent universe (where the scale factor diminishes continually, asymptotically approaching a constant value in the past). We also discuss the implications of these findings for the initial conditions of our universe, and the arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves in gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new set of four-geometries exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves. These are found as explicit solutions to 5D vacuum Hilbert-Palatini theory, where the fifth dimen sion has vanishing proper length. In the emergent 4D dynamics, governed by the condition that the Ricci scalar must vanish (upto a cosmological constant), these correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. The enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo is obtained, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is predicted to be $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is different from the result for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>

      <title>Adaptive algorithms for low-latency cancellation of seismic Newtonian-noise at the Virgo gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system was recently implemented in the Virgo detector to cancel noise in its data produced by seismic waves directly coupling with the suspended test masses through gravitational interaction. The data from seismometers are being filtered to produce a coherent estimate of the associated gravitational noise also known as Newtonian noise. The first implementation of the system uses a time-invariant (static) Wiener filter, which is the optimal filter for Newtonian-noise cancellation assuming that the noise is stationary. However, time variations in the form of transients and slow changes in correlations between sensors are possible and while time-variant filters are expected to cope with these variations better than a static Wiener filter, the question is what the limitations are of time-variant noise cancellation. In this study, we present a framework to study the performance limitations of time-variant noise cancellation filters and carry out a proof-of-concept with adaptive filters on seismic data at the Virgo site. We demonstrate that the adaptive filters, at least those with superior architecture, indeed significantly outperform the static Wiener filter with the residual noise remaining above the statistical error bound.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of Time-periodic Solutions of the Dirac Equation in Kerr-Newman-(A)dS Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonexistence of nontrivial time-periodic solutions of the Dirac equation in Kerr-Newman-(A)dS spacetime. In the non-extreme Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime, we prove that there is no nontrivial $L^p$ integrable Dirac particle for arbitrary $(\lambda,p)\in \mathbb{R}\times[2,+\infty)$. In the extreme Kerr-Newman-dS and extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, we show the equation relations between the energy eigenvalue $\omega$, the horizon radius, the angular momentum, the electric charge and the cosmological constant if there exists nontrivial $L^p$ integrable time-periodic solution of the Dirac equation, and further give the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>The initial value problem in cosmology: An alternative derivation for beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we address the puzzle related to the existence of a proper cosmological solution, where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknown functions. Although only two of the various dynamical equations are independent, the solution of those two equations must have to satisfy all the dynamical equations simultaneously at all instants. We show that this last requirement demands a constraint on the initial condition. When the initial constraint is satisfied, then and only then, one can have proper cosmological dynamics. The whole exercise turns out to be an alternative derivation of the initial value problem in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the late-time tails of the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late-time behaviour of the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation (which is a wave equation for the spin-zero component of the electromagnetic field strength tensor) on the closure of the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr spacetime is studied numerically. Within the Kerr family, the case of Schwarzschild background is also considered. Horizon-penetrating compactified hyperboloidal coordinates are used, which allow the behaviour of the solutions to be observed at the event horizon and at future null infinity as well. For the initial data, pure multipole configurations that have compact support and are either stationary or non-stationary are taken. It is found that with such initial data the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation converge at late times either to a known static solution (up to a constant factor) or to zero. As the limit is approached, the solutions exhibit a quasinormal ringdown and finally a power-law decay. The exponents characterizing the power-law decay of the spherical harmonic components of the field variable are extracted from the numerical data for various values of the parameters of the initial data, and based on the results a proposal for a Price's law relevant to the Fackerell-Ipser equation is made. Certain conserved energy and angular momentum currents are used to verify the numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical model. In the construction of these currents a discrete symmetry of the Fackerell-Ipser equation, which is the product of an equatorial reflection and a complex conjugation, is also taken into account.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Generalized Uncertainty Principle Effects on Hawking Radiation in Rotating Linear Dilaton Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on Hawking particle emission in a rotating linear dilaton black hole (RLDBH) spacetime is examined in this thesis. The concerned study presents a thermal emission model for black holes (BHs) that incorporates the influence of gravitational lens particles through GUP during the quantum tunneling process. The findings suggest that with GUP support, the temperature of Hawking radiation decreases as GUP parameters increase and rises with an increasing BH mass. The thesis also delves into the repercussions of these discoveries on the information loss paradox and adjusted entropy, while also exploring the potential utilization of astrophysical data to confirm GUP effects. In conclusion, our work underscores the significant role of GUP in the thermal emission of non-asymptotically flat (NAF), stationary BHs and its capacity to shed light on the intricate relationship between astrophysics and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Charged analog of anisotropic dark energy star in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark energy is one of the potential strategies for preventing compact objects from gravitationally collapsing into singularities. Because it is the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe, it has the greatest impact on the cosmos. Thus, it is plausible that dark energy will interact with any stellar object that is compact in the universe [\textit{Phys. Rev. D} \textbf{103}, 084042 (2021)]. Our main goal in this work is to create a simplified model, in the Rastall gravitational framework, of a charged strange star coupled to anisotropic dark energy in Krori-Barua spacetime [\textit{J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.} \textbf{8}:508, 1975]. Here, we consider a specific strange star object, Her X-1, with observed values of mass $=(0.85 \pm 0.15)M_{\odot}$ and radius $= 8.1_{-0.41}^{+0.41}$ km., so that we can develop our model. In this context, we began by modeling dark energy using the equation of state (EoS), in which the dark energy density is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter-energy density. The Darmois-Israel condition has been used to calculate the unknown constants that are present in the metric. We perform a detailed analysis of the model's physical properties, including the mass-radius relation, pressure, density, metric function, and dark energy parameters, by varying the Rastall coupling parameter. We also examine the stability and force equilibrium of our proposed stellar configuration. Following a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we discovered that our suggested model is both singularity-free and meets all stability requirements needed to be a stable, physically reasonable stellar model.</description>

      <title>Well behaved class of Heintzmann's solution within $f(R,\,T)$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to develop a well-behaved class of Heintzmann IIa [{\em H. Heintzmann, Z. Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)}] solution in the context of $f(R,\, T)$ gravity. In the $f(R, T)$ framework, the gravitational action includes both the Ricci scalar ($R$) and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor ($T$). We chose a particular $f(R,\,T)$ model s.t. $f(R,\,T) = R+2 \chi T$, where $\chi$ is known as the coupling parameter. This solution describes a novel isotropic compact fluid sphere with positively finite central pressure and density in this extended theory of gravity. The results obtained analytically are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of the coupling parameter $\chi$. The solution for a specific compact object, Vela X-1, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 9.56_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.77 \pm 0.08~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ [{\em M. L. Rawls et al. ApJ, 730, 25 (2011)}], is shown here. We analyze the fundamental physical attributes of the star, which reveals the influence of the coupling parameter $\chi$ on the values of substance parameters. This helps us to make a fruitful comparison of this modified $f(R,\, T)$ gravity with the standard GR and notice that it holds good for stable compact objects. In this framework, the star under our consideration exhibits a stable structure consistent with the Heintzmann IIa {\em ansatz}. From all of our obtained graphical and numerical results, we can ultimately conclude that our reported model is physically admissible and satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>

      <title>The Lambda-CDM-NG cosmological model: A possible resolution of the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is based on two insights: (1) that general relativity alone does not specify how much of the matter density contributes to the source term in Friedmann's equation, and how much contributes as the source of the gravitational potential of condensed objects; and (2) the source of the gravitational potential in the currently accepted cosmological model, for the small scales of condensed objects, is not what one would expect from Newtonian theory. Here insight (1) is used to restore the source of the gravitational potential to its Newtonian value, giving a new cosmological model. This model uses only conventional general relativity (no speculative physics) and the usual cosmological sources of gravitation, and there is no Hubble tension in this model if the total gravitational potential of condensed objects falls in a certain range. The deceleration parameter in the new model differs from that in the currently favored onel, suggesting a test to distinguish between the two models.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a $\textit{parsimonious}$ manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the $\gamma$ Eddington parameter, which reads $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\varTheta}$, where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This $\textit{non-perturbative}$ result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian $\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$ expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value $\gamma_{\,\text{GR}}=1$ as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case $\varTheta$ approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. $\omega&gt;-3/2$, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Special Issue on "Modified Gravity Approaches to the Tensions of $\Lambda$CDM"} in the Universe journal tackles significant challenges faced by the $\Lambda$CDM model, including discrepancies in the Hubble constant, growth rate of structures, and cosmological anisotropies. These issues suggest foundational cracks in the model, raising questions about the validity of General Relativity, dark energy, and cosmological principles at large scales. This collection brings together leading researchers to delve into Modified Gravity theories as potential solutions. Covering approaches from Scalar-Tensor theories to $f(R,T)$ gravity and beyond, each contribution presents innovative research aimed at addressing the limitations of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This Special Issue not only highlights the theoretical and empirical strengths of Modified Gravity models but also opens avenues for future investigations, emphasizing the synergy between theoretical advancements and observational evidence to deepen our cosmological understanding.</description>

      <title>Possible signatures of higher dimension in thin accretion disk around brane world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism and inspired by the rich analogies between electrodynamics and general relativity, we try one step further along this line and suggest a new counterpart in the gravitoelectromagnetic world analogue to the electromagnetic physics. A counterpart model of the MagnetoHydroDynamics that could help us to understand the possible new physics in tightly bounded spacetime-matter systems such as the case of extremely relativistic fluids in the early Universe. This new viewpoint also suggests a possible new form of spacetime-matter turbulence which may be tested through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for eccentricity in the population of binary black holes observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in eccentric orbits produce distinct modulations the emitted gravitational waves (GWs). The measurement of orbital eccentricity can provide robust evidence for dynamical binary formation channels. We analyze 57 GW events from the first, second and third observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration using a multipolar aligned-spin inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and relativistic anomaly. This is made computationally feasible with the machine-learning code DINGO which accelerates inference by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional inference. First, we find eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors of 1.84 to 4.75 (depending on the glitch mitigation) for GW200129, 3.0 for GW190701 and 1.77 for GW200208_22. We measure $e_{\text{gw}, 10Hz}$ to be $0.27_{-0.12}^{+0.10}$ to $0.17_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ for GW200129, $0.35_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$ for GW190701 and $0.35_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ for GW200208_22. Second, we find $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors between the eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular precessing-spin hypothesis between 1.43 and 4.92 for GW200129, 2.61 for GW190701 and 1.23 for GW200208_22. Third, our analysis does not show evidence for eccentricity in GW190521, which has an eccentric aligned-spin against quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of 0.04. Fourth, we estimate that if we neglect the spin-precession and use an astrophysical prior, the probability of one out of the 57 events being eccentric is greater than 99.5% or $(100 - 8.4 \times 10^{-4})$% (depending on the glitch mitigation). Fifth, we study the impact on parameter estimation when neglecting either eccentricity or higher modes in eccentric models. These results underscore the importance of including eccentric parameters in the characterization of BBHs for GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Regularized Conformal Electrodynamics: Novel C-metric in (2+1) Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal electrodynamics is a particularly interesting example of power Maxwell non-linear electrodynamics, designed to possess conformal symmetry in all dimensions. In this paper, we propose a regularized version of Conformal electrodynamics, minimally regularizing the field of a point charge at the origin by breaking the conformal invariance of the theory with a dimensionfull "Born-Infeld-like" parameter. In four dimensions the new theory reduces to the recently studied Regularized Maxwell electrodynamics, distinguished by its "Maxwell-like" solutions for accelerated and slowly rotating black hole spacetimes. Focusing on three dimensions, we show that the new theory shares many of the properties of its four-dimensional cousin, including the existence of the charged C-metric solution (currently unknown in the Maxwell theory).</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to measure the cosmological spatial curvature by employing the deviation from statistical isotropy due to the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect of large scale galaxy clustering. This approach has a higher degree of model independence than most other proposed methods, being independent of calibration of standard candles, rulers, or clocks, of the power spectrum shape (and thus also of the pre-recombination physics), of the galaxy bias, of the theory of gravity, of the dark energy model and of the background cosmology in general. We find that a combined DESI-Euclid galaxy survey can achieve $\Delta \Omega_{k0}=0.057$ at 1$\sigma$ C.L. in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ by combining power-spectrum and bispectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Penrose Inequality for Cohomogeneity One Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the spacetime Penrose inequality for asymptotically flat $2(n+1)$-dimensional initial data sets for the Einstein equations, which are invariant under a cohomogeneity one action of $\mathrm{SU}(n+1)$. Analogous results are obtained for asymptotically hyperbolic initial data that arise as spatial hypersurfaces in asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, it is shown that with the dominant energy condition, the total mass is bounded below by an explicit function of the outermost apparent horizon area. Furthermore, the inequality is saturated if and only if the initial data isometrically embed into a Schwarzschild(-AdS) spacetime. This generalizes the only previously known case of the conjectured spacetime Penrose inequality, established under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Additionally, in the time symmetric case, we observe that the inequality holds for $4(n+1)$-dimensional and 16-dimensional initial data invariant under cohomogeneity one actions of $\mathrm{Sp}(n+1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(9)$, respectively, thus treating the inequality for all cohomogeneity one actions in this regime.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Orbital Alignments of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the proposed space gravitational wave detector LISA, we will be able to measure the geometrical configurations of $\sim 10^4$ close white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. The obtained data will be an entirely new resource to examine the randomness of their orbital orientations. Partly motivated by a recent reported on the systematic alignments of bulge planetary nebulae, we discuss the outlook of the orientational analysis with LISA. We find that a quadrupole pattern as small as $\sim 0.05$ can be detected for bulge white dwarf binaries, owing to their large available number. From such a pattern analysis, we might geometrically explore fossil records in our Galaxy billions of years ago.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entanglement Capacity of de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant progress in the development of general relativistic codes for the numerical solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics in spacetimes with high and dynamical curvature. These codes are valuable tools to explore the large-scale plasma dynamics such as that takes place when two neutron stars collide or when matter accretes onto a supermassive black hole. This chapter is meant to provide a very brief but complete overview of the set of equations that are normally solved in modern numerical codes after they are cast into a conservative formulation within a 3+1 split of spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on "Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although measuring the deterministic waveform of a weak classical force is a well-studied problem, estimating a random waveform, such as the spectral density of a stochastic signal field, is much less well-understood despite it being a widespread task at the frontier of experimental physics. State-of-the-art precision sensors of random forces must account for the underlying quantum nature of the measurement, but the optimal quantum protocol for interrogating such linear sensors is not known. We derive the fundamental precision limit, the extended channel quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, and the optimal protocol that attains it. In the experimentally relevant regime where losses dominate, we prove that non-Gaussian state preparation and measurements are required for optimality. We discuss how this non-Gaussian protocol could improve searches for signatures of quantum gravity, stochastic gravitational waves, and axionic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

Abstract: We explore superoscillations within the context of classical and quantum field theories, presenting novel solutions to Klein-Gordon's, Dirac's, Maxwell's and Einstein's equations. In particular, we illustrate a procedure of second quantization of fields and how to construct a Fock space which encompasses Superoscillating states. Furthermore, we extend the application of superoscillations to quantum tunnelings, scatterings and mixings of particles, squeezed states and potential advancements in laser interferometry, which could open new avenues for experimental tests of Quantum Gravity effects. By delving into the relationship among superoscillations and phenomena such as Hawking radiation, the Black Hole (BH) information and the Firewall paradox, we propose an alternative mechanism for information transfer across the BH event horizon.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for producing Primordial Black Holes from Inflationary Models Beyond Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <title>Towards testing the general bounce cosmology with the CMB B-mode auto-bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that a three-point correlation function of tensor perturbations from a bounce model in general relativity with a minimally-coupled scalar field is highly suppressed, and the resultant three-point function of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarizations is too small to be detected by CMB experiments. On the other hand, bounce models in a more general class with a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and gravity can predict the three-point correlation function of the tensor perturbations without any suppression, the amplitude of which is allowed to be much larger than that in general relativity. In this paper, we evaluate the three-point function of the B-mode polarizations from the general bounce cosmology with the non-minimal coupling and show that a signal-to-noise ratio of the B-mode auto-bispectrum in the general class can reach unity for $\ell_{\rm max}\geq9$ and increase up to $5.39$ for $\ell_{\rm max}=100$ in the full-sky case. We also discuss the possibility to test the general class of bounce models by upcoming CMB experiments.</description>

Abstract: Here we continue studying the Wahlquist metric. We know that the wave equation written for a zero mass scalar particle in the background of this metric gives Heun type solutions. To be able to use the existing literature on Heun functions, we try to put our wave equation to the standard form for these functions. Then we calculate the reflection coefficient of a wave coming from infinity and scattered at the center using this formalism using two independent methods.</description>

Abstract: In the standard derivation of the Kerr-Schild double copy, the geodicity of the Kerr-Schild vector and the stationarity of the spacetime are presented as assumptions that are necessary for the single copy to satisfy Maxwell's equations. However, it is well known that the vacuum Einstein equations imply that the Kerr-Schild vector is geodesic and shear-free, and that the spacetime possesses a distinguished vector field that is simultaneously a Killing vector of the full spacetime and the flat background, but need not be timelike with respect to the background metric. We show that the gauge field obtained by contracting this distinguished Killing vector with the Kerr-Schild graviton solves the vacuum Maxwell equations, and that this definition of the Kerr-Schild double copy implies the Weyl double copy when the spacetime is Petrov type D. When the Killing vector is taken to be timelike with respect to the background metric, we recover the familiar Kerr-Schild double copy, but the prescription is well defined for any vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime and we present new examples where the Killing vector is null or spacelike. While most examples of physical interest are type D, vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes are generically of Petrov type II. We present a straightforward example of such a spacetime and study its double copy structure. Our results apply to real Lorentzian spacetimes as well as complex spacetimes and real spacetimes with Kleinian signature, and provide a simple correspondence between real and self-dual vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes. This correspondence allows us to study the double copy structure of a self-dual analog of the Kerr spacetime. We provide evidence that this spacetime may be diffeomorphic to the self-dual Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Inflation in simple one-loop effective potentials of perturbative quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inflation in scalar-tensor perturbative quantum gravity driven by a one-loop effective potential. We consider effective potentials generated by three models. The first model describes a single scalar field with a non-vanishing mass. The second model describes a massless scalar field with non-minimal coupling to the Einstein tensor. The third model generalises the Coleman-Weinberg model for the gravitational case. The first model can be consistent with the observational data for $N\sim 70$ e-foldings. The second model can be consistent with the observational data for $N \sim 40$ e-foldings. We did not find parameters that make the generalised Coleman-Weinberg model consistent with the observational data. We discuss the implications of these results and ways to improve them with other terms of effective action.</description>

Abstract: By assuming simultaneously the unitarity of the Hawking evaporation and the universality of Bekenstein entropy bound as well as the validity of cosmic censorship conjecture, we find that the black hole evaporation rate could evolve from the usual inverse square law in black hole mass into a constant evaporation rate near the end of the Hawking evaporation before quantum gravity could come into play, inferring a slightly longer lifetime for lighter black holes.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the closed form expression for the metric perturbation around de Sitter spacetime generated by a matter source below Hubble scale both in generalized harmonic gauge and in Bondi gauge up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion, including both parities (i.e. both mass and current quadrupoles). We demonstrate that such a source causes a displacement memory effect close to future infinity that originates, in the even-parity sector, from a $\Lambda$-BMS transition between the two non-radiative regions of future infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Gravastar "Simulated Horizon" from TOV Equation Initial Value Problem with Relativistic Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13380v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of ``dynamical gravastars'', constructed by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with relativistic matter, undergoing a phase transition at high pressure to a state with negative energy density, as allowed in quantum theory. Since generation of a horizon-like structure or ``simulated horizon'' occurs at a radius above where the phase transition occurs, it is solely a property of the TOV equation with relativistic matter, for appropriate small radius initial conditions. We survey the formation of a simulated horizon from this point of view. From the numerical solutions, we show that the metric exponent appearing in the TOV equation undergoes an arc tangent-like jump, leading to formation of the simulated horizon. Rescaling the problem to fixed initial radius, we plot the ``phase diagram'' in the initial pressure--initial mass plane, showing the range of parameters where a simulated horizon dynamically forms. Reformulating the TOV equations in rescaling-invariant form yields improved numerical results for the ``phase diagram'', and gives a simplified model consisting of a 2-dimensional autonomous system of first order differential equations, for further analytical study.</description>

Abstract: A quest for phenomenological footprints of quantum gravity is among the central scientific tasks in the rising era of gravitational wave astronomy. We study gravitational wave dynamics within the noncommutative geometry framework, based on a Drinfeld twist and newly proposed noncommutative Einstein equation, and obtain the leading quantum correction to Regge-Wheeler potential up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter. By calculating the quasinormal mode frequencies we show that the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole remains stable under axial gravitational perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The backreaction of quantum fields in their vacuum state results in equilibrium structures that surpass the Buchdahl compactness limit. Such backreaction is encapsulated in the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET). In previous works we presented analytic approximations to the RSET, obtained by dimensional reduction, available in spherical symmetry, and showed that the backreaction-generated solutions described ultracompact fluid spheres with a negative mass interior. Here, we derive a novel approximation to the RSET that does not rely on dimensional reduction, but rather on a reduction of the differential order. This approximation also leads to regular stars surpassing the Buchdahl limit. We conclude that this is a consequence of the negative energies associated with the Boulware vacuum which, for sufficiently compact fluid spheres, make the Misner-Sharp mass negative near the centre of spherical symmetry. Our analysis provides further cumulative evidence that quantum vacuum polarization is capable of producing new forms of stellar equilibrium with robust properties accross different analytical approximations to the RSET.</description>

      <title>Horizon-bound objects: Kerr-Vaidya solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of horizons in finite time according to distant observers results in a number of remarkable properties of the objects they bound. Subject to this requirement, spherically-symmetric black holes can only decrease in mass, while white holes can only expand. We provide a detailed analysis of the latter scenario, focussing on the energy-momentum tensor near the horizon and the experiences of various observers. Kerr-Vaidya metrics are the simplest dynamical axially-symmetric solutions, all of which violate the null energy condition and thus are not excluded by the criterion of finite formation time. Of the four classes of Kerr-Vaidya metrics, two correspond to the allowed spherically-symmetric solutions: evaporating black holes and expanding white holes. We demonstrate a consistent description of accreting black holes based on the ingoing Kerr-Vaidya metric with increasing mass, and show that the model can be extended to cases where the angular momentum to mass ratio varies. Their apparent horizon is shown to be weakly singular. Pathologies are also identified in the evaporating white hole geometry which reinforce controversies arising from the classical and quantum instabilities of their static counterparts. We also describe a generalization of the equivalence between Rindler and Schwarzschild horizons to Kerr-Vaidya black holes, and describe the relevant geometric constructions.</description>

Abstract: We apply the gradient expansion approximation to the light-cone gauge, obtaining a separate universe picture at non-linear order in perturbation theory within this framework. Thereafter, we use it to generalize the $\delta N$ formalism in terms of light-cone perturbations. As a consistency check, we demonstrate the conservation of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurface $\zeta$ at the completely non-linear level. The approach studied provides a self-consistent framework to connect at non-linear level quantities from the primordial universe, such as $\zeta$, written in terms of the light-cone parameters, to late time observables.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Lorentzian Regge calculus: causality violations, massless scalar field and discrete dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model of spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic cosmology in Lorentzian Regge calculus, employing 4-dimensional Lorentzian frusta as building blocks. By examining the causal structure of the discrete spacetimes obtained by gluing such 4-frusta in spatial and temporal direction, we find causality violations if the sub-cells connecting spatial slices are spacelike. A Wick rotation to the Euclidean theory can be defined globally by a complexification of the variables and an analytic continuation of the action. Introducing a discrete free massless scalar field, we study its equations of motion and show that it evolves monotonically. Furthermore, in a continuum limit, we obtain the equations of a homogeneous scalar field on a spatially flat Friedmann background. Vacuum solutions to the causally regular Regge equations are static and flat and show a restoration of time reparametrisation invariance. In the presence of a scalar field, the height of a frustum is a dynamical variable that has a solution if causality violations are absent and if an inequality relating geometric and matter boundary data is satisfied. Edge lengths of cubes evolve monotonically, yielding a contracting or an expanding branch of the universe. In a small deficit angle expansion, the system can be deparametrised via the scalar field and a continuum limit of the discrete theory can be defined which we show to yield the relational Friedmann equation. These properties are obstructed if higher orders of the deficit angle are taken into account. Our results suggest that the inclusion of timelike sub-cells is necessary for a causally regular classical evolution in this symmetry restricted setting. Ultimately, this works serves as a basis for forthcoming investigations on the cosmological path integral within the framework of effective spin foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for describing quantum fluctuations in field theory, with a focus on cosmological applications. Our method uniquely circumvents the use of operator/Hilbert-space formalism, instead relying on a systematic treatment of classical variables, quantum fluctuations, and an effective Hamiltonian. Our framework not only aligns with standard formalisms in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, which assumes no backreaction, demonstrated through the $\varphi^3$-model, but also adeptly handles time-dependent backreaction in more general cases. The uncertainty principle and spatial symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and understanding effective potentials. We discover that modes inside the Hubble horizon \emph{do not} necessarily feel an initial Minkowski vacuum, as is commonly assumed. Our findings offer fresh insights into the early universe's quantum fluctuations and potential explanations to large-scale CMB anomalies.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>

Abstract: Recently Harada has proposed a gravitational theory which is of third order in the derivatives of the metric tensor. This has attracted some attention particularly as it predicts a late-time transition from cosmological decelaration to accelerated expansion without assuming the presence of dark energy or a non-zero cosmological constant. This theory has been dubbed conformal Killing gravity by Mantica &amp; Molinari.
  The most general exact solutions of the Harada field equations are known for a number of important physical situations: homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models, static spherically symmetric vacuum and electrovac spacetimes. These are analogues of the well-known FRWL, Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om metrics of General Relativity(GR). In this study the pp-waves in Harada's theory are studied and the most general exact solution is obtained together with its specialisation for plane waves. The generalisation from GR to Harada's theory turns out to be straightforward and the solutions only involve an extra non-propagating term. The solutions have Petrov type N (or 0) and the Ricci tensor is either zero or the Segr\'e type is [(211)] with zero eigenvalue.
  For any metric in conformal Killing gravity it is shown that more than one possible matter source can generate the solution. If the metric admits one or more Killing vectors, the ambiguity in the possible matter sources increases.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement generation or harvesting between two identical Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime. We consider two comoving two-level detectors at a coincident spatial position. The detectors are assumed to be unentangled initially. The detectors are individually coupled to a scalar field, which eventually leads to coupling between the two detectors. We consider two kinds of scalar fields -- conformally symmetric and massless minimally coupled, for both real and complex cases. By tracing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the scalar field, we construct the reduced density matrix for the two detectors, whose eigenvalues characterise transitions between the energy levels of the detectors. By using the existing results for the detector response functions per unit proper time for these fields, we next compute the logarithmic negativity, quantifying the degree of entanglement generated at late times between the two detectors. The similarities and differences of these results for different kind of scalar fields have been discussed.</description>

Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons that coherently rotate in field space. We show that these coherent rotations can induce superradiance for scattering waves, thanks to the fact that the scattering involves two coupled modes. Despite the conservation of the particle number in the scattering, the mismatch between the frequencies of the two modes allows for the enhancement of the energy and angular momentum of incident waves. When the Q-ball spins in real space, additional rotational superradiance is also possible, which can further boost the enhancements. We identify the criteria for the energy and angular momentum superradiance to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canonical quantization of the photon -- a free massless vector field -- is considered in cosmological spacetimes in a two-parameter family of linear gauges that treat all the vector potential components on equal footing. The goal is setting up a framework for computing photon two-point functions appropriate for loop computations in realistic inflationary spacetimes. The quantization is implemented without relying on spacetime symmetries, but rather it is based on the classical canonical structure. Special attention is paid to the quantization of the canonical first-class constraint structure that is implemented as the condition on the physical states. This condition gives rise to subsidiary conditions that the photon two-point functions must satisfy. Some of the de Sitter space photon propagators from the literature are found not to satisfy these subsidiary conditions, bringing into question their consistency.</description>

      <title>Lorentz invariance violation from GRB221009A</title>

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) reported observation of photons with energies above 10~TeV from gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. A suggestion was proposed that this result may contradict our knowledge of special relativity~(SR) and the standard model~(SM), according to which photons of about 10~TeV from such a distant object should be severely suppressed because of the absorption by extragalactic background light. As a result, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to solve this potential puzzle, including Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV). In this work, we perform a detailed numerical calculation and show the feasibility to constrain LIV of photons from the LHAASO observation of GRB 221009A quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: The present article deals with general mechanics in an unconventional manner. At first, Newtonian mechanics for a point particle has been described in vectorial picture, considering Cartesian, polar and tangent-normal formulations in a unified manner. An extensive differential geometric notions have been used when motion on curved surfaces has been considered. Both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations have been discussed with various examples. The relevant part of the calculus of variation has been presented in the appendix. Also, a detailed study about the nature of the Lagrangian has been shown in the appendix and it has been found that the usual Lagrangian can be extended to curved space-time using the notion of differential geometry. The article may be suitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz invariance violation from Vela pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S) Collaboration reported the discovery of a novel radiation component from the Vela pulsar by their Cherenkov telescopes. It is of great importance that gamma rays with energies of at least 20~TeV are recorded unexpectedly. The H.E.S.S Collaboration argued that such results may challenge the state-of-the-art models for the high-energy emission of pulsars. We point out in this work that these results also provide a unique opportunity to constrain certain Lorentz invariance violation parameters, leading to the realization of studying Lorentz invariance violation by using gamma-ray pulsars. The Lorentz invariance violation scale is constrained at the level of $E_{\mathrm{LV,}1}&gt; 1.66\times 10^{17} \rm GeV$ for the linear scenario, and $E_{\mathrm{LV,}2}&gt;3.53\times 10^{10} \rm GeV$ for the quadratic scenario. We anticipate that digging into the detailed features of the data of the Vela pulsar and analyzing potentially more very-high-energy photon data from pulsars in the future would improve the constraints on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>Observed Trends in FRB Population and Bi-modality in the Luminosity Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave double copy of radiation from gluon shockwave collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we showed that the gravitational wave spectrum from trans-Planckian shockwave scattering in Einstein gravity is determined by the gravitational Lipatov vertex expressed as the bilinear double copy $\Gamma^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 C^\mu C^\nu - \frac12 N^\mu N^\nu$ where $C^\mu$ is the QCD Lipatov vertex and $N^\mu$ is the QED soft photon factor. We show here that this result can be directly obtained by careful application of the classical color-kinematic duality to the spectrum obtained in gluon shockwave collisions.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity of the extended Schwarzschild-de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to static patch holography, de Sitter space admits a unitary quantum description in terms of a dual theory living on the stretched horizon, that is a timelike surface close to the cosmological horizon. In this manuscript, we compute several holographic complexity conjectures in a periodic extension of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. We consider multiple configurations of the stretched horizons to which geometric objects are anchored. The holographic complexity proposals admit a hyperfast growth when the gravitational observables only lie in the cosmological patch, except for a class of complexity=anything observables that admit a linear growth. All the complexity conjectures present a linear increase when restricted to the black hole patch, similar to the AdS case. When both the black hole and the cosmological regions are probed, codimension-zero proposals are time-independent, while codimension-one proposals can have non-trivial evolution with linear increase at late times. As a byproduct of our analysis, we find that codimension-one spacelike surfaces are highly constrained in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space. Therefore, different locations of the stretched horizon give rise to different behaviours of the complexity conjectures.</description>

      <title>The minimal cosmological standard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

      <title>Axi-majoron for almost everything</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref.~\cite{Barenboim:2024akt} are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing a large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the non-restoration of the symmetry and the non-zero PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either the transfer of the PQ-number asymmetry through the seesaw sector, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter is purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves have information about the masse parameters of the lightest left-handed and right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by the long-lived lightest right-handed neutrino species.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(5)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in UGC10667. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario. Given our findings, we conclude that the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A is disfavoured by current state-of-the-art gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaps and Bumps: Spectral Siren Cosmology with Non-Parametric Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens typically require electromagnetic (EM) data to obtain redshift information to constrain cosmology. Difficult to find EM counterparts for bright sirens and galaxy survey systematics for dark sirens make cosmological constraints with spectral sirens, a gravitational wave data-only approach, extremely appealing. In this work, we use the GWTC-3 BBH detections as spectral sirens to constrain the BBH population and the underlying cosmological expansion with a flexible model for the black hole mass spectrum. We use a binned Gaussian process to model the BBH mass distribution in the source frame without any astrophysical assumptions on the shape and or inclusion (or lack of) features that drive the cosmological constraints as the redshifted detector frame masses become consistent with the underlying astrophysical mass distribution features. For GWTC-3 we find a measurement on the Hubble constant of $H_0=73.0^{+13.3}_{-7.7} \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ at $68\%$ C.L. when combined with that obtained from the bright standard siren analysis with GW170817 and its associated host galaxy NGC 4993. We find an improved estimate for the Hubble constant of around a factor of 1.4 times better than the GW170817 measurement alone. We validate our nonparametric spectral siren approach with simulations and benchmark its scalability and constraining performance when compared with parametric methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a model of non-interacting quantum fields satisfying $(\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi=0$ on a Riemannian scattering space $(M,g)$ with two boundary components, i.e. a manifold with two asymptotically conic ends (meaning asymptotic to the "large end" of a cone). Our main result describes a canonical construction of two-point functions satisfying a version of the Hadamard condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in celestial holography, which is holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. This holographic duality exhibits numerous mysterious and fruitful features, particularly on the dual CFT side. In this paper, we present the candidate of dual CFT for Minkowski spacetime extracted from $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/SU(2)\cong H^+_3$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, the simplest non-compact CFT. We demonstrate that it reproduces the well-known principal series and correlation functions dual to the bulk scattering amplitudes.</description>
