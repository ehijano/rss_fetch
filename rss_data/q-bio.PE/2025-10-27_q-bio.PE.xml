      <title>Drivers of Variation in the Optimal Spatial Structure of Collective Information Gatherers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective systems that self-organise to maximise the group's ability to collect and distribute information can be successful in environments with high spatial and temporal variation. Such organisations are abundant in nature, as sharing information is a key benefit of many biological collective systems, and have been influential in the design of many artificial collectives such as swarm robotics. Understanding how these systems may be spatially distributed to optimise their collective potential is therefore of importance in both ecology and in collective systems design. Here, we develop a mathematical model which uses an optimisation framework to determine the higher-order spatial structure of a collective that optimises group-level knowledge transfer. The domain of the objective function is a set of weighted simplicial sets, which can fully represent the spatial structure from a topological perspective. By varying the parameters within the objective function and the constraints, we determine how the optimal spatial structure may vary when individuals differ in their information gathering ability and how this variation differs in the context of resource constraints. Our key findings are that the amount of resources in the environment can lead to specific subgroup sizes being optimal for the group as a whole when individuals are homogeneous in their information gathering abilities. Further, when there is variation in information gathering abilities, our model implies that the sharing of space between smaller subgroups of the population, rather than the whole population, is optimal for collective knowledge sharing. Our results have applications across diverse contexts from behavioural ecology to bio-inspired collective systems design.</description>

      <title>Effect of intratumor heterogeneity in managing the go-or-grow dichotomy of cancer cells: a game theory modeling to understand metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of intratumor heterogeneity in the likelihood of cancer cells moving from a primary tumor to other sites in the human body, generating a metastatic process. We model different scenarios of competition between tumor cells using a static evolutionary game in which cells compete for nutrients and oxygen and might choose to stay and proliferate in the primary tumor or opt to a motility strategy in order to find resources in a metastatic site. The theoretical results found in the evolutionarily equilibrium in the mathematical model are in line with the empirical results observed in oncology, namely, the coexistence of both primary and metastatic tumors and the conditions that favor a metastatic process. Particularly, the model finds mathematical support for what is empirically observed in punctuated and branching cancers for the specific case of clear cell renal cell carcinomas: motility of cells is larger in punctuated cancers if the proportion of BAP1 mutations remain below a given cell proportion threshold.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the lexicon: a probabilistic point of view</title>

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers, variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that taking into account this second random process significantly increases the precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.</description>

      <title>Machine learning augmented diagnostic testing to identify sources of variability in test performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03678</link>

Abstract: Diagnostic tests that can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.</description>

      <title>Continental-scale habitat distribution modelling with multimodal earth observation foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions, vegetation composition and structure that support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. Most habitats face mounting pressures from human activities, which requires accurate, high-resolution habitat mapping for effective conservation and restoration. Yet, current habitat maps often fall short in thematic or spatial resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that complicates exhaustive multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat mapping across large geographical extents at fine spatial and thematic resolution. Using vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled the distribution of Level 3 EUNIS habitat types across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical nature of habitat classifications resolved classification ambiguities, especially in fragmented habitats. Integrating satellite-borne multispectral and radar imagery, particularly through Earth Observation (EO) Foundation models (EO-FMs), enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance. Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted predictive accuracy even further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance temporal modelling of habitat dynamics, extend to habitat segmentation and quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with higher-quality in situ observations.</description>
