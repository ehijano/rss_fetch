      <title>Parallel and algebraic lambda-calculi in intuitionistic propositional logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model that interprets the parallel operator, also present in algebraic calculi, within the context of propositional logic. This interpretation uses the category $\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}$, whose objects are magmas and whose arrows are functions from the category $\mathbf{Set}$, specifically for the case of the parallel lambda calculus. Similarly, we use the category $\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal S}_{\mathbf{Set}}$, whose objects are action magmas and whose arrows are also functions from the category $\mathbf{Set}$, for the case of the algebraic lambda calculus. Our approach diverges from conventional interpretations where disjunctions are handled by coproducts, instead proposing to handle them with the union of disjoint union and the Cartesian product.</description>

      <title>Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents for Trustworthy Social Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA) framework, a novel approach to enhance the trustworthiness of social simulations that utilize large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have gained attention as agents for simulating human behaviour, their applicability in this role is limited by issues such as inherent hallucinations and logical inconsistencies. LELMA addresses these challenges by integrating LLMs with symbolic AI, enabling logical verification of the reasoning generated by LLMs. This verification process provides corrective feedback, refining the reasoning output. The framework consists of three main components: an LLM-Reasoner for producing strategic reasoning, an LLM-Translator for mapping natural language reasoning to logic queries, and a Solver for evaluating these queries. This study focuses on decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios as a model of human interaction. Experiments involving the Hawk-Dove game, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Stag Hunt highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 Omni and Gemini 1.0 Pro, in producing correct reasoning in these contexts. LELMA demonstrates high accuracy in error detection and improves the reasoning correctness of LLMs via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4 Omni.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Constructive and Intuitionistic Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the constructive and intuitionistic variants of the modal logic $\mathsf{KB}$ coincide. This result contrasts with a recent result by Das and Marin, who showed that the constructive and intuitionistic variants of $\mathsf{K}$ do not prove the same diamond-free formulas.</description>

      <title>Termination of Graph Transformation Systems Using Weighted Subgraph Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07812v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a termination method for the algebraic graph transformation framework PBPO+, in which we weigh objects by summing a class of weighted morphisms targeting them. The method is well-defined in rm-adhesive quasitoposes (which include toposes and therefore many graph categories of interest), and is applicable to non-linear rules. The method is also defined for other frameworks, including SqPO and left-linear DPO, because we have previously shown that they are naturally encodable into PBPO+ in the quasitopos setting. We have implemented our method, and the implementation includes a REPL that can be used for guiding relative termination proofs.</description>

      <title>On Complexity Bounds and Confluence of Parallel Term Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit parallel-innermost term rewriting as a model of parallel computation on inductive data structures and provide a corresponding notion of runtime complexity parametric in the size of the start term. We propose automatic techniques to derive both upper and lower bounds on parallel complexity of rewriting that enable a direct reuse of existing techniques for sequential complexity. Our approach to find lower bounds requires confluence of the parallel-innermost rewrite relation, thus we also provide effective sufficient criteria for proving confluence. The applicability and the precision of the method are demonstrated by the relatively light effort in extending the program analysis tool AProVE and by experiments on numerous benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Sharing proofs with predicative theories through universe-polymorphic elaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the development of formal proofs is a time-consuming task, it is important to devise ways of sharing the already written proofs to prevent wasting time redoing them. One of the challenges in this domain is to translate proofs written in proof assistants based on impredicative logics to proof assistants based on predicative logics, whenever impredicativity is not used in an essential way.
  In this paper we present a transformation for sharing proofs with a core predicative system supporting prenex universe polymorphism. It consists in trying to elaborate each term into a predicative universe-polymorphic term as general as possible. The use of universe polymorphism is justified by the fact that mapping each universe to a fixed one in the target theory is not sufficient in most cases. During the elaboration, we need to solve unification problems in the equational theory of universe levels. In order to do this, we give a complete characterization of when a single equation admits a most general unifier. This characterization is then employed in a partial algorithm which uses a constraint-postponement strategy for trying to solve unification problems.
  The proposed translation is of course partial, but in practice allows one to translate many proofs that do not use impredicativity in an essential way. Indeed, it was implemented in the tool Predicativize and then used to translate semi-automatically many non-trivial developments from Matita's library to Agda, including proofs of Bertrand's Postulate and Fermat's Little Theorem, which (as far as we know) were not available in Agda yet.</description>

      <title>The $\mathsf{AC}^0$-Complexity Of Visibly Pushdown Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the question of which visibly pushdown languages (VPLs) are in the complexity class $\mathsf{AC}^0$ and how to effectively decide this question. Our contribution is to introduce a particular subclass of one-turn VPLs, called intermediate VPLs, for which the raised question is entirely unclear: to the best of our knowledge our research community is unaware of containment or non-containment in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ for any language in our newly introduced class.
  Our main result states that there is an algorithm that, given a visibly pushdown automaton, correctly outputs either that its language is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, outputs some $m\geq 2$ such that $L$ is $\mathsf{ACC}^0(m)$-hard (implying that $L$ is not in $\mathsf{AC}^0$), or outputs a finite disjoint union of intermediate VPLs that $L$ is constant-depth equivalent to. In the latter case one can moreover effectively compute $k,l\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ with $k\not=l$ such that the concrete intermediate VPL $L(S\rightarrow\varepsilon\mid a c^{k-1} S b_1\mid ac^{l-1}Sb_2)$ is constant-depth reducible to the language $L$. Due to their particular nature we conjecture that either all intermediate VPLs are in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ or all are not. As a corollary of our main result we obtain that in case the input language is a visibly counter language our algorithm can effectively determine if it is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ -- hence our main result generalizes a result by Krebs et al. stating that it is decidable if a given visibly counter language is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ (when restricted to well-matched words).
  For our proofs we revisit so-called Ext-algebras (introduced by Czarnetzki et al.), which are closely related to forest algebras (introduced by Boja\'nczyk and Walukiewicz), and use Green's relations.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
