      <title>Dose rate dependence of TID damage to 65 nm CMOS transistors in X-ray irradiations of the ATLAS ITk Pixel ASIC (ITkPix)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) requires a radiation-tolerant pixel readout chip, which must withstand a total ionising dose (TID) of up to 1 Grad. The readout ASIC for the ITk upgrade has been designed by the RD53 collaboration using 65 nm CMOS technology. In order to characterise the radiation tolerance of the chip digital logic, the RD53 ASICs include ring oscillators, which can be used to measure gate delay degradation. Extensive X-ray irradiation studies of the ring oscillators have been performed on the ITk Pixel pre-production readout ASIC, ITkPixV1. A dependence of radiation damage on dose rate has been observed in 65 nm CMOS technology. This paper aims to quantify the dose rate dependence of TID damage to the ITkPix ring oscillators and, therefore, the ITkPix ASIC digital logic. X-ray irradiations at different dose rates between 20 krad/h and 30 Mrad/h are compared. A dose rate dependence is observed, with 2-3 times more damage at the lowest dose rate of 20 krad/h, compared to 4 Mrad/h. The dose rate dependence was also observed to be dependent on transistor size and type.</description>

      <title>A beam-driven proton irradiation setup for precision radiation damage tests of silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proton irradiation site for silicon detectors has been developed and commissioned at the Bonn Isochronous Cyclotron. The accelerator provides 14 MeV proton beams of up to 1 $\mu$A at beam widths of a few mm to the setup. Devices Under Test (DUTs) are irradiated inside a cooled, thermally-insulated box at $\le$-20{\deg}C, while being moved through the beam in a row-based scan pattern to achieve uniform fluence distributions. Custom-made diagnostics allow for beam-based, on- and offline dosimetry, enabling a beam-driven irradiation routine which produces uniform fluence distributions with standard deviations $ \ll 1 \% $. Dedicated irradiations of thin titanium foils are performed to compare the commonly-used dosimetry via metallic foil activation to the beam-based approach. Within the error margins, both methods are in agreement, whereas the beam-based technique yields lower uncertainties of typically $ \le 2 \% $. Simulations indicate a reduction of the initial proton energy to 12.28(6) MeV on the DUT. Characterization of six, 150 $\mu$m-thin, passive LFoundry sensors before and after irradiation yield a proton hardness factor of $\kappa_\text{p}=3.71(11)$, which is in agreement with expectations, allowing to irradiate up to $10^{16} \text{n}_{eq} / \text{cm}^2$ within a few hours.</description>

      <title>Study on the static detection of ICF target based on muonic X-ray sphere encoded imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) was discovered by Chinese physicist Zhang Wenyu as early as 1947, and it can conduct non-destructive elemental analysis inside samples. Research has shown that MIXE can retain the high efficiency of direct imaging while benefiting from the low noise of pinhole imaging through encoding holes. The related technology significantly improves the counting rate while maintaining imaging quality. The sphere encoding technology effectively solves the imaging blurring caused by the tilting of the encoding system, and successfully images micrometer sized X-ray sources. This paper will combine MIXE and X-ray sphere coding imaging techniques, including ball coding and zone plates, to study the method of non-destructive deep structure imaging of ICF targets and obtaining sub element distribution. This method aims to develop a new method for ICF target detection, which is particularly important for inertial confinement fusion. At the same time, this method can be used to detect and analyze materials that are difficult to penetrate or sensitive, and is expected to solve the problem of element resolution and imaging that traditional technologies cannot overcome. It will provide new methods for the future development of multiple fields such as particle physics, material science, and X-ray optics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic measurements and models of energy deposition in the substrate of quantum circuits by natural ionizing radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naturally occurring background radiation is a source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. To characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background events in silicon substrates located inside a millikelvin refrigerator, an environment representative of superconducting qubit systems. We measured the background spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, and obtained the average event rate and the integrated power deposition. In a 25 mm^2 area and the thinner substrate, these values are 0.023 events per second and 4.9 keV/s, counting events that deposit at least 40 keV. We find the background spectrum to be nearly featureless. Its intensity decreases by a factor of 40,000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for silicon substrates 0.5 mm thick. We find the cryogenic measurements to be in good agreement with predictions based on measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. No free parameters are required to predict the background spectra in the silicon substrates. The good agreement between measurements and predictions allow assessment of the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic background sources and their dependence on substrate thickness. Our spectroscopic measurements are performed with superconducting microresonators that transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. We find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events depositing E&lt;1.5 MeV, while nucleons among the cosmic-ray secondary particles cause most events that deposit more energy. These results suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Directional Filter Design and Simulation for Superconducting On-chip Filter-banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many superconducting on-chip filter-banks suffer from poor coupling to the detectors behind each filter. This is a problem intrinsic to the commonly used half wavelength filter, which has a maximum theoretical coupling of 50 %. In this paper we introduce a phase coherent filter, called a directional filter, which has a theoretical coupling of 100 %. In order to to study and compare different types of filter-banks, we first analyze the measured filter frequency scatter, losses, and spectral resolution of a DESHIMA 2.0 filter-bank chip. Based on measured fabrication tolerances and losses, we adapt the input parameters for our circuit simulations, quantitatively reproducing the measurements. We find that the frequency scatter is caused by nanometer-scale line-width variations and that variances in the spectral resolution is caused by losses in the dielectric only. Finally, we include these realistic parameters in a full filter-bank model and simulate a wide range of spectral resolutions and oversampling values. For all cases the directional filter-bank has significantly higher coupling to the detectors than the half-wave resonator filter-bank. The directional filter eliminates the need to use oversampling as a method to improve the total efficiency, instead capturing nearly all the power remaining after dielectric losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of experiments investigating properties of neutrons can be performed at pulsed reactor neutron sources like the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. A typical problem faced by these experiments is the non-availability of a reliable facility-provided trigger signal in coincidence with the neutron production. Here we present the design and implementation of a neutron pulse detector that provides a coincident trigger signal for experimental timing with a relative precision of 4.5 ms.</description>

      <title>Deep generative models for fast photon shower simulation in ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need for large-scale production of highly accurate simulated event samples for the extensive physics programme of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider motivates the development of new simulation techniques. Building on the recent success of deep learning algorithms, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are investigated for modelling the response of the central region of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to photons of various energies. The properties of synthesised showers are compared with showers from a full detector simulation using GEANT4. Both variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are capable of quickly simulating electromagnetic showers with correct total energies and stochasticity, though the modelling of some shower shape distributions requires more refinement. This feasibility study demonstrates the potential of using such algorithms for ATLAS fast calorimeter simulation in the future and shows a possible way to complement current simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Limiting noise and outliers in the MICROSCOPE space test of the weak equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MICROSCOPE space mission has tested the weak equivalence principle finding no violation to about 1e-15, about two orders of magnitude better than on the ground. We review this result looking for lessons for the future. The acceleration difference of the falling bodies is limited by random thermal noise attributed to losses in the tiny gold wire which connects each of them to the enclosing cage. Our analysis reveals anomalies which are inexplicable within the current best knowledge of such noise. The anomalies may be due to a fluctuating sub-microVolt potential caused by electric charge patches on the surface of the test bodies and the electrodes coupled to large acceleration/voltage biases. Since the acceleration difference is derived from the individual measurements of each test body, it depends upon their arbitrarily defined zero, and this causes the bias. The measurement data show a large number of outliers, acceleration spikes (glitches) induced by thermal stress from the Earth and the Sun on the insulating blankets of the spacecraft. They occur at the synodic frequency relative to Earth (also the frequency of a violation signal) and the Sun, their harmonics and their difference. Outliers are removed and the ensuing gaps (up to 35%, 40% of the data) are filled with artificial data. However, gaps and artificial data retain memory of the outliers they have replaced and may therefore mimic a violation signal or cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An existing alternative approach relying solely on measured data would make the result of the experiment fully robust and unquestionable. A correct model of the stiffness of the wire, the presence of a fluctuating patch potential noise with the same frequency dependence as thermal noise from internal damping, as well as an insulation that does not give rise to glitches, were all anticipated by the GOCE gravity mission.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spectrum of the BULLKID detector array operated on surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first continuous operation in a surface lab of BULLKID, a detector for searches of light Dark Matter and precision measurements of the coherent and elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The detector consists of an array of 60 cubic silicon particle absorbers of 0.34 g each, sensed by cryogenic kinetic inductance detectors. The data presented focusses on one of the central elements of the array and on its surrounding elements used as veto. The energy spectrum resulting from an exposure of 39 hours to ambient backgrounds, obtained without radiation shields, is flat at the level of $(2.0\pm0.1\,{\rm stat.}\pm0.2\,{\rm syst.})\times10^6$ counts / keV kg days down to the energy threshold of $160\pm13$ eV. The data analysis demonstrates the unique capability of rejecting backgrounds generated from interactions in other sites of the array, stemming from the segmented and monolithic structure of the detector.</description>

      <title>A High-Finesse Suspended Interferometric Sensor for Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics with Femtometre Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interferometric sensor for investigating macroscopic quantum mechanics on a table-top scale. The sensor consists of pair of suspended optical cavities with a finesse in excess of 100,000 comprising 10 g fused-silica mirrors. In the current room-temperature operation, we achieve a peak sensitivity of \SI{0.5}{\fmasd} in the acoustic frequency band, limited by the readout noise. With additional suppression of the readout noise, we will be able to reach the quantum radiation pressure noise, which would represent a novel measurement of the quantum back-action effect. Such a sensor can eventually be utilised for demonstrating macroscopic entanglement and testing semi-classical and quantum gravity models.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis Methods Preliminaries for a Photon-based Hardware Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High quality random numbers are necessary in the modern world. Ranging from encryption keys in cyber security to models and simulations for scientific use: it's important that these random numbers are of high quality and quickly attainable. One common solution to the generation of random numbers is that of pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs. PRNGs generate random numbers by first quantifying some unpredictable phenomena into a number or string and feeding it into an algorithm which yields numbers randomly based on that seed. Easy places to find seeds include the user's mouse movements or the machine's uptime. These are only pseudorandom, however, as if given the same seed twice, the PRNG would generate the same 'random' output. This is great for games like Minecraft, but not so great for cybersecurity encryption key generation. By using a hardware random number generator (HRNG), random numbers that are not susceptible to the flaws found in PRNGs can be attained at a high rate.</description>
