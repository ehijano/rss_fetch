      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and a variety of methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For instance, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by considering tail risk. These methods often depend on distributional information estimated from historical data using predictive models, each of which carries its own uncertainty. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection via conformal prediction , called \emph{Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection} (CPPS). Our approach forecasts future portfolio returns, computes the corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the portfolio of interest based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a wide range of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPPS framework by applying it to an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it delivers superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Guided Deep Learning for Large-Scale Constrained Dynamic Portfolio Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) method for constrained dynamic portfolio choice - incorporating consumption and multi-asset investment - that scales to thousands of risky assets. By combining neural-network controls with Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), it circumvents the curse of dimensionality that renders dynamic programming (DP) grids intractable beyond a handful of assets. Unlike value-based PDE or BSDE approaches, PG-DPO enforces PMP conditions at each gradient step, naturally accommodating no-short-selling or borrowing constraints and optional consumption bounds. A "one-shot" variant rapidly computes Pontryagin-optimal controls after a brief warm-up, leading to substantially higher accuracy than naive baselines. On modern GPUs, near-optimal solutions often emerge within just one or two minutes of training. Numerical experiments show that in the unconstrained case, PG-DPO recovers the known closed-form solution even at 10,000 assets, while under constraints it remains tractable up to 1,000 assets - both well beyond the long-standing DP-based limit of fewer than seven.</description>
