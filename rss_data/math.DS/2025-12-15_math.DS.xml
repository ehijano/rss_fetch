      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorems for geodesic flows on nonpositively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a nonstandard central limit theorem and weak invariance principle, with superdiffusive normalisation $(t\log t)^{1/2}$, for geodesic flows on a class of nonpositively curved surfaces with flat cylinder. We also prove that correlations decay at rate $t^{-1}$. An important ingredient of the proof, which is of independent interest, is an improved results on the regularity of the stable/unstable foliations induced by the Green bundles.</description>

      <title>Results for Global Attractivity of Interior Equilibrium Points for Lotka-Volterra Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides global attractivity results for the interior equilibrium point of a general Lotka-Volterra system with no restriction on the dimension of the system and with no special structure or properties of the interaction matrix. The main result contains as special cases all known general results, including the Volterra-Lyapunov theorem and the recently proposed eigenvector conditions. Moreover, global attractivity of the interior equilibrium point is shown for a three-dimensional example, where none of the existing general results can be applied.</description>

      <title>On a tree of rational functions related to continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a binary tree with vertices given by rational functions $p(x)/q(x)$; the root and functional derivation of children are inspired by continued fractions. We prove some special properties of the tree. For example, the zero solutions of the denominators $q(x)$ are all real negative numbers and are dense in $(-\infty,-1]$. For $x&gt;0$ functions are non intersecting and form a dense subset of $(0,1)$. Furthermore, when evaluating the tree for positive rational values, the tree contains every rational in $(0,1)$ exactly once if and only if $x\in \mathbb{N}$. For $x=1$, one finds back the classical Farey tree which is related to regular continued fractions. In the last part, we will make a similar tree in a similar way but for backward continued fractions. We highlight some similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Global stability of epidemic models with uniform susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases are often studied using compartmental mathematical models, which are commonly represented as systems of autonomous ordinary differential equations. A key step in the analysis of such models is to identify equilibria and find conditions for their stability. Local stability analysis reduces to a problem in linear algebra, but there is no general algorithm for establishing global stability properties. Substantial progress on global stability of epidemic models has been made in the last 20 years, primarily by successfully applying Lyapunov's method to specific systems. Here, we show that any compartmental epidemic model in which susceptible individuals cannot be distinguished and can be infected only once, has a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) equilibrium. If the basic reproduction number ${R}_0$ satisfies ${R}_0 &gt; 1$, then the GAS fixed point is an endemic equilibrium (i.e., constant, positive disease prevalence). Alternatively, if ${R}_0 \le 1$, then the GAS equilibrium is disease-free. This theorem subsumes a large number of results published over the last century, strengthens most of them by establishing global rather than local stability, avoids the need for any stability analyses of these systems in the future, and settles the question of whether co-existing stable solutions or non-equilibrium attractors are possible in such models: they are not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zaremba's conjecture concerns a formation of continued fraction expansions for rational numbers with partial quotient bounded by an absolute constant. We present asymptotic estimates for the size of $\epsilon$-thickening of certain fractal sets of bounded-type, which in turn provide additional support for Zaremba's conjecture on average. We also conclude a generalisation for complex continued fractions over imaginary quadratic fields.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcations of a minimal model for the effect of PrEP-related risk compensation in epidemics of sexually transmitted infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drastically reduces the risk of HIV infection if taken as prescribed, providing almost perfect protection even during unprotected sexual intercourse. Although this has been transformative in reducing new HIV infections among high-risk populations, it has also been linked to an increase in risk practices -- a phenomenon known as risk compensation -- thereby favoring the spread of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) deemed less severe. In this paper, we study a minimal compartmental model describing the effect of risk awareness and risk compensation due to PrEP on the spread of other STIs among a high-infection-risk group of men who have sex with men (MSM). The model integrates three key elements of risk-mediated behavior and PrEP programs: (i) HIV risk awareness drives self-protective behaviors (such as condom use and voluntary STI screening); (ii) individuals on PrEP are subject to risk compensation, but (iii) are required to screen for asymptomatic STIs frequently. We derived the basic reproduction number of the system, $R_0$, and found a transcritical bifurcation at $R_0=1$, where the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and an endemic equilibrium emerges. This endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable wherever it exists. We identified critical thresholds in behavioral and policy parameters that separate these regimes and analyzed typical values for plausible parameter choices. Beyond the specific epidemiological context, the model serves as a general framework for studying nonlinear interactions between behavioral adaptation, preventive interventions, and disease dynamics, providing insights into how feedback mechanisms can lead to non-trivial responses in epidemic systems. Finally, our model can be easily extended to study the effect of interventions and risk compensation in other STIs.</description>

      <title>Model Error Resonance: The Geometric Nature of Error Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric theory of model error, treating true and model dynamics as geodesic flows generated by distinct affine connections on a smooth manifold. When these connections differ, the resulting trajectory discrepancy--termed the Latent Error Dynamic Response (LEDR)--acquires an intrinsic dynamical structure governed by curvature. We show that the LEDR satisfies a Jacobi-type equation, where curvature mismatch acts as an explicit forcing term. In the important case of a flat model connection, the LEDR reduces to a classical Jacobi field on the true manifold, causing Model Error Resonance (MER) to emerge under positive sectional curvature. The theory is extended to a discrete-time analogue, establishing that this geometric structure and its resonant behavior persist in sampled systems. A closed-form analysis of a sphere--plane example demonstrates that curvature can be inferred directly from the LEDR evolution. This framework provides a unified geometric interpretation of structured error dynamics and offers foundational tools for curvature-informed model validation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Hyperspace of Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamics of induced map $2^f$ of a given pointwise periodic homeomorphism $f:X\to X$ of a compact metric space $X$. First, we show that the topological entropy of $2^f$ is zero, i.e. $h_{top}(2^f)=0$ and that the set of almost periodic points coincides with the set of uniformly recurrent points, i.e. $AP(2^f)=UR(2^f)$. Furthermore, we prove that inside any infinite $\omega$-limit set $\omega_{2^f}(A)$ there is a unique minimal set and this minimal set is an adding machine. As a consequence, $(2^X,2^f)$ has no Devaney chaotic subsystems. In contrast to these rigidity properties, we obtain some results with chaotic flavor. In fact, we prove the following dichotomy, the hyperspace system $(2^X,2^f)$ is either equicontinuous or choatic with respect to Li-Yorke chaos and $\omega$-chaos. It is shown that the later case occurs if and only if $R(2^f)\setminus AP(2^f)\neq\emptyset$. This enables us to provide simple examples of pointwise periodic homeomorphisms with chaotic induced systems.</description>

Abstract: We show that for $g\ge 2$, all integers $1 \le d \le 3g-3$ arise as trace field degrees of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes in the Torelli group of the closed orientable surface of genus $g$. Our method uses the Thurston-Veech construction of pseudo-Anosov maps, and we provide examples where the stretch factor has algebraic degree any even number between two and $6g-6$. This validates a claim by Thurston from the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Echoes of the past: A unified perspective on fading memory and echo states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present several new findings regarding the concepts of orbit-transitivity, strict orbit-transitivity, $\omega$-transitivity, and $\mu$-open-set transitivity for self-maps on generalized topological spaces.
  Let $(X,\mu)$ denote a generalized topological space. A point $x \in X$ is said to be \textit{quasi-$\mu$-isolated} if there exists a $\mu$-open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $i_\mu(U \setminus c_\mu(\{x\})) = \emptyset$. We prove that $x$ is a quasi-$\mu$-isolated point of $X$ precisely when there exists a $\mu$-dense subset $D$ of $X$ for which $x$ is a $\mu_D$-isolated point of $D$. Moreover, in the case where $X$ has no quasi-$\mu$-isolated points, we establish that a map $f: X \to X$ is orbit-transitive (or strictly orbit-transitive) if and only if it is $\omega$-transitive.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</description>
