      <title>Transformation relations for UBV photometric system of 1m telescope at the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK National Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UBV CCD observations of standard stars selected from Landolt (2009, 2013) were performed using the 1-meter telescope (T100) of the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK National Observatory equipped with a back-illuminated and UV enhanced CCD camera and Bessell UBV filters. Observations span a long time from the years 2012 to 2024, 50 photometric nights in total. Photometric measurements were used to find the standard transformation relations of the T100 photometric system. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, zero points and transformation coefficients of each night were determined. It could not be found time dependence of the secondary extinction coefficients. However, it was determined that the primary extinction coefficients decreased until the year 2019 and increased after that year. It could not be found a strong seasonal variation of the extinction coefficients. Small differences in seasonal median values of them were used to attempt to find the atmospheric extinction sources. We found calculated minus catalogue values for each standard star, $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$. Means and standard deviations of $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$ were estimated to be 1.4$\pm$76, 1.9$\pm$18 and 0.0$\pm$36 mmag, respectively. We found that our data well matched Landolt's standards for $V$ and $B-V$, i.e. there are no systematic differences. However, there are systematic differences for $U-B$ between the two photometric systems, which is probably originated from the quantum efficiency differences of the detectors used in the photometric systems, although the median differences are relatively small ($|\Delta(U-B)|$&lt; 50 mmag) for stars with $-0.5&lt;U-B~{(\rm mag)} &lt;1.6$ and $0.2&lt;B-V~{(\rm mag)} &lt;1.8$. As an overall result, we conclude that the transformation relations found in this study can be used for standardized photometry with the T100 photometric system.</description>

      <title>Imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of the red supergiant WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant mass loss in the red supergiant (RSG) phase has great influence on the evolution of massive stars and their final fate as supernovae. We present near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment of the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric imaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals elongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5 mas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the stellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020 is much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust torus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a significant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the (spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum of the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data taken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with very weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between December 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained in 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The compact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change suggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to the monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of the central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of a bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.</description>

      <title>The hidden magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament revealed by the injected flare material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.</description>

      <title>An upper limit on the frequency of short-period black hole companions to Sun-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 251 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.</description>

      <title>Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Measurements and simulations of rate coefficients for the deuterated forms of the H2 + + H2 and H3 + + H2 reactive systems at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate coefficients of various isotopic variations of the H2+ + H2 and H3+ + H2 reactions in the 10-250 K temperature range were measured using a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. The processes involving diatomic ions were found to behave close to the Langevin rate, whereas temperature-dependent rate coefficients were obtained for the four isotopic exchange processes with triatomic ions. Fitting the experimental data using a chemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients that were not directly measured in the ion trap. The reported rate coefficients suggest a more efficient hydrogenation of deuterated H3+ forms than usually assumed in astrochemical models, which might affect deuteration rates in warmer environments.</description>

      <title>Latitude Quenching Nonlinearity in the Solar Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two candidate nonlinearities for regulating the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton paradigm: tilt quenching (whereby the tilt of active regions is reduced in stronger cycles) and latitude quenching (whereby flux emerges at higher latitudes in stronger solar cycles). Digitized historical observations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions from 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca II K synoptic maps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot measurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but much stronger evidence for latitude-quenching. Further, we use proxy observations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface flux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit is obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference model where all polarities are filled using Hale's Law. The optimization suggests clearly that the "dynamo effectivity range" of the Sun during this period should be less than 10 degrees; this is also consistent with latitude quenching being dominant over tilt quenching.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J171013+532646: a detached short-period non-eclipsing hot subdwarf + white dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of LAMOST J171013.211+532646.04 (hereafter J1710), a binary system comprising a hot subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf (WD) companion. Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals an orbital period of 109.20279 minutes, consistent with TESS and ZTF photometric data, marking it as the sixth detached system known to harbor a WD companion with a period less than two hours. J1710 is remarkably close to Earth, situated at a distance of only \(350.68^{+4.20}_{-4.21} \, \mathrm{pc}\), with a GAIA G-band magnitude of 12.59, rendering it conducive for continuous observations. The spectral temperature is around 25164 K, in agreement with SED fitting results (\(25301^{+839}_{-743} \, \mathrm{K}\)). The TESS light curve displays ellipsoidal variation and Doppler beaming without eclipsing features. Through fitting the TESS light curve using the Wilson-Devinney code, we determined the masses for the sdB (\(M_1 = 0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)) and the compact object (\(M_2 = 0.54^{+0.10}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)), with the compact object likely being a WD. Furthermore, MESA models suggest that the sdB, with a helium core mass of 0.431 \(M_{\odot}\) and a hydrogen envelope mass of \(1.3 \times 10^{-3}\, M_{\odot}\), is in the early helium main-sequence phase. The MESA binary evolution shows that the J1710 system is expected to evolve into a double white dwarf system, making it an important source of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Temporal-spatial distribution of YSOs nearby Taurus region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar radiative zone spin down problem is treated without internal gravity waves, IGW. The shear-only model of the Reynolds stresses adopted thus far in all calculations, is substituted by a shear vorticity model. The latter component is shown to play a role analogous to the IGW and with a similar time scale of about 107years.</description>

      <title>Identifying Hierarchically Triple Star Systems with Gaia DR3 and LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.</description>

      <title>A distance measurement of galaxies from JWST using star formation rate-stellar mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We obtain a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$, and 51 others at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. On the other hand, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on the absolute UV magnitude ${M_{UV}}$, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has an absolute magnitude dependence. Finally, we apply a combination of galaxies and Type Ia supernova (SNIa) Pantheon to test the property of dark energy concerning whether or not its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical results.</description>

      <title>Solar GES-structure modified with EiBI gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, considered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativity formalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to study the dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitational effects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitational Poisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor, termed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity in the basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existing solar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model is accordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on the Gravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasma structure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics is noticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-model studies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows the EiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centric radial location $\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBI gravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the original Newtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solar parameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Mach numbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses could be applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamics in realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both the bounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Lithium Enhancement in Polluted White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644$-$0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644$-$0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal's origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>New insight of time-transformed symplectic integrator I: hybrid methods for hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.</description>

Abstract: We present the MULTIMODAL UNIVERSE, a large-scale multimodal dataset of scientific astronomical data, compiled specifically to facilitate machine learning research. Overall, the MULTIMODAL UNIVERSE contains hundreds of millions of astronomical observations, constituting 100\,TB of multi-channel and hyper-spectral images, spectra, multivariate time series, as well as a wide variety of associated scientific measurements and "metadata". In addition, we include a range of benchmark tasks representative of standard practices for machine learning methods in astrophysics. This massive dataset will enable the development of large multi-modal models specifically targeted towards scientific applications.

      <title>An unbiased statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

      <title>Increased Surface Temperatures of Habitable White Dwarf Worlds Relative to Main-Sequence Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars - a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature - and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.</description>

      <title>Low-latitude magnetic flux emergence on rapidly rotating solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides a dense coverage of their high latitudes by starspots, rapidly rotating cool stars also display low-latitude spots in Doppler images, although generally with a lower coverage. In contrast, flux emergence models of fast-rotating stars predict strong poleward deflection of radially rising magnetic flux as the Coriolis effect dominates over buoyancy, leaving a spot-free band around the equator. To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a flux tube near the base of the convection zone in a solar-type star rotating eight times faster than the Sun, assuming field intensification by weak-tube explosions. For the intensification to continue into to the buoyancy-dominated regime, the upper convection zone must have a significantly steeper temperature gradient than in the Sun, by a factor that is comparable with that found in 3D simulations of rotating convection. Within the hypothesis that stellar active regions stem from the base of the convection zone, flux emergence between 1-20 degree latitudes requires highly supercritical field strengths of up to 500 kG in rapidly rotating stars. These field strengths require explosions of 100-kG tubes within the convection zone, compatible with reasonable values of the superadiabatic temperature gradient associated with the more rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>A study of particle acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>

Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: The case of the RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event that occurred in 2006. This outburst represents the first nova event ever detected at very high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multiwavelength observations were triggered by this event. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and to determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows expanding on opposite sides of the core in the east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average projected speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 9$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim400$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by \textit{Gaia} DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes into the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $6.4 \times 10^{-6} ~~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and into the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At almost the same time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root mean square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>
