      <title>Secant varieties of Segre-Veronese varieties $\mathbb{P}^m\times\mathbb{P}^n$ embedded by $\mathcal{O}(1,2)$ are non-defective for $n\gg m^3$, $m\geq3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any $m\geq3$, $n\gg m^3$, all secant varieties of the Segre-Veronese variety $\mathbb{P}^m\times\mathbb{P}^n$ have the expected dimension. This was already proved by Abo and Brambilla in the subabundant case, hence we focus on the superabundant case. We generalize an approach due to Brambilla and Ottaviani into a construction we call the inductant. With this, the proof of non-defectivity reduces to checking a finite collection of base cases, which we verify using a computer-assisted proof.</description>

      <title>A quadrilateral half-turn theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $ABC$ is a given triangle in the plane, $P$ is any point not on the extended sides of $ABC$ or its anticomplementary triangle, $Q$ is the complement of the isotomic conjugate of $P$ with respect to $ABC$, $DEF$ is the cevian triangle of $P$, and $D_0$ and $A_0$ are the midpoints of segments $BC$ and $EF$, respectively, a synthetic proof is given for the fact that the complete quadrilateral defined by the lines $AP, AQ, D_0Q, D_0A_0$ is perspective by a Euclidean half-turn to the similarly defined complete quadrilateral for the isotomic conjugate $P'$ of $P$ . This fact is used to define and prove the existence of a generalized circumcenter and generalized orthocenter for any such point $P$.</description>

      <title>Uniform vector bundles over $\mathbb{P}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long-standing conjecture which states that every uniform algebraic vector bundle of rank $r&lt;2n$ on the $n$-dimensional projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ is homogeneous. This conjecture is valid for $n\leq3$. In this paper, we classify all uniform vector bundles of rank $r&lt;8$ over $\mathbb{P}^4$ and show that the conjecture holds for $n=4$.</description>

      <title>Positivity on Blow-up of hyperelliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_r$ denote the blow-up of the hyperelliptic surface $X$ at $r$ very general points. In this paper, we first provide a criterion for the ampleness of a line bundle on $X_r$ and compare it with an existing result. We then study the multi-point Seshadri constants of ample line bundles on hyperelliptic surfaces $X$. Next, we compute single-point Seshadri constants on $X_r$ for specific ample line bundles on odd types. Furthermore, we show that the global Seshadri constants for certain ample line bundles on blow-up of hyperelliptic surfaces are rational.</description>

      <title>Prym loci of branched double coverings and generalized Andreotti-Mayer loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andreotti-Mayer locus is a subset of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties, defined by a condition on the dimension of the singular locus of the theta divisor. It is known that the Jacobian locus in the moduli space is an irreducible component of the Andreotti-Mayer locus. In this paper, we generalize the Andreotti-Mayer locus to the case of the moduli space of abelian varieties with non-principal polarization and prove that the Prym locus of branched double coverings is an irreducible component of the generalized Andreotti-Mayer locus.</description>

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a ponted cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Real Tropical Quartics and their Bitangents: Counting with Patchworking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain tropical quartic curves the existing techniques could not predict the lifting behavior of their bitangents over the real numbers. We close this gap by using patchworking techniques. Further, this paper provides an analysis of the combinatorial types of real tropical quartic curves according to their real topology and number of real bitangents. This paper is accompanied by an extension for polymake; the computational data is available in the database collection polyDB.</description>

      <title>Algebrogeometric subgroups of mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new constraints for algebrogeometric subgroups of mapping class groups, namely images of fundamental groups of curves under complex algebraic maps to the moduli space of smooth curves. Specifically, we prove that the restriction of an infinite, finite rank unitary representation of the mapping class group to an algebrogeometric subgroup should be infinite, when the genus is at least 3. In particular the restriction of most Reshetikhin-Turaev representations of the mapping class group to such subgroups is infinite. To this purpose we use deep work of Gibney, Keel and Morrison to constrain the Shafarevich morphism associated to a linear representation of the fundamental group of the compactifications of the moduli stack of smooth curves studied in our previous work. As an application we prove that universal covers of most of these compactifications are Stein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-free tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free tensors are tensors which, after a change of bases, have free support: any two distinct elements of its support differ in at least two coordinates. They play a distinguished role in the theory of bilinear complexity, in particular in Strassen's duality theory for asymptotic rank. Within the context of quantum information theory, where tensors are interpreted as multiparticle quantum states, freeness corresponds to a type of multiparticle Schmidt decomposition. In particular, if a state is free in a given basis, the reduced density matrices are diagonal. Although generic tensors in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ are non-free for $n \geq 4$ by parameter counting, no explicit non-free tensors were known until now. We solve this hay in a haystack problem by constructing explicit tensors that are non-free for every $n \geq 3$. In particular, this establishes that non-free tensors exist in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, where they are not generic.
  To establish non-freeness, we use results from geometric invariant theory and the theory of moment polytopes. In particular, we show that if a tensor $T$ is free, then there is a tensor $S$ in the GL-orbit closure of $T$, whose support is free and whose moment map image is the minimum-norm point of the moment polytope of $T$. This implies a reduction for checking non-freeness from arbitrary basis changes of $T$ to unitary basis changes of $S$. The unitary equivariance of the moment map can then be combined with the fact that tensors with free support have diagonal moment map image, in order to further restrict the set of relevant basis changes.</description>

      <title>The moment polytope of matrix multiplication is not maximal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment polytopes of tensors, the study of which is deeply rooted in invariant theory, representation theory and symplectic geometry, have found relevance in numerous places, from quantum information (entanglement polytopes) and algebraic complexity theory (GCT program and the complexity of matrix multiplication) to optimization (scaling algorithms). Towards an open problem in algebraic complexity theory, we prove separations between the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication tensors and unit tensors. As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity.
  Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-exponential functions and Ehrhart fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions on rational fans. Motivated by lattice-point counting in polytopes, we introduce a special class of unimodular fans called Ehrhart fans, whose rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions admit a canonical linear functional that behaves like a lattice-point count. In particular, we verify that all complete unimodular fans are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional agrees with lattice-point counting in corresponding polytopes, which can otherwise be interpreted as holomorphic Euler characteristics of vector bundles on smooth toric varieties. We also prove that all Bergman fans of matroids are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional in this case agrees with the Euler characteristic of matroids, introduced recently by Larson, Li, Payne, and Proudfoot. A key property that we prove about the Ehrharticity of fans is that it only depends on the support of the fan, not on the fan structure, thus providing a uniform framework for studying K-rings and Euler characteristics of complete fans and Bergman fans simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Tropical Bisectors and Carlini-Wagner Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pasque et al. showed that using a tropical symmetric metric as an activation function in the last layer can improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against state-of-the-art attacks, including the Carlini-Wagner attack. This improvement occurs when the attacks are not specifically adapted to the non-differentiability of the tropical layer. Moreover, they showed that the decision boundary of a tropical CNN is defined by tropical bisectors. In this paper, we explore the combinatorics of tropical bisectors and analyze how the tropical embedding layer enhances robustness against Carlini-Wagner attacks. We prove an upper bound on the number of linear segments the decision boundary of a tropical CNN can have. We then propose a refined version of the Carlini-Wagner attack, specifically tailored for the tropical architecture. Computational experiments with MNIST and LeNet5 showcase our attacks improved success rate.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of stringy motives under Galois quasi-\'etale covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of stringy motives under Galois quasi-\'etale covers. We prove that they descend under such covers in a sense defined via their Poincar\'e realizations. Further, we show that such descent is strict in the presence of ramification. As a corollary, we reduce the problem regarding the finiteness of the \'etale fundamental group of KLT singularities to a DCC property for their stringy motives. We verify such DCC property for surfaces in arbitrary characteristic. As an application, we give a characteristic-free proof for the finiteness of the \'etale fundamental group of log terminal surface singularities, which was unknown in equal characteristics 2 and 3 and in mixed characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a classical construction in real algebraic geometry. Although there are many algorithms to compute a cylindrical algebraic decomposition, their practical performance is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit this problem from a more geometric perspective, where the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition is related to the study of morphisms between real varieties. It is showed that the geometric fiber cardinality (geometric property) decides the existence of semi-algebraic continuous sections (semi-algebraic property). As a result, all equations can be systematically exploited in the projection phase, leading to a new simple algorithm whose efficiency is demonstrated by experimental results.</description>

      <title>Rank-two reflexive sheaves on the projective space with second Chern class equal to four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rank-two reflexive sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^3$ with $c_2 =4$, expanding on previous results for $c_2\le3$. We show that every spectrum not previously ruled out is realized. Moreover, moduli spaces are studied and described in detail for $c_1=-1$ or $0$ and $c_3\ge8$.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Seminormal toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a combinatorial description of seminormal toric varieties. The corresponding combinatorial object is a fan equipped with a collection of groups assigned to each cone. This framework introduces a more general class of toric varieties than classical normal toric varieties, while having simpler combinatorial data compared to general non-normal toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is finitely generated.
  We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</description>

      <title>Steiner systems S(2,6,121/126), S(2,7,169) based on difference families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$, $S(2,7,169)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..11$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..6$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

      <title>Finite generation of split F-regular monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a submonoid of a free Abelian group of finite rank. We show that if $k$ is a field of prime characteristic such that the monoid $k$-algebra $k[S]$ is split $F$-regular, then $k[S]$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, or equivalently, that $S$ is a finitely generated monoid. Split $F$-regular rings are possibly non-Noetherian or non-$F$-finite rings that satisfy the defining property of strongly $F$-regular rings from the theories of tight closure and $F$-singularities. Our finite generation result provides evidence in favor of the conjecture that split $F$-regular rings in function fields over $k$ have to be Noetherian. The key tool is Diophantine approximation from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H^{ab}|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ and $H^{ab}$ are the abelianizations of $G$ and $H$ respectively, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,G_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>
