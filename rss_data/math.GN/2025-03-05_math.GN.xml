      <title>Posets uniquely determined by its compact saturated subsets</title>

Abstract: Inspired by Zhao and Xu's study on which a dcpo can be determined by its Scott closed subsets lattice, we further investigate whether a poset (or dcpo) $P$ is able to be determined by the family $\mathcal Q(P)$ of its Scott compact saturated subsets, in the sense that the isomorphism between $(\mathcal Q(P), \supseteq)$ and $(\mathcal Q(M), \supseteq)$ implies the isomorphism between $P$ and $M$ for any poset (or dcpo) $M$, in such case, $P$ is called $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique. Quasicontinuous domains are proved to be $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique posets and draw support from which, we provide a class of $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique dcpos. We also define a new kind of posets called $K_D$ and show that every co-sober $K_D$ poset is $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique. It even yields another kind of $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique dcpos. It is gratifying that weakly well-filtered co-sober posets are also $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique. At last, we distinguish among the conditions which make a poset (or dcpo) $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique from each other by some examples; meanwhile, it is confirmed that none of them except the property of being co-sober are necessary for a poset (or dcpo) to be $\mathcal Q_{\sigma}$-unique.</description>
