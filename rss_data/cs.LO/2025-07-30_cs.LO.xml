      <title>Semantic Numeration Systems as Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundational concepts of semantic numeration systems theory are briefly outlined. The action of cardinal semantic operators unfolds over a set of cardinal abstract entities belonging to the cardinal semantic multeity. The cardinal abstract object (CAO) formed by them in a certain connectivity topology is proposed to be considered as a linear discrete dynamical system with nonlinear control. Under the assumption of ideal observability, the CAO state equations are provided for both stationary and non-stationary cases. The fundamental role of the configuration matrix, which combines information about the types of cardinal semantic operators in the CAO, their parameters and topology of connectivity, is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Tree-Shaped Tableau for Checking the Satisfiability of Signal Temporal Logic with Bounded Temporal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a widely recognized formal specification language to express rigorous temporal requirements on mixed analog signals produced by cyber-physical systems (CPS). A relevant problem in CPS design is how to efficiently and automatically check whether a set of STL requirements is logically consistent. This problem reduces to solving the STL satisfiability problem, which is decidable when we assume that our system operates in discrete time steps dictated by an embedded system's clock.
  This paper introduces a novel tree-shaped, one-pass tableau method for satisfiability checking of discrete-time STL with bounded temporal operators. Originally designed to prove the consistency of a given set of STL requirements, this method has a wide range of applications beyond consistency checking. These include synthesizing example signals that satisfy the given requirements, as well as verifying or refuting the equivalence and implications of STL formulas.
  Our tableau exploits redundancy arising from large time intervals in STL formulas to speed up satisfiability checking, and can also be employed to check Mission-Time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL) satisfiability. We compare our tableau with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and First-Order Logic encodings from the literature on a benchmark suite, partly collected from the literature, and partly provided by an industrial partner. Our experiments show that, in many cases, our tableau outperforms state-of-the-art encodings.</description>

      <title>The Shape of $\mathcal{EL}$ Proofs: A Tale of Three Calculi (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consequence-based reasoning can be used to construct proofs that explain entailments of description logic (DL) ontologies. In the literature, one can find multiple consequence-based calculi for reasoning in the $\mathcal{EL}$ family of DLs, each of which gives rise to proofs of different shapes. Here, we study three such calculi and the proofs they produce on a benchmark based on the OWL Reasoner Evaluation. The calculi are implemented using a translation into existential rules with stratified negation, which had already been demonstrated to be effective for the calculus of the ELK reasoner. We then use the rule engine NEMO to evaluate the rules and obtain traces of the rule execution. After translating these traces back into DL proofs, we compare them on several metrics that reflect different aspects of their complexity.</description>

      <title>Why not? Developing ABox Abduction beyond Repairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abduction is the task of computing a sufficient extension of a knowledge base (KB) that entails a conclusion not entailed by the original KB. It serves to compute explanations, or hypotheses, for such missing entailments. While this task has been intensively investigated for perfect data and under classical semantics, less is known about abduction when erroneous data results in inconsistent KBs. In this paper we define a suitable notion of abduction under repair semantics, and propose a set of minimality criteria that guides abduction towards `useful' hypotheses. We provide initial complexity results on deciding existence of and verifying abductive solutions with these criteria, under different repair semantics and for the description logics DL-Lite and EL_bot.</description>

      <title>The interdefinability of expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. While the classical model-checking algorithm for full HyperLTL is automata-theoretic, more recently, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment has been presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, which features arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions and can express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>

      <title>Games on Graphs: From Logic and Automata to Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this book is to give a comprehensive presentation of the research field concerned with infinite duration games on graphs. Historically, these game models appeared in the study of automata and logic, and they later became important for program verification and synthesis. They have many more applications, in particular some of the models investigated in this book were introduced and studied in neighbouring research communities such as optimisation, reinforcement learning, model theory, and set theory.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models.</description>
