      <title>Dynamical Spectral Weight Transfer in the Orbital HK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute explicitly the low-energy spectral weight (LESW) in the lower Hubbard band using the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto (OHK) model. We show that the dynamical mixing enters the LESW with a universal slope independent of the number of orbitals. This independence on orbital number corroborates the rapid convergence of the OHK model to the Hubbard model. As a result, OHK is an effective simulator of Hubbard physics.</description>

      <title>Understanding the microscopic origin of the magnetic interactions in CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the on-going discussion on the nature of magnetism in the quantum Ising chain CoNb$_2$O$_6$, we present a first-principles-based analysis of its exchange interactions by applying an \textit{ab initio} approach with additional modelling that accounts for various drawbacks of a purely density functional theory ansatz. With this method we are able to extract and understand the origin of the magnetic couplings under inclusion of all symmetry-allowed terms, and to resolve the conflicting model descriptions in CoNb$_2$O$_6$. We find that the twisted Kitaev chain and the transverse-field ferromagnetic Ising chain views are mutually compatible, although additional off-diagonal exchanges are necessary to provide a complete picture. We show that the dominant exchange interaction is a ligand-centered exchange process - involving the $e_g$ electrons -, which is rendered anisotropic by the low-symmetry crystal fields environments in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, giving rise to the dominant Ising exchange, while the smaller bond-dependent anisotropies are found to originate from $d-d$ kinetic exchange processes involving the $t_{2g}$ electrons. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by comparing the predictions of the obtained low-energy model to measured THz and inelastic neutron scattering spectra.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit entangled moments and magnetic exchange interactions in cobalt-based honeycomb magnets BaCo$_2$($X$O$_4$)$_2$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-based honeycomb magnets have been actively studied recently for the potential realization of emergent quantum magnetism therein such as the Kitaev spin liquid. Here we employ density functional and dynamical mean-field theory methods to examine a family of the Kitaev magnet candidates BaCo$_2$($X$O$_4$)$_2$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb), where the compound with $X$ = Sb being not synthesized yet. Our study confirms the formation of Mott insulating phase and the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 spin moments at Co$^{2+}$ sites despite the presence of a sizable amount of trigonal crystal field in all three compounds. The pnictogen substitution from phosphorus to antimony significantly changes the in-plane lattice parameters and direct overlap integral between the neighboring Co ions, leading to the suppression of the Heisenberg interaction. More interestingly, the marginal antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor Kitaev term changes sign into a ferromagnetic one and becomes sizable at the $X$ = Sb limit. Our study suggests that the pnictogen substitution can be a viable route to continuously tune magnetic exchange interactions and to promote magnetic frustration for the realization of potential spin liquid phases in BaCo$_2$($X$O$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle and fully self-consistent GW methods: an unbiased analysis using Gaussian orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of various approximations to self-consistency in the GW method, including the one-shot G0W0 method, different quasiparticle self-consistency schemes, and the fully self-consistent GW (scGW) approach. To ensure an unbiased and equitable comparison, we have implemented all the schemes with the same underlying Matsubara formalism, while employing Gaussian orbitals to describe the system. Aiming to assess and compare different GW schemes, we analyze band gaps in semiconductors and insulators, as well as ionization potentials in molecules. Our findings reveal that for solids, the different self-consistency schemes perform very similarly. However, for molecules, full self-consistency outperforms all other approximations, i.e., the one-shot and quasiparticle self-consistency GW schemes. Our work highlights the importance of implementation details when comparing different GW methods. By employing state-of-the-art fully self-consistent, finite temperature GW calculations, we have successfully addressed discrepancies in the existing literature regarding its performance. Our results also indicate that when stringent thresholds are imposed, the scGW method consistently yields accurate results.</description>

      <title>Probing a Modified Luttinger Sum Rule in the Strongly Interacting 1D Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi surface reconstruction in cuprates can lead to an abrupt change in the Fermi momentum $k_F$ between different phases. This phenomenon remains subject of debate and is at the heart of an ongoing discussion about the nature of the metallic state in the pseudogap regime. Here we study a minimal model of a $k_F$ changing crossover in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, where a tuning of the onsite interaction leads to a crossover between a spin-$1/2$ Luttinger liquid with small Fermi momentum and a spinless chargon liquid with large Fermi momentum. We attribute this to an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry in the strongly correlated limit, which can be used to derive a modified Luttinger sum rule recovering the large Fermi momentum. We analyse Friedel oscillations at the edge of a system to directly probe the change of Fermi momentum at zero and non-zero temperature. This paves the way for a direct experimental observation of changes of the Fermi momentum using ultracold fermions in a quantum gas microscope, with possible extensions to higher dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Large magnetoresistance and first-order phase transition in antiferromagnetic single-crystalline EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a thorough investigation of the physical properties of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ single crystals using magnetization, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements. High-quality single crystals, which crystallize in a trigonal structure with space group $R\bar{3}m$, were grown using a conventional flux method. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements along different crystallographic orientations confirm two antiferromagnetic phase transitions around $T_{N1}$ = 10.5 K and $T_{N2}$ = 7.5 K. Isothermal magnetization data exhibit several metamagnetic transitions below these transition temperatures. Antiferromagnetic phase transitions in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ are further confirmed by two sharp peaks in the temperature-dependent heat capacity data at $T_{N1}$ and $T_{N2}$, which shift to the lower temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our systematic heat capacity measurements utilizing a long-pulse and single-slope analysis technique allow us to detect a first-order phase transition in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ at 7.5 K. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data also manifest two features associated with magnetic order. The magnetoresistance exhibits a broad hump due to the field-induced metamagnetic transition. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance keeps increasing without showing any tendency to saturate as the applied magnetic field increases, and it reaches $\sim$20000\% at 1.6 K and 60 T. At high magnetic fields, several magnetic quantum oscillations are observed, indicating a complex Fermi surface. A large negative magnetoresistance of about -55\% is also observed near $T_{N1}$. Moreover, the $H$-$T$ phase diagram constructed using magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetotransport data indicates complex magnetic behavior in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric in Step Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions has gained considerable interest with the discovery of moir\'e materials that exhibit bands flattened by quantum interference. The quantum metric, the symmetric part of the quantum geometric tensor, influences several observables, such as the dielectric constant, superfluid stiffness and optical spectral weight. However, a direct measurement of the metric itself has remained elusive so far. In linear response functions such as the conductivity, the matrix elements of the metric typically appear convoluted with energy prefactors, preventing finding an observable that is directly proportional to the total quantum metric. The only observable that may extract it is the integrated optical spectral weight weighted by the inverse frequency, a generalized sum rule known as the Souza-Wilkens-Martin (SWM) sum rule. However, the sum rule comes with experimental challenges, such as requiring a large spectrum of frequency resolution. In this work, we propose relaxation from constrained equilibrium as a method to directly measure the symmetric part of the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor (tQGT), which at $t=0$ is the quantum metric. Additionally, we comment on other geometric properties of insulators that are absent in the frequency expansions of conductivity in insulators but can, in principle, be revealed in step response.</description>

      <title>Using a Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm to Analyze the Critical Properties of the ANNNI Model Without Classical Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of the Anisotropic Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using a feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON). This approach allows us to compute both ground and excited states without relying on classical optimization methods. We study the quantum phase transitions using the Finite Size Scaling method, analyze correlation functions through spin correlations in the ground state, and examine magnetic structure by calculating structure factors via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Our results demonstrate the algorithm's capability to identify quantum phase transitions and efficiently map the ANNNI model's magnetic phases, establishing FALQON as a powerful tool to study complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We provide a comparative analysis of the results from these methods, where the features derived from the entanglement wedge and OTOC methods are equivalent. On the contrary, the butterfly velocity obtained from pole-skipping matches only when the critical exponent becomes unity, i.e., the usual asymptotically AdS black hole. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

      <title>Structure-Driven Prediction of Magnetic Order in Uranium Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning technologies has revolutionized the search and optimization of material properties. These algorithms often rely on theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), for data inputs and validation, which are not always effective for uranium-based materials due to their strong electron correlations. This study presents a computationally inexpensive machine learning approach, specifically a random forest classifier, to predict the magnetic ground states of uranium compounds using only structural inputs. Our model, trained on a curated dataset of experimentally-verified magnetic orders, achieves a mean accuracy of 60.2%, significantly outperforming random chance. By excluding computationally intensive DFT calculations, our method offers a faster and reliable alternative for discovering new materials with desirable magnetic properties, addressing the challenges posed by strong correlations in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Emergence of flat bands and ferromagnetic fluctuations via orbital-selective electron correlations in Mn-based kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome lattice has been actively studied for the possible realization of frustration-induced two-dimensional flat bands and a number of correlation-induced phases. Currently, the search for kagome systems with a nearly dispersionless flat band close to the Fermi level is ongoing. Here, by combining theoretical and experimental tools, we present Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ as a novel realization of correlation-induced almost-flat bands in the kagome lattice in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our magnetic susceptibility, $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance, transport, and optical conductivity measurements provide signatures of a correlated metallic phase with tantalizing ferromagnetic instability. Our dynamical mean-field calculations suggest that such ferromagnetic instability observed originates from the formation of nearly flat dispersions close to the Fermi level, where electron correlations induce strong orbital-selective renormalization and manifestation of the kagome-frustrated bands. In addition, a significant negative magnetoresistance signal is observed, which can be attributed to the suppression of flat-band-induced ferromagnetic fluctuation, which further supports the formation of flat bands in this compound. These findings broaden a new prospect to harness correlated topological phases via multiorbital correlations in 3$d$-based kagome systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate symmetry breaking in the Dirac fermion phase of the organic compound $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ under pressure, where BEDT-TTF denotes bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene. The exchange interaction resulting from inter-molecule Coulomb repulsion leads to broken time-reversal symmetry and particle-hole symmetry while preserving translational symmetry. The system breaks time-reversal symmetry by creating fluxes in the unit cell. This symmetry-broken state exhibits a large Nernst signal as well as thermopower. We compute the Nernst signal and thermopower, demonstrating their consistency with experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in low-dimensional systems and near quantum phase transitions have significant influences on material properties. Yet, it is difficult to experimentally gauge the strength and importance of quantum fluctuations. Here we provide a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of magnon excitations in Mott insulating cuprates. From the thin film of SrCuO$_2$, single- and bi-magnon dispersions are derived. Using an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian generated from the Hubbard model, we show that the single-magnon dispersion is only described satisfactorily when including significant quantum corrections stemming from magnon-magnon interactions. Comparative results on La$_2$CuO$_4$ indicate that quantum fluctuations are much stronger in SrCuO$_2$ suggesting closer proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Monte Carlo calculations reveal that other magnetic orders may compete with the antiferromagnetic N\'eel order as the ground state. Our results indicate that SrCuO$_2$ - due to strong quantum fluctuations - is a unique starting point for the exploration of novel magnetic ground states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Band Structure Dynamics in Bulk 1$T$-VSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex materials encompassing different phases of matter can display new photoinduced metastable states differing from those attainable under equilibrium conditions. These states can be realized when energy is injected in the material following a non-equilibrium pathway, unbalancing the unperturbed energy landscape of the material. Guided by the fact that photoemission experiments allow for detailed insights in the electronic band structure of ordered systems, here we study bulk 1T-VSe$_2$ in its metallic and charge-density-wave phase by time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. After near-infrared optical excitation, the system shows a net increase of the density of states in the energy range of the valence bands, in the vicinity of the Fermi level, lasting for several picoseconds. We discuss possible origins as band shifts or correlation effects on the basis of a band structure analysis. Our results uncover the possibility of altering the electronic band structure of bulk 1T-VSe$_2$ for low excitation fluences, contributing to the understanding of light-induced electronic states.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of local magnetism and superconductivity in the heavy-fermion CeRh$_2$As$_2$ revealed by $\mu$SR studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 0.3 K) of the heavy-fermion compound CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which undergoes an unusual field-induced transition to another high-field SC state, emerges from an unknown ordered state below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. While an electronic multipolar order of itinerant Ce-4$f$ states was proposed to account for the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase, the exact order parameter has not been known to date. Here, we report on muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies of the magnetic and SC properties in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ single crystals at low temperatures. We reveal a magnetic origin of the $T_\mathrm{o}$ order by identifying a spontaneous internal field below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. Furthermore, we find evidence of a microscopic coexistence of local magnetism with bulk superconductivity. Our findings open the possibility that the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase involves both dipole and higher order Ce-4$f$ moment degrees of freedom and accounts for the unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Protecting coherence from the environment via Stark many-body localization in a Quantum-Dot Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor platforms are emerging as a promising architecture for storing and processing quantum information, e.g., in quantum dot spin qubits. However, charge noise coming from interactions between the electrons is a major limiting factor, along with the scalability of many qubits, for a quantum computer. We show that a magnetic field gradient can be implemented in a semiconductor quantum dot array to induce a local quantum coherent dynamical $\ell-$bit exhibiting the potential to be used as logical qubits. These dynamical $\ell-$bits are responsible for the model being many-body localized. We show that these dynamical $\ell-$bits and the corresponding many-body localization are protected from all noises, including phonons, for sufficiently long times if electron-phonon interaction is not non-local. We further show the implementation of thermalization-based self-correcting logical gates. This thermalization-based error correction goes beyond the standard paradigm of decoherence-free and noiseless subsystems. Our work thus opens a new venue for passive quantum error correction in semiconductor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference between quasi-2D Fermi surface sheets in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UTe$_2$ is a spin-triplet superconductor candidate for which high quality samples with long mean free paths have recently become available, enabling quantum oscillation measurements to probe its Fermi surface and effective carrier masses. It has recently been reported that UTe$_2$ possesses a 3D Fermi surface component [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 036501 (2023)]. The distinction between 2D and 3D Fermi surface sections in triplet superconductors can have important implications regarding the topological properties of the superconductivity. Here we report the observation of oscillatory components in the magnetoconductance of UTe$_2$ at high magnetic fields. We find that these oscillations are well described by quantum interference between quasiparticles traversing semiclassical trajectories spanning magnetic breakdown networks. Our observations are consistent with a quasi-2D model of this material's Fermi surface based on prior dHvA-effect measurements. Our results strongly indicate that UTe$_2$ -- which exhibits a multitude of complex physical phenomena -- possesses a remarkably simple Fermi surface consisting exclusively of two quasi-2D cylindrical sections.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of Wiedemann-Franz law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Time crystal embodies chimeralike state in periodically driven quantum spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-chimeralike state, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spectrum of field theories with non-integer $O(N)$ symmetry from quantum evanescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify constraints in the energy spectra of quantum theories that have a global $O(N)$ symmetry, where $N$ is treated as a continuous parameter. We point out that a class of evanescent states fall out of the spectrum at integer values of $N$ in pairs, via an annihilation mechanism. This forces the energies of the states in such a pair to approach equality as $N$ approaches a certain integer, with both states disappearing at precisely integer $N$ and the point of would-be degeneracy. These constraints occur between different irreducible representations of the analytic continuation of $O(N)$ and hold non-perturbatively. We give examples in the spectra of the critical $O(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Universal low-temperature fluctuation of unconventional superconductors revealed: 'Smoking gun' leaves proper bosonic superfluidity the last theory standing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature thermal fluctuations offer an essential window in characterizing the true nature of a quantum state of matter, a quintessential example being Fermi liquid theory. Here, we examine the leading thermal fluctuation of the superfluid density across numerous families ranging from relatively conventional to highly unconventional superconductors (MgB$_2$, bismuthates, doped buckyballs, heavy fermions, UTe$_2$, doped SrTiO$_3$, Chevrel clusters, intermetallics, organic superconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides, ruthenates, iron-pnictides, cuprates, and kagome metals). Amazingly, in all of them an unprecedented universal $T^3$ depletion materializes in the low-temperature superfluid density, even in the believed-to-be-conventional MgB$_2$. This reveals a new quantum superfluid state of matter and requires a necessary change of paradigm in describing modern superconductors. We demonstrate that such unorthodox yet generic behavior can be described by a strictly Galilean consistent theory of bosonic superfluidity hosting a long-lived 'true condensate'.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and distinct density wave orders in correlated Kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders and the associated proposals to mimic unconventional high temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, magnetism and strong electronic correlations -- two essential ingredients for unconventional superconductivity, are absent in this V-based Kagome metal. CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly discovered Cr-based parallel of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, in which magnetism appears with charge density wave and superconductivity at different temperature and pressure regions. Enhanced electronic correlations are also suggested by theoretical proposals due to the calculated flat bands. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission measurements and first-principles calculations on this new material system. Electron energy bands and the associated orbitals are resolved. Flat bands are observed near the Fermi level. Doping dependent measurements on Cs(Cr$_x$V$_{1-x}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a gradually enhanced band renormalization from CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, accompanied by distinct spatial symmetry breaking states in the phase diagram.</description>
