      <title>Dual Laser Self-Injection Locking to a Micro Fabry-Perot for Low Phase Noise Millimeter-wave Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise and accessible millimeter-wave sources are critical for emergent telecommunications, radar and sensing applications. Current limitations to realizing low-noise, deployable millimeter-wave systems include size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, along with complex operating principles. In this paper we provide a compact photonic implementation for generating low phase noise millimeter-waves, which significantly simplifies the architecture and reduces the volume compared to alternative approaches. Two commercial diode lasers are self-injection-locked to a micro-Fabry-Perot cavity, and their heterodyne provides low phase noise millimeter waves reaching -148 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset on a 111.45 GHz carrier. Phase noise characterization at such levels and frequencies poses unique challenges, and we further highlight the capabilities of optically-based measurement techniques. Our approach to millimeter-wave generation can leverage advances in photonic integration for further miniaturization and packaging, thus providing a unique source of accessible, compact, and low-noise millimeter waves.</description>

      <title>Double-pass rotating z-cut quartz plate as a rapidly variable waveplate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a rapidly tunable waveplate based on a rotating z-cut quartz plate in a double-pass configuration. In contrast to previous single-pass implementations, where angular rotation of birefringent crystals causes significant beam path displacement, we show that the double-pass geometry effectively suppresses beam walk-off, reducing lateral shifts to below 10 $\mu$m, which is stable enough to have a fiber coupling. We present a full theoretical description of the polarization changes using Jones matrix calculations and verify it through polarization-resolved measurements. Additionally, the retardation is stable across a broad spectral range without requiring wavelength-specific optimization. When combined with a polarizing beam splitter, the system functions as a high-speed optical power modulator, achieving a dynamic power conversion in 1~ms with its contrast about 1000:1. This compact and robust design is particularly suited for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics experiments requiring rapid and precise control of light intensity.</description>

      <title>Partition laser assembling technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of micro/nanofabrication techniques with high throughput, efficiency, and flexibility is critical for fields like integrated photonics, biosensing, and medical diagnostics. This study presents Partition Laser Assembling (PLA), a novel laser technique for fabricating complex micro/nanostructures akin to puzzle pieces. By dividing the target patterns described by scalable vector graphics into partitions, any structures in each partition can be fabricated via structured lights as "light stamp" through spatial light modulation. Unlike traditional direct laser writing, PLA eliminates reliance on mechanical components, avoiding step-like artifacts and ensuring smoother fabrication of complex micro/nanostructures. By seamlessly assembling basic shapes, PLA achieves intricate structures like micro artworks and metalenses with unmatched precision and resolution. Leveraging two-photon fabrication, PLA guarantees high resolution and structural integrity, positioning it as a transformative tool for nanoscale 3D printing. With applications spanning research and industry, PLA paves the way for advanced optical devices, micro/nanofabrications, and next-gen manufacturing technologies.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity and high-resolution collaborative determination of birefringence coefficient using weak measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-sensitivity and high-resolution birefringence coefficient determination system for nm-level membrane films based on weak measurement, addressing the sensitivity-resolution trade-off. A tunable bandwidth light source is exploited to achieve complementary momentum (P-pointer) and intensity (I-pointer) measurements,enabling calibration-free operation across various bandwidths, and to realize high-precision phase difference monitoring of the measured membranes.This method maps the birefringence effect to a weak-value amplified signal of spectral shift and light intensity. The optimal resolution, achieved at a spectral width of 6 nm, is $1.5 \times 10^{-8}$ RIU, while the optimal sensitivity is achieved when the light source is a narrow-linewidth coherent laser, reaching 4710 mV/RIU. The linear range of the system covers a broad birefringence coefficient range for crystals,from $10^{-6}$ to 0.1. Furthermore, the auxiliary optical path eliminates substrate interference, achieving a detection limit of the birefringence coefficient as low as $10^{-8}$ RIU.This approach, characterized high precision, high sensitivity, and strong robustness, provides an effective solution for the detection of optical nano-thin membrane parameters.</description>

      <title>Inverse Drexhage effect in Epsilon-Near-Zero Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drexhage effect, caused by interference between a dipole and its image formed in a substrate, modifies the local density of optical states of quantum emitters which can either enhance or suppress their spontaneous emission rate depending on the dipole orientation and distance from the substrate. Here, we show that for an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) substrate, the observed orientation and distance dependence of the spontaneous emission rate is reversed compared to metals. This inverse Drexhage effect is studied for ideal ENZ and real ENZ substrates compared with ideal and real metallic substrates. ENZ metamaterials consisting of a subwavelength metal-dielectric stack are shown to exhibit the conventional Drexhage effects due to the large optical losses associated with these materials. Our results could find applications in quantum sensing, quantum information, and energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomically-Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanolasers: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications in precision acceleration and force sensing, as well as testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which often require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens enables stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for the collection of scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Positive-tone Nanolithography of Antimony Trisulfide with Femtosecond Laser Wet-etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony trisulfide ($Sb_{2}S_{3}$), as an emerging material for integrated photonic devices, has attracted significant attention due to its high index, low loss, and phase-changing property in the optical regime. However, conventional lithography-based fabrication methods involve complex, time-consuming, multistep processes, rendering the photonic application of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ challenging. Here, we demonstrate that positive-tone fabrication of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ nanostructures using wet-etch femtosecond laser processing, a straightforward technique for the engraving of micro- and nanoscale structures, can address major fabrication challenges. The patterning mechanism and factors influencing resolution of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ thin film structures deposited on quartz (transmissive) and gold (reflective) substrates are experimentally investigated and supported by theoretical modelling. Using this approach, the smallest linewidth fabricated is measured at 178 nm. Consequently, multiple test patterns are demonstrated showing versatile functionalities. Functional Fresnel Zone Plates (FZPs) with varying focal length are fabricated and characterized. This study provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ based integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Long-lived entanglement of a spin-qubit register in silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and a long-lived electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits long spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$ ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$ ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$ ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$ ms. Our results show that T centers can realize a long-lived multi-qubit register with an optical interface in silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Zernike system revisited: imaginary gauge and Higgs oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze that recently proposed clasical/quantum mechanical interpretation of Zernike system and establish its equivalence to the Higgs oscillator on sphere or pseudosphere (Lobachevsky plane). We show that the non-reality of the classical Zernike Hamiltonian is an insignificant artifact of imaginary gauge and can be eliminated with a canonical transformation. The quantum counterpart of this canonical transformation is a similarity transformation mapping the system to the quantum Higgs oscillator with integration measure depending on $\alpha,\beta$ parameters. When $\alpha=2 \beta$ it results in the Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle on (pseudo)sphere, while deviation from this point leads to a pseudo-Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15939v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Full dynamics of two-membrane cavity optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a two-membrane cavity optomechanical setup, two semi-transparent membranes placed within an optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity yield a nontrivial dependence of the frequency of a mode of the optical cavity on the membranes' positions, which is due to interference. However, the system dynamics is typically described by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift is expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this paper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the exact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two membranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this dynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear interaction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may significantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter regime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct and incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained mechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in the case of two-tone driving.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping ultrafast timing jitter in dispersion-managed 89 GHz frequency microcombs via self-heterodyne linear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser frequency microcombs provide equidistant coherent frequency markers over a broad spectrum, enabling new frontiers in chip-scale frequency metrology, laser spectroscopy, dense optical communications, precision distance metrology and astronomy. Here we demonstrate thermally stabilized frequency microcomb formation in dispersion-managed microresonators at the different mode-locking states featured with the negligible center frequency shift and broad frequency bandwidth. Subsequently, femtosecond timing jitter in the microcombs are characterized, supported by precision metrology on the timing phase, relative intensity noise and instantaneous linewidth. We contrast the fundamental noise for a range of 89 GHz microcomb states, from soliton crystals to multiple solitons and single-soliton regimes, determined by pump-resonance detuning. For the single-soliton state, we report a close-to-shot-noise-limited relative intensity noise of -153.2 dB/Hz and a quantum-noise-limited timing jitter power spectral density of 0.4 as2/Hz, at 100 kHz offset frequency. This is enabled by a self-heterodyne linear interferometer with 94.2 zs/Hz1/2 timing resolution, 50.6 mHz/Hz1/2 RF frequency resolution, and 6.7 uV/Hz frequency discrimination sensitivity. We achieve an integrated timing jitter at 1.7 fs, integrated from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. Measuring and understanding the fundamental noise parameters in these high-clock-rate frequency microcombs are essential to advance soliton physics and precision microwave-optical clockwork.</description>

      <title>Prospects of phase-adaptive cooling of levitated magnetic particles in a hollow-core photonic-crystal fibre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the relative phase between counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position allows dynamic phase adjustments that produce a Stokes-type cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

      <title>Structure-Adaptive Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic Band Gaps with TM-Polarized Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structure-adaptive topology optimization framework for engineering photonic band gaps with TM-polarized sources based on computation of the photonic density of states with a uniform source substituting for the standard Dirac delta function sources in formalisms analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration and to integration over a full Brillouin zone. We generalize the limiting uniform and Dirac delta function sources to more general collections of sources, such that the union of the sources in a given collection is hyperuniform. The uniform-source approach necessarily leads to the fastest computations. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that we can recover known two-dimensional photonic crystals for the TM polarization. A key advantage of our work is its ability to optimize for a specific midgap frequency and band gap in a structure-adaptive manner. Our work leverages the insight that the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic band gap must be sampled will lead to the observation of photonic-crystal structures when the $\Gamma$-point formalism for the uniform-source approach is employed. Additionally, our $\Gamma$-point and full Brillouin zone formalisms for the uniform-source approach inherently encourage binarized designs even in gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Customized, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser smoothing. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from a spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser smoothing processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.</description>

      <title>Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open frontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena connecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the interplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable and compact form.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spatially structured radiation generates second harmonic in a two-dimensional system even if the system is homogeneous and isotropic. The effect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured electromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second harmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type of structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the double frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied to twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the second harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic generation and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints imposed by crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence PSHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning PSHE. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>
