      <title>Estimating Task-based Performance Bounds for Accelerated MRI Image Reconstruction Methods by Use of Learned-Ideal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by the use of objective measures of image quality (IQ). The performance of the ideal observer (IO) acting on imaging measurements has long been advocated as a figure-of-merit to guide the optimization of imaging systems. For computed imaging systems, the performance of the IO acting on imaging measurements also sets an upper bound on task-performance that no image reconstruction method can transcend. As such, estimation of IO performance can provide valuable guidance when designing under-sampled data-acquisition techniques by enabling the identification of designs that will not permit the reconstruction of diagnostically inappropriate images for a specified task - no matter how advanced the reconstruction method is or how plausible the reconstructed images appear. The need for such analysis is urgent because of the substantial increase of medical device submissions on deep learning-based image reconstruction methods and the fact that they may produce clean images disguising the potential loss of diagnostic information when data is aggressively under-sampled. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) approximated IOs (CNN-IOs) was investigated for estimating the performance of data space IOs to establish task-based performance bounds for image reconstruction, under an X-ray computed tomographic (CT) context. In this work, the application of such data space CNN-IO analysis to multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems has been explored. This study utilized stylized multi-coil sensitivity encoding (SENSE) MRI systems and deep-generated stochastic brain models to demonstrate the approach. Signal-known-statistically and background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) binary signal detection tasks were selected to study the impact of different acceleration factors on the data space IO performance.</description>

      <title>A Vessel Bifurcation Landmark Pair Dataset for Abdominal CT Deformable Image Registration (DIR) Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is an enabling technology in many diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Despite this, DIR algorithms have limited clinical use, largely due to a lack of benchmark datasets for quality assurance during development. To support future algorithm development, here we introduce our first-of-its-kind abdominal CT DIR benchmark dataset, comprising large numbers of highly accurate landmark pairs on matching blood vessel bifurcations. Abdominal CT image pairs of 30 patients were acquired from several public repositories as well as the authors' institution with IRB approval. The two CTs of each pair were originally acquired for the same patient on different days. An image processing workflow was developed and applied to each image pair: 1) Abdominal organs were segmented with a deep learning model, and image intensity within organ masks was overwritten. 2) Matching image patches were manually identified between two CTs of each image pair 3) Vessel bifurcation landmarks were labeled on one image of each image patch pair. 4) Image patches were deformably registered, and landmarks were projected onto the second image. 5) Landmark pair locations were refined manually or with an automated process. This workflow resulted in 1895 total landmark pairs, or 63 per case on average. Estimates of the landmark pair accuracy using digital phantoms were 0.7+/-1.2mm. The data is published in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14362785. Instructions for use can be found at https://github.com/deshanyang/Abdominal-DIR-QA. This dataset is a first-of-its-kind for abdominal DIR validation. The number, accuracy, and distribution of landmark pairs will allow for robust validation of DIR algorithms with precision beyond what is currently available.</description>

      <title>Domain-conditioned and Temporal-guided Diffusion Modeling for Accelerated Dynamic MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a domain-conditioned and temporal-guided diffusion modeling method, termed dynamic Diffusion Modeling (dDiMo), for accelerated dynamic MRI reconstruction, enabling diffusion process to characterize spatiotemporal information for time-resolved multi-coil Cartesian and non-Cartesian data. Methods: The dDiMo framework integrates temporal information from time-resolved dimensions, allowing for the concurrent capture of intra-frame spatial features and inter-frame temporal dynamics in diffusion modeling. It employs additional spatiotemporal ($x$-$t$) and self-consistent frequency-temporal ($k$-$t$) priors to guide the diffusion process. This approach ensures precise temporal alignment and enhances the recovery of fine image details. To facilitate a smooth diffusion process, the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is utilized during the reverse diffusion steps. The proposed model was tested on two types of MRI data: Cartesian-acquired multi-coil cardiac MRI and Golden-Angle-Radial-acquired multi-coil free-breathing lung MRI, across various undersampling rates. Results: dDiMo achieved high-quality reconstructions at various acceleration factors, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and structural recovery compared to other competitive reconstruction methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This proposed diffusion framework exhibited robust performance in handling both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions, effectively reconstructing dynamic datasets in cardiac and lung MRI under different imaging conditions. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel diffusion modeling method for dynamic MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>PISCO: Self-Supervised k-Space Regularization for Improved Neural Implicit k-Space Representations of Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations (NIK) have shown promising results for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high temporal resolutions. Yet, reducing acquisition time, and thereby available training data, results in severe performance drops due to overfitting. To address this, we introduce a novel self-supervised k-space loss function $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{PISCO}$, applicable for regularization of NIK-based reconstructions. The proposed loss function is based on the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), enforcing a consistent global k-space neighborhood relationship without requiring additional data. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on static and dynamic MR reconstructions show that integrating PISCO significantly improves NIK representations. Particularly for high acceleration factors (R$\geq$54), NIK with PISCO achieves superior spatio-temporal reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the loss assumptions and stability shows PISCO's potential as versatile self-supervised k-space loss function for further applications and architectures.
