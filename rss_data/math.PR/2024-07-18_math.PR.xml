      <title>Finite de Finetti bounds in relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review old and recent finite de Finetti theorems in total variation distance and in relative entropy, and we highlight their connections with bounds on the difference between sampling with and without replacement. We also establish two new finite de Finetti theorems for exchangeable random vectors taking values in arbitrary spaces. These bounds are tight, and they are independent of the size and the dimension of the underlying space.</description>

      <title>Concentration and moment inequalities for heavy-tailed random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Fuk-Nagaev and Rosenthal-type inequalities for the sums of independent random matrices, focusing on the situation when the norms of the matrices possess finite moments of only low orders. Our bounds depend on the "intrinsic" dimensional characteristics such as the effective rank, as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the advantages of such results in several applications, including new moment inequalities for sample covariance matrices and the corresponding eigenvectors of heavy-tailed random vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that our techniques yield sharpened versions of the moment inequalities for empirical processes.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Super/Sub MOT using weak $L^1$ transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we revisit the weak optimal transport (WOT) problem, introduced by Gozlan, Roberto, Samson and Tetali (2017). We work on the real line, with barycentric cost functions, and as our first result give the following characterization of the set of optimal couplings for two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$: every optimizer couples the left tails of $\mu$ and $\nu$ using a submartingale, the right tails using a supermartingale, while the central region is coupled using a martingale.
  We then consider a constrained optimal transport problem, where admissible transport plans are only those that are optimal for the WOT problem with $L^1$ costs. The constrained problem generalizes the (sub/super-) martingale optimal transport problems, studied by Beiglb\"ock and Juillet (2016), and Nutz and Stebegg (2018) among others.
  Finally, we introduce a generalized \textit{shadow measure} and establish its connection to the WOT. This extends and generalizes the results obtained in (sub/super-) martingale settings.</description>

      <title>Expected Signature on a Riemannian Manifold and Its Geometric Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact Riemannian manifold $M,$ we show that the Riemannian distance function $d(x,y)$ can be explicitly reconstructed from suitable asymptotics of the expected signature of Brownian bridge from $x$ to $y$. In addition, by looking into the asymptotic expansion of the fourth level expected signature of the Brownian loop based at $x\in M$, one can explicitly reconstruct both intrinsic (Ricci curvature) and extrinsic (second fundamental form) curvature properties of $M$ at $x$. As independent interest, we also derive the intrinsic PDE for the expected Brownian signature dynamics on $M$ from the perspective of the Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin horizontal lifting.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the KPZ equation with non-integrable spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large scale fluctuations of the KPZ equation in dimensions $d \geq 3$ driven by Gaussian noise that is white in time Gaussian but features non-integrable spatial correlation with decay rate $\kappa \in (2, d)$ and a suitable limiting profile. We show that its scaling limit is described by the corresponding additive stochastic heat equation. In contrast to the case of compactly supported covariance, the noise in the stochastic heat equation retains spatial correlation with covariance $|x|^{-\kappa}$. Surprisingly, the noise driving the limiting equation turns out to be the scaling limit of the noise driving the KPZ equation so that, under a suitable coupling, one has convergence in probability, unlike in the case of integrable correlations where fluctuations are enhanced in the limit and convergence is necessarily weak.</description>

      <title>Entropy factorization via curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Poisson functionals and applications in continuum percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\eta$ be a Poisson random measure (defined on some Polish space), and let $F(\eta)$ be a square-integrable functional of $\eta$. In this paper we define and study a new notion of {\it spectral point process} associated with $F(\eta)$, and use such an object to study sharp noise instability and sensitivity properties of planar critical continuum percolation models under spatial birth-death (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) dynamics -- the notion of sharp noise instability being a natural strengthening of the absence of noise stability. The concept of spectral point process is defined by exploiting the Wiener-It\^o chaos expansion of $F$, and represents a natural continuum counterpart to the notion of {\it spectral sample}, as introduced in Garban, Pete and Schramm (2010), in the context of discrete percolation models. In the particular case where $\eta$ is a marked Poisson measure, we use Hoeffding-ANOVA decompositions to establish an explicit connection with the notion of {\it annealed spectral sample}, introduced in Vanneuville (2021) in the context of Poisson-Voronoi percolation. We also relate spectral processes with an appropriate notion of {\it pivotal processes}. As applications, we show sharp noise instability of crossing events in the critical Poisson Boolean model with unit-radius balls and, using an observation of Vanneuville, we obtain sharp noise sensitivity (as well as sharp noise instability) for crossing events in the Poisson Voronoi percolation model. As an important ingredient, we prove quasi-multiplicativity of the $4$-arm probabilities in the critical Poisson Boolean percolation model.</description>

      <title>Drilling holes in the Brownian disk: The Brownian annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the Brownian annulus based on removing a hull centered at the distinguished point in the free Brownian disk. We use this construction to prove that the Brownian annulus is the scaling limit of Boltzmann triangulations with two boundaries. We also prove that the space obtained by removing hulls centered at the two distinguished points of the Brownian sphere is a Brownian annulus. Our proofs rely on a detailed analysis of the peeling by layers algorithm for Boltzmann triangulations with a boundary.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional forest fires with boundary ignitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical Drossel-Schwabl forest fire process, vertices of a lattice become occupied at rate $1$, and they are hit by lightning at some tiny rate $\zeta &gt; 0$, which causes entire connected components to burn. In this paper, we study a variant where fires are coming from the boundary of the forest instead.
  In particular we prove that, for the case without recoveries where the forest is an $N \times N$ box in the triangular lattice, the probability that the center of the box gets burnt tends to $0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$ (but substantially slower than the one-arm probability of critical Bernoulli percolation). And, for the case where the forest is the upper-half plane, we show (still for the version without recoveries) that no infinite occupied cluster emerges. We also discuss analogs of some of these results for the corresponding models with recoveries, and explain how our results and proofs give valuable insight on a process considered earlier by Graf.</description>

      <title>Power-law hypothesis for PageRank on undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on observations in the web-graph, the power-law hypothesis states that PageRank has a power-law distribution with the same exponent as the in-degree. While this hypothesis has been analytically verified for many random graph models, such as directed configuration models and generalized random graphs, surprisingly it has recently been disproven for the directed preferential attachment model. In this paper, we prove that in undirected networks, the graph-normalized PageRank is always upper bounded by the degree. Furthermore, we prove that the corresponding (asymptotic) lower bound holds true under reasonable assumptions on the local weak limit, but not in general, and we provide a counterexample. Our result shows that PageRank always has a lighter tail than the degree, which contrasts the case of the directed preferential attachment model, where PageRank has a heavier tail instead. We end the paper with a discussion, where we extend our results to directed networks with a bounded ratio of in- and out-degrees, and reflect on our methods by contrasting the undirected and directed preferential attachment model.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion on the circle and multiradial SLE0+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main motivation of the present work is to investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\kappa \to 0+$ of multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLE$_\kappa$. We show that this process with the common parameterization satisfies a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) in the Hausdorff metric with non-negative rate function, the multiradial Loewner energy. We also characterize the large-time behavior of curves with finite energy and zero energy (whose driving functions correspond to the trigonometric Calogero-Moser system).
  The first half of this article is of independent interest regardless of SLE theory. It is devoted to proving a finite-time LDP for Dyson Brownian motion on the circle for a fixed number $n$ of particles as the coupling parameter $\beta=8/\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. To our knowledge, in the literature large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion has only been considered for fixed $\beta$ and as $n$ tends to $\infty$. While the non-Lipschitz drift precludes the application of the Freidlin-Wentzell theorem, we show that the rate function has the same form as in Freidlin-Wentzell theory for diffusions with uniformly Lipschitz drift.
  In the second half of this article, we turn to proving an LDP for multiradial SLE$_\kappa$. Here, the main technical difficulty is that the SLE$_\kappa$ curves have a common target point, preventing the usual configurational, or global, approach. Instead, we make careful use of the contraction principle from the LDP for Dyson Brownian motion (proven in the first part of the article), combined with topological results in Loewner theory: we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are always disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint. A key to this is obtained from a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group whose presentation graph is an Erdos-Renyi random graph on n vertices with edge probability p=p(n). We establish that p=1/\sqrt{n} is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random right-angled Coxeter group . As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree, even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of cycles of length $g$ passing through a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding reasonably tight lower bounds, which range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization with Heterogeneous Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decision problems under uncertainty, where the decision-maker has access to $K$ data sources that carry {\em biased} information about the underlying risk factors. The biases are measured by the mismatch between the risk factor distribution and the $K$ data-generating distributions with respect to an optimal transport (OT) distance. In this situation the decision-maker can exploit the information contained in the biased samples by solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, where the ambiguity set is defined as the intersection of $K$ OT neighborhoods, each of which is centered at the empirical distribution on the samples generated by a biased data source. We show that if the decision-maker has a prior belief about the biases, then the out-of-sample performance of the DRO solution can improve with $K$ -- irrespective of the magnitude of the biases. We also show that, under standard convexity assumptions, the proposed DRO problem is computationally tractable if either $K$ or the dimension of the risk factors is kept constant.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for quadratic hedging in incomplete jump market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning approach to study the minimal variance pricing and hedging problem in an incomplete jump diffusion market. It is based upon a rigorous stochastic calculus derivation of the optimal hedging portfolio, optimal option price, and the corresponding equivalent martingale measure through the means of the Stackelberg game approach. A deep learning algorithm based on the combination of the feedforward and LSTM neural networks is tested on three different market models, two of which are incomplete. In contrast, the complete market Black-Scholes model serves as a benchmark for the algorithm's performance. The results that indicate the algorithm's good performance are presented and discussed.
  In particular, we apply our results to the special incomplete market model studied by Merton and give a detailed comparison between our results based on the minimal variance principle and the results obtained by Merton based on a different pricing principle. Using deep learning, we find that the minimal variance principle leads to typically higher option prices than those deduced from the Merton principle. On the other hand, the minimal variance principle leads to lower losses than the Merton principle.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of infinitely many stationary solutions, as well as ergodic stationary solutions, to the three dimensional Navier--Stokes and Euler equations in both deterministic and stochastic settings, driven by additive noise. These solutions belong to the regularity class $C(\mathbb{R};H^{\vartheta})\cap C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{R};L^{2})$ for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ and satisfy the equations in an analytically weak sense. The solutions to the Euler equations are obtained as vanishing viscosity limits of stationary solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations. Furthermore, regardless of their construction, every stationary solution to the Euler equations within this regularity class, which satisfies a suitable moment bound, is a limit in law of stationary analytically weak solutions to Navier--Stokes equations with vanishing viscosities. Our results are based on a novel stochastic version of the convex integration method, which provides uniform moment bounds locally in the aforementioned function spaces.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of stochastic PDEs with long-range correlations</title>

Abstract: We study the large-scale dynamics of the solution to a nonlinear stochastic heat equation (SHE) in dimensions $d \geq 3$ with long-range dependence. This equation is driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise, which is white in time and coloured in space with non-integrable spatial covariance that decays at the rate of $|x|^{-\kappa}$ at infinity, where $\kappa \in (2, d)$. Inspired by recent studies on SHE and KPZ equations driven by noise with compactly supported spatial correlation, we demonstrate that the correlations persist in the large-scale limit. The fluctuations of the diffusively scaled solution converge to the solution of a stochastic heat equation with additive noise whose correlation is the Riesz kernel of degree $-\kappa$. Moreover, the fluctuations converge as a distribution-valued process in the optimal H\"older topologies.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and develop the concepts of Geometric Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (GBSDEs, for short) and two-driver BSDEs. We demonstrate their natural suitability for modeling continuous-time dynamic return risk measures. We characterize a broad spectrum of associated, auxiliary ordinary BSDEs with drivers exhibiting growth rates involving terms of the form $y|\ln(y)|+|z|^2/y$. We establish the existence, regularity, uniqueness, and stability of solutions to this rich class of ordinary BSDEs, considering both bounded and unbounded coefficients and terminal conditions. We exploit these results to obtain analogous results for the original two-driver BSDEs. Finally, we present a GBSDE framework for representing the dynamics of (robust) $L^{p}$-norms and related risk measures.</description>

      <title>Regularity of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in Rd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper entitled singularities of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in 2D, Bakhtin et al [5], consider a Markov process obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in the plane and characterize the singularities of the invariant density in terms of the switching and contraction rates. This paper considers a generalization of this model obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in Rd and provides sufficient conditions ensuring that the invariant distribution is absolutely continuous and has a Cr density. In dimension greater than 3 it provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully non-elliptic example of random switching for which quantitative conditions guaranteeing smoothness of the invariant density can be proved.</description>

      <title>Graph Expansions of Deep Neural Networks and their Universal Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation for spinal-structured trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.05099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of the problem of the estimation of birth distributions (BD) in multi-type Galton-Watson trees (MGW) with unobserved types. More precisely, we consider two-type MGW called spinal-structured trees. This kind of tree is characterized by a spine of special individuals whose BD $\nu$ is different from the other individuals in the tree (called normal whose BD is denoted $\mu$). In this work, we show that even in such a very structured two-type population, our ability to distinguish the two types and estimate $\mu$ and $\nu$ is constrained by a trade-off between the growth-rate of the population and the similarity of $\mu$ and $\nu$. Indeed, if the growth-rate is too large, large deviations events are likely to be observed in the sampling of the normal individuals preventing us to distinguish them from special ones. Roughly speaking, our approach succeeds if $r&lt;\mathfrak{D}(\mu,\nu)$ where $r$ is the exponential growth-rate of the population and $\mathfrak{D}$ is a divergence measuring the dissimilarity between $\mu$ and $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Measuring dependence between a scalar response and a functional covariate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the scope of a recently introduced dependence coefficient between a scalar response $Y$ and a multivariate covariate $X$ to the case where $X$ takes values in a general metric space. Particular attention is paid to the case where $X$ is a curve. While on the population level, this extension is straight forward, the asymptotic behavior of the estimator we consider is delicate. It crucially depends on the nearest neighbor structure of the infinite-dimensional covariate sample, where deterministic bounds on the degrees of the nearest neighbor graphs available in multivariate settings do no longer exist. The main contribution of this paper is to give some insight into this matter and to advise a way how to overcome the problem for our purposes. As an important application of our results, we consider an independence test.</description>
