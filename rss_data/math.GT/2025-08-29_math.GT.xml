      <title>Toward the profinite rigidity of hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note surveys recent progress toward the profinite rigidity of orientable finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Beginning in a brief review of some basic settings of profinite completion and rigidity of general groups, we state the complete results in profinite detection of 3-manifold decompositions and profinite rigidity or nonrigidity of other types of 3-manifolds, which reduce the problem to the hyperbolic case. Then we give some evidence to a positive answer and conclude some existing ideas toward the remained hyperbolic case. We also summarize the methods and techniques used in the process.</description>

      <title>Modular systoles are extremal for the crossing number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study crossing numbers for systoles of congruence surfaces. Taken as a family of curves on a family of surfaces, we show that the growth rate of their intersection is optimally small among all sets of curves of the same cardinality lying on the same topological surface.</description>

      <title>Geometric Kernels of Proper Maps Between Non-Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A map between connected $2$-manifolds has a geometric kernel if it sends a non-contractible simple loop to a null-homotopic loop. While every non-$\pi_1$-injective map between compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel, this generally fails for compact bordered or non-compact surfaces. In this paper, we use Brown's proper fundamental group to give a sufficient condition under which a degree-one map between non-compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel. Furthermore, we characterize conjugacy classes in the proper fundamental group and use this characterization to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of geometric kernels.</description>

      <title>$b^k$-algebroids and the variety of foliation jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and classify singular foliations of $b^{k+1}$-type, which formalize the properties of vector fields that are tangent to a submanifold $W \subset M$ to order $k$. When $W$ is a hypersurface, these structures are Lie algebroids generalizing the $b^{k+1}$-tangent bundles introduced by Scott.
  We prove that singular foliations of $b^{k+1}$-type are encoded by $k$-th order foliations: jets of distributions that are involutive up to order $k$, equivalently described as foliations on the $k$-th order neighborhood of $W$. Using this encoding, we construct topological groupoids of $k$-th order foliations and employ the holonomy invariant to show that these groupoids fiber over certain character stacks, yielding Riemann-Hilbert style classifications up to local isomorphism and isotopy.
  We also study the problem of extending a $k$-th order foliation to a $(k+1)$-st order foliation. We prove that this is obstructed by a characteristic class that arises as a section of a vector bundle over the relevant character stack.</description>

      <title>$C^0$-rigidity of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group of symplectic rational surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $C^0$-topology of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of positive symplectic rational surfaces. For all but a few exceptions, we prove that the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms forms a connected component in the $C^0$-topology. This provides the first nontrivial case in which the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is known to be $C^0$-closed inside the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms.
  The key to our approach is to build a bridge between techniques from symplectic mapping class groups and problems in $C^0$-symplectic topology. Via a careful adaptation of tools from $J$-holomorphic foliation and inflation, we establish the necessary $C^0$-distance estimates. We hope that this serves as an example of how these two subfields can interact fruitfully, and also propose several questions arising from this interplay.</description>

      <title>Cohomological nonvanishing for algebraic fundamental groups of ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ is a cocompact arithmetic lattice of simplest type with profinite completion $\widehat{\Gamma}$. This paper proves there is an open subgroup $\widehat{\Gamma}_0 \le \widehat{\Gamma}$ such that $H^j(\widehat{\Delta}, \mathbb{F}_p)$ is nontrivial for every open subgroup ${\widehat{\Delta} \le \widehat{\Gamma}_0}$, $j \le 2n$, and sufficiently large prime $p$. If $n \ge 2$, nonvanishing is new for all $j \ge 2$. Consequently, the virtual cohomological dimension of $\widehat{\Gamma}$ is at least $2n$, improving the previous lower bound of $1$. The proof shows there is a profinite fundamental class for the associated ball quotient and that its canonical class is profinite modulo torsion. For congruence $\Gamma$ and $j &lt; \frac{n+1}{2}$, restriction ${H^j(\widehat{\Gamma}, \mathbb{F}_p) \to H^j(\Gamma, \mathbb{F}_p)}$ is shown to be almost surjective in a precise sense; this is related to whether lattices in $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ are good in the sense of Serre, which is only known to hold for $n=1$.</description>

      <title>Complex hyperbolic 2-orbifolds with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each prime $p$, this paper constructs compact complex hyperbolic $2$-manifolds with an isometric action of $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ that is not free and has only isolated fixed points. The case $p = 2$ is special, and finding general examples for $p=2$ is related to whether or not complex hyperbolic lattices are conjugacy separable on torsion.</description>
