      <title>Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid state in Y-Kapellasite, Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_8$ by external pressure controlled frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic frustration is a key ingredient to prevent conventional ordering and, in combination with enhanced fluctuations in low dimensional quantum magnets, to stabilize the long sought spin liquid ground states. Most experimental spin liquid candidates inevitably deviate from perfectly frustrated models due to chemical and structural disorder, blurring the nature and origin of their ground states. Y-Kapellasite Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_{8}$ realizes a chemically clean system with an underlying kagome sub-lattice. The crystals undergo the theoretically predicted magnetic in-plane (1/3 1/3) order from a subtle release of frustration due to a distortion of the kagome system realised by displaced Y atoms. By studying the effect of pressure on the structure and optical phonons, we show that this distortion is partially lifted by compression towards a more isotropic model of interactions, in a gradual manner, without structural transition. Using $\mu$SR, we further show that the magnetic ground state is surprisingly sensitive to the applied pressure for a mineral, and that under a moderate 2 GPa pressure, the frustration increase is sufficient to induce a fluctuating ground state. Suppressing long-range magnetic order via frustration tuning with pressure, in an ultraclean material, establishes a major step towards realizing a well-controlled spin liquid ground state.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Thermal Paradox: Many-body localization or fractionalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal measurements of heat capacity and thermal conductivity in a wide range of insulators and superconductors exhibit a ``thermal paradox": a large linear specific heat reminiscent of neutral Fermi surfaces in samples that exhibit no corresponding linear temperature coefficient to the thermal conductivity. At first sight, these observations appear to support the formation of a continuum of thermally localized many-body excitations, a form of many-body localization that would be fascinating in its own right. Here, by mapping thermal conductivity measurements onto thermal RC circuits, we argue that the development of extremely long thermal relaxation times, a ``thermal bottleneck," is likely in systems with either many-body localization or neutral Fermi surfaces due to the large ratio between the electron and phonon specific heat capacities. We present a re-evaluation of thermal conductivity measurements in materials exhibiting a thermal paradox that can be used in future experiments to deliberate between these two exciting alternatives.</description>

      <title>Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phases and transitions of a triangular Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field, called the Hofstadter-Hubbard model. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy evaluation of non-thermal magnetic states beyond spin-wave theory: applications to higher-energy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split-CTMRG approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnon signatures of a metastable multiferroic state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials, particularly type-II multiferroics where ferroelectric polarizations arise from magnetic order, offer significant potential for the simultaneous control of magnetic and electric properties. However, it remains an open question as to how the multiferroic ground states are stabilized on the free-energy landscape in the presence of intricate competition between the magnetoelectric coupling and thermal fluctuations. In this work, by using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in combination with an applied magnetic field, photoexcitation, and single-shot detection, we reveal the spectroscopic signatures of a magnetic-field-induced metastable multiferroic state in a hexaferrite. This state remains robust until thermal influences cause the sample to revert to the original paraelectric state. Our findings shed light on the emergence of metastable multiferroicity and its interplay with thermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced moment freezing in NaFe$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the impact of magnetic impurity substitution on the quantum disordered magnetic ground state of NaRuO$_2$. Local $S=5/2$ moments are introduced into the frustrated triangular lattice of $J_{eff}=1/2$ Ru moments via Fe-substitution in NaFe$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_2$, and the evolution of the magnetic ground state is reported. Local spin freezing associated with conventional spin glass behavior is observed upon Fe substitution, marking an impurity-induced freezing of the primarily dynamic magnetic ground state in NaRuO$_2$. Furthermore, local Fe moments induce a Curie-Weiss magnetic behavior in the uniform magnetic susceptibility, and the local moment magnitude is best described by dynamic Ru moments polarized about impurity sites. Our results establish an impurity-doping phenomenology consistent with inherently dynamic moments in NaRuO$_2$ that are pinned by local magnetic impurities, similar to ``swiss cheese" models of impurity-substituted copper oxides.</description>

      <title>Gapping the spin-nodal planes of an anisotropic p-wave magnet to induce a large anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.</description>

      <title>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying orbital textures and their effects on the electronic properties of quantum materials is a critical element in developing orbitronic devices. However, orbital effects are often entangled with the spin degree of freedom, making it difficult to uniquely identify them in charge transport phenomena. Here, we present a combination of scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) current imaging, global transport measurements, and theoretical analysis, that reveals a direct contribution of orbital textures to the linear charge transport of 2D systems. Specifically, we show that in the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, which lacks both rotation and inversion symmetries, an anisotropic orbital Rashba coupling leads to conductivity anisotropy in zero magnetic field. We experimentally demonstrate this result by locally measuring the conductivity anisotropy, and correlating its appearance to the non-linear Hall effect, showing that the two phenomena have a common origin. Our results lay the foundations for an all--electrical probing of orbital currents in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

Abstract: Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state. Thus, our findings suggest new phase-sensitive experiments to characterize the Cooper pairing of new emerging superconductors such as the nickelates.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall response observed in a ferromagnetic oxide</title>

Abstract: Recent observation of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by magnetic field or spin magnetization lying in the Hall deflection plane has sparked interest in diverse mechanisms for inducing the Hall vector component perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Such off-diagonal coupling, which is strictly constrained by symmetry of the system, provides new degrees of freedom for engineering Hall responses. However, spontaneous response as extensively studied for out-of-plane AHE remains unexplored. Here we elucidate in-plane AHE in a typical ferromagnetic oxide SrRuO$_3$. The (111)-orientated ultrathin films with in-plane easy axes of spin magnetization exhibit spontaneous AHE at zero field, which is intrinsically coupled to the in-plane spin magnetization and controllable via its direction. Systematic measurements by varying azimuthal and polar field angles further reveal complex Hall responses shaped by higher-order terms allowed by trigonal distortion of the films. Our findings highlight versatile and controllable in-plane Hall responses with out-of-plane orbital ferromagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``local uncertainty relations'' in thermal many-body systems, from which fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds (e.g., those of the diffusion constant and viscosity) that are compared against experimental data.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, we incorporate boundary data for $T$-linear resistivity and bulk differential equations into a loss function. This approach allows us to derive dilaton potentials in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theories, capturing essential features of strange metals, such as $T$-linear resistivity and linear specific heat scaling. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Regardless of slope, dilaton potentials exhibit universal exponential growth at low temperatures, driving $T$-linear resistivity and matching infrared geometric analyses. At a specific slope, our method rediscovers the Gubser-Rocha model, a well-known holographic model of strange metals. Additionally, the robustness of $T$-linear resistivity at higher temperatures correlates with the asymptotic AdS behavior of the dilaton coupling to the Maxwell term. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding of strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced via non-linear phononics in bilayer van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Spin Liquid and Superconductivity emerging from Steady States and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, starting with a simple fermion wave function, the steady mixed state of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians, and the ensemble created by strong local measurement of fermion density without post-selection can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space -- the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a broadly used approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free Dirac fermion pure quantum state, the constructed mixed state corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid in the doubled Hilbert space. We also predict that for some initial fermion wave function, the mixed state created following the procedure described above is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the emergence of superconductivity in the doubled Hilbert space. We also design the experimental protocol to construct the desired physics of mixed states.</description>

      <title>High-field magnetic phase diagrams of the $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R=$~Y,~Gd$-$Lu) kagome metals are promising materials hosting flat electronic bands and Dirac points that interact with magnetism. The coupling between the two magnetic $R$ and Mn sublattices can drive complex magnetic states with potential consequences for spin and charge transport and other topological properties. Here, we use a detailed magnetic Hamiltonian to calculate and predict the magnetic phase diagrams for $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals within the mean-field approximation. These calculations reveal a variety of collinear, non-collinear, and non-coplanar phases that arise from competition between various interlayer magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies of the $R$ and Mn ions. We enumerate these phases and their magnetic space groups for future analysis of their impact on topological and trivial bands near the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of Neel order in the $S = 1/2$ square lattice Heisenberg model under fictitious magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Persistent Haldane Phase in Carbon Tetris Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of tetris chains, which are linear arrays of 4-site molecules that differ by their intermolecular hopping geometry. We investigate the fermionic symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase in these systems using Hubbard-type models. The topological phase diagrams can be understood via different competing limits and mechanisms: strong-coupling $U\gg t$, weak-coupling $U\ll t$, and the weak intermolecular hopping limit $t'\ll t$. Our particular focus is on two tetris chains that are of experimental relevance. First, we show that a Y-chain of coarse-grained nanographene molecules (triangulenes) is robustly in the Haldane phase in the whole $t'-U$ plane due to the cooperative nature of the three limits. Secondly, we study a near-homogeneous Y$^{\prime}$-chain that is closely related to the electronic model for poly(p-phenylene vinylene). In the latter case, the above mechanisms compete, but the Haldane phase manifests robustly and is stable when long-ranged Pariser-Parr-Popple interactions are added. The site-edged Hubbard ladder can also be viewed as a tetris chain, which gives a very general perspective on the emergence of its fermionic Haldane phase. Our numerical results are obtained by large-scale, SU(2)-symmetric tensor network calculations. We employ the density-matrix-renormalization group as well as the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) algorithms for finite and infinite systems, respectively. The numerics are supplemented by analytical calculations of the bandstructure winding number.</description>

Abstract: The ghost-Gutzwiller variational wavefunction within the Gutzwiller approximation is shown to stabilize a genuine paramagnetic Mott insulator in the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This phase hosts quasiparticles that are crucial to the paramagnetic response without showing up in the single-particle spectrum, and, as such, they can be legitimately regarded as an example of Anderson's spinons. We demonstrate that these spinons at the interface with a metal reacquire charge by proximity effect and thus reemerge in the spectrum as a heavy-fermion band.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted R\'enyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>
