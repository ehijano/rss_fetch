      <title>Asymptotic Plateau problem for $2$-convex hypersurface in $\mathbb{H}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of smooth complete $2$-convex hypersurface which satisfies prescribed curvature equation $(\kappa_1 + \kappa_2)(\kappa_1 + \kappa_3)(\kappa_2 + \kappa_3) = (2 \sigma)^3$ and has prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity of hyperbolic space of dimension 4, where $\sigma \in (0, 1)$ is a constant. We also prove the existence for $\sigma_k (\kappa_2 + \cdots + \kappa_n, \cdots, \kappa_1 + \cdots + \kappa_{n - 1}) = C_n^k (n - 1)^k \sigma^k$ with $k &lt; n$ in $\mathbb{H}^{n + 1}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Duality Between Constraints and Gauge Fields: Mirror Symmetry and Spencer Isomorphisms of Compatible Pairs on Principal Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mirror symmetry theory of Spencer cohomology within the geometric framework of constrained systems on principal bundles, revealing deep symmetric structures in constraint geometry. Based on compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ under strong transversality conditions, we construct a systematic family of mirror transformations: from basic sign mirrors $\lambda \mapsto -\lambda$ to general automorphism-induced mirrors $\lambda \mapsto (d\phi)^*(\lambda)$. Our core result proves that these transformations preserve all geometric properties of compatible pairs and induce natural isomorphisms between Spencer cohomology groups. This theory unifies constraint mechanics, gauge field theory, and differential topology, establishing a complete mathematical framework for symmetry analysis of constraint systems and revealing the special mirror structure of Spencer complexes in constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Constructing Two Metrics for Spencer Cohomology: Hodge Decomposition of Constrained Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a metric framework for Spencer complexes based on the geometric theory of compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ in principal bundle constraint systems, solving fundamental technical problems in computing Spencer cohomology of constraint systems. We develop two complementary and geometrically natural metric schemes: a tensor metric based on constraint strength weighting and an induced metric arising from principal bundle curvature geometry, both maintaining deep compatibility with the strong transversality structure of compatible pairs. Through establishing the corresponding Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, we rigorously prove that both metrics provide complete elliptic structures for Spencer complexes, thereby guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness and finite-dimensionality of Hodge decompositions. It reveals that the strong transversality condition of compatible pairs is not only a necessary property of constraint geometry, but also key to the elliptic regularity of Spencer operators, while the introduction of constraint strength functions and curvature weights provides natural weighting mechanisms for metric structures that coordinate with the intrinsic geometry of constraint systems. This theory tries to unify the differential geometric methods of constraint mechanics, cohomological analysis tools of gauge field theory, and classical techniques of Hodge theory in differential topology, establishing a mathematical foundation for understanding and computing topological invariants of complex constraint systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under a lower Ricci curvature bound and an upper diameter bound, a torus admits a finite-sheeted covering space with volume bounded from below and diameter bounded from above. This partially recovers a result of Kloeckner and Sabourau, whose original proof contains a serious gap that currently lacks a resolution.</description>

      <title>On Homogeneous CR Manifolds of Arbitrary Order of Levi Nondegeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper present homogeneous CR hypersurfaces satisfying the $CR$-invariant property of being $k$-nondegenerate for an arbitrary integer $k\geq 1$. The construction of such homogeneous manifolds are based on $CR$ algebras defined by irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. An explicit study of the iterated Levi forms with their respective kernels, along with the local model equation, is given.</description>

      <title>Stability and rigidity results of space-like hypersurface in the Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some rigidity theorems for space-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski space by using a Weinberger-type approach with P-functions and integral identities. Firstly, for space-like hypersurfaces $M$ represented as graphs $x_{n+1}=u(x)$ over domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the boundary $\partial M$ lies on a hyperplane intersecting with constant angles, then the hypersurface must be a part of hyperboloid. Secondly, for convex space-like hypersurfaces with boundaries on a hyperboloid or light cone, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the angle function between the normal vectors of the hypersurface and the hyperboloid (or the lightcone) on the boundary is constant, then such hypersurfaces must be a part of hyperboloid. These results significantly extend Gao's previous work presented in \cite{Gao1,Gao2}.
  Furthermore, we derive two fundamental integral identities for constant mean curvature (CMC) graphical hypersurfaces $x_{n+1}=u(x)$, $x\in\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, and the boundary lies on a hyperplane. As some applications: we obtain complete equivalence conditions for hyperboloid identification through curvature properties. We also
  establish a geometric stability estimate demonstrating that the square norm of the trace-free second fundamental form $\bar h$ of $M$ is quantitatively controlled by geometric quantities of $\partial\Omega$, as expressed by the inequality: $$ ||\bar h||_{L^2(\Omega)}\leq C(n,K)||H_{\partial\Omega}-H_0||_{L^1(\partial\Omega)}^{1/2}. $$
  Here, $H_{\partial\Omega}$ is the mean curvature of $\partial\Omega$, $H_0$ is some reference constant and $C$ is a constant.
  Finally, analogous estimates are established.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the gluing of two surfaces, where the gluing locus is assumed to be a curve. We consider a moving frame along the gluing locus, and define developable surfaces with respect to the frame. Considering geometric properties of these developable surfaces, we study the geometry of gluing two surfaces.</description>

      <title>Extension of algebroids Part I: The Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of two papers we will generalise the concept of extending a Lie algebroid by a Lie algebra bundle, leading to a notion of extending a Lie algebroid by another Lie algebroid whose orbits lie in the orbits of the former algebroid. The resulting Lie algebroid's anchor will be the sum of the two initial anchors such that the constructions will be similar to matched pairs of Lie algebroids, but with the major difference that we will allow curvatures. In this part of this series we will focus on the canonical construction making use of strict covariant adjustments, a generalisation of Maurer-Cartan forms in the context of gauge theories equipped with a Lie groupoid action instead of a Lie group action. That is, a Cartan connection with certain conditions on the curvature. The second paper will introduce and explain the obstruction of the extension provided here. Examples will include locally split structures as in Poisson geometry.
  As a side result we achieve strong hints towards a possible obstruction theory for certain Cartan connections on Lie algebroids, which will be related to the obstruction of (non-trivial) action algebroids; generalising the statement of the action algebroid structure induced by flat Cartan connections.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry on the $\ell^2$-Simplex via the $q$-Root Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{$\ell^p$-information geometry}, an infinite dimensional framework that shares key features with the geometry of the space of probability densities \( \mathrm{Dens}(M) \) on a closed manifold, while also incorporating aspects of measure-valued information geometry. We define the \emph{$\ell^2$-probability simplex} with a noncanonical differentiable structure induced via the \emph{$q$-root transform} from an open subset of the $\ell^p$-sphere. This structure renders the $q$-root map an \emph{isometry}, enabling the definition of \emph{Amari--\v{C}encov $\alpha$-connections} in this setting.
  We further construct \emph{gradient flows} with respect to the $\ell^2$ Fisher--Rao metric, which solve an infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem. These flows are intimately linked to an \emph{integrable Hamiltonian system} via a \emph{momentum map} arising from a Hamiltonian group action on the infinite-dimensional complex projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine V. Arnold's celebrated approach via the Euler-Arnold equation -- describing the geodesic flow on a Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric~\cite{Arnold66} -- with his formulation of the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field~\cite{ar61}. We introduce the \emph{magnetic Euler-Arnold equation}, which is the Eulerian form of the magnetic geodesic flow for an infinite-dimensional magnetic system on a Lie group endowed with a right-invariant metric and a right-invariant closed two-form serving as the magnetic field. As an illustration, we demonstrate that the Korteweg--de Vries equation, the generalized Camassa-Holm equation, the infinite conductivity equation, and the global quasi-geostrophic equations can all be interpreted as magnetic Euler-Arnold equations. In particular, we obtain both local and global well-posedness results for the magnetic Euler-Arnold equation associated with the global quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Lie point symmetries of the biharmonic heat equation on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uses Lie symmetry analysis to investigate the biharmonic heat equation on a generalized surface of revolution. We classify the Lie point symmetries associated with this equation, allowing for the identification of surfaces and the corresponding infinitesimal generators. In a significant move, we demonstrate that the biharmonic heat equation on a surface of revolution admits the same Lie symmetries as the harmonic heat equation on the same surface, highlighting a profound structural relationship between the two equations. Utilizing these symmetry groups, we derive similarity reductions that yield invariant forms of the equation and facilitate the construction of exact solutions. Finally, we provide certain examples illustrating precise solutions on the related surfaces with positive, negative, and zero Gaussian curvatures, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. This work contributes to the understanding of biharmonic heat equations on symmetric surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a rigidity theorem for annular sector-like domains in the setting of overdetermined elliptic problems on model Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, if such a domain admits a solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation satisfying both constant Dirichlet and constant Neumann boundary conditions, then the domain must be a spherical sector, and the solution must be radially symmetric. This result underscores the strong geometric constraints imposed by overdetermined boundary conditions, extending classical rigidity phenomena to this more general framework.</description>

      <title>Nakano-Griffiths inequality, holomorphic Morse inequalities, and extension theorems for $q$-concave domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a compact $n$-dimensional complex manifold endowed with a holomorphic line bundle that is semi-positive everywhere and positive at least at one point. Additionally, we have a smooth domain of this manifold whose Levi form has at least $n-q$ negative eigenvalues ($1\leq q\leq n-1$) on the boundary. We prove that every $\overline{\partial}_b$-closed $(0,\ell)$-form on the boundary with values in a holomorphic vector bundle admits a meromorphic extension for all $q\leq \ell\leq n-1$. This result is an application of holomorphic Morse inequalities on Levi $q$-concave domains and the Kohn-Rossi extension theorem. We propose a proof of the Morse inequalities by utilizing the spectral spaces of the Laplace operator with $\overline{\partial}$-Neumann boundary conditions. To accomplish this objective, we establish a general Nakano-Griffiths inequality with boundary conditions. This leads to a unified approach to holomorphic Morse inequalities and a geometric proof of vanishing theorems for $q$-concave and $q$-convex manifolds or domains.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>

      <title>SVarM: Linear Support Varifold Machines for Classification and Regression on Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>General monotone formula for homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation in the exterior domain and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an overdetermined problem for the $k$-Hessian equation ($1\leq k&lt;\frac n2$) in the exterior domain and prove the corresponding ball characterizations. Since that Weinberger type approach seems to fail to solve the problem, we give a new perspective to solve exterior overdetermined problem by combining two integral identities and geometric inequalities. In particular, when $k=1$, we give an alternative proof for Brandolini-Nitsch-Salani's results \cite{BNS}. Meanwhile, we establish general monotone formulas to derive geometric inequalities related to $k$-admissible solution $u$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is smooth, $k$-convex and star-shaped domain, which constructed by Ma-Zhang\cite{MZ} and Xiao\cite{xiao}.</description>

      <title>Solving Euclidean Problems by Isotropic Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems in Euclidean geometry, arising in computational design and fabrication, amount to a system of constraints, which is challenging to solve. We suggest a new general approach to the solution, which is to start with analogous problems in isotropic geometry. Isotropic geometry can be viewed as a structure-preserving simplification of Euclidean geometry. The solutions found in the isotropic case give insight and can initialize optimization algorithms to solve the original Euclidean problems. We illustrate this general approach with three examples: quad-mesh mechanisms, composite asymptotic-geodesic gridshells, and asymptotic gridshells with constant node angle.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Palais-Smale condition to Keller's $C_c^1$-functionals on Fr\'{e}chet spaces. Using this condition together with Ekeland's variational principle, we obtain some results regarding the existence of minima. In this setting, we prove that the Palais-Smale condition for functionals bounded below implies the coercivity.</description>

      <title>The Weyl tube theorem for K\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As sharpened in terms of Alesker's theory of valuations on manifolds, a classic theorem of Weyl asserts that the coefficients of the tube polynomial of an isometrically embedded riemannian manifold $M \hookrightarrow \mathbb R^n$ constitute a canonical finite dimensional subalgebra $\mathcal {L K}(M)$ of the algebra $\mathcal{V} (M)$ of all smooth valuations on $M$, isomorphic to the algebra of valuations on Euclidean space that are invariant under rigid motions. We construct an analogous, larger, canonical subalgebra $\mathcal{KLK}(M)\subset \mathcal{V}(M)$ for K\"ahler manifolds $M$: i) if $\dim M = n $, then $\mathcal{KLK}(M)\simeq \mathrm{Val}^{\mathrm{U}(n)}$, the algebra of valuations on $\mathbb{C}^n$ invariant under the holomorphic isometry group, and ii) if $M\hookrightarrow \tilde M$ is a K\"ahler embedding, then the restriction map $\mathcal{V}(\tilde M) \to \mathcal{V}(M)$ induces a surjection $\mathcal{KLK}(\tilde M)\to \mathcal{KLK}(M)$. This answers a question posed by Alesker in 2010 and gives a structural explanation for some previously known, but mysterious phenomena in hermitian integral geometry.</description>

      <title>On homogeneous plane waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane waves are a special class of Lorentzian spaces with a parallel null vector field. They are of great importance in Geometry (e.g. Lorentzian holonomy) and in Physics (General Relativity as well as alternative gravity theories). Our contribution in the present paper aims at a rigorous mathematical treatment focusing on completeness of Killing fields, and globality of coordinates. Equivalence of different approaches to plane waves is by no means easy to handle. We use here cohomogeneity one Heisenberg actions to introduce a point of view from which one can see plane waves as a deformation of Minkowski spacetime. We determine the identity component of the isometry group of a 1-connected non-flat homogeneous plane wave, which establishes a correspondence between these spaces and certain 1-parameter groups of automorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The extendibility of spacetimes (when incomplete) is a natural, important and delicate question. One of our main results is the proof of the $C^2$-inextendibility of non-flat homogeneous plane waves. We also prove that they are geodesically complete if and only if the null parallel vector field is preserved by the identity component of the isometry group. Finally, we show that a 1-connected homogeneous plane wave admits global Brinkmann coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the evolution of spectral curves in the Siegel Jacobi space through the Schrodinger equation constructed from a Kahler geometry induced on the lognormal statistical manifold via Dombrowski's construction. We introduce new holomorphic structures and show that the Hamiltonian vector field coincides with the fundamental vector field generated by holomorphic isometries. We construct the time dependent Schrodinger equation from this geometric setting and show that the associated energy is not constant, but varies with time. This work establishes a bridge between Kahler geometry, statistical models, and the formalism of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory for gravity coupled with scalar, SU$(n)$ and spinor fields on manifolds with null-boundary. We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional, in the sense of Gamma-convergence, based on the first variation ot the fractional Allen-Cahn energies, and we prove the corresponding $\Gamma$-limsup estimate. Our analysis is based on the expansion of the fractional Laplacian in Fermi coordinates and fine estimates on the decay of higher order derivatives of the one-dimensional nonlocal optimal profile. This result is the nonlocal counterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a phase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first variation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of a lattice Dirac operator known as the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at a finite mass, are proved to be equal.</description>
