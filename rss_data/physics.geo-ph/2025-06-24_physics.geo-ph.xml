      <title>Three-Dimensional Porous Structures of CO$_2$-Induced Salt Precipitation Sustaining Halite Self-Enhancing Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO$_2$ storage in saline aquifers presents challenges for injectivity and containment, with broader implications for soil salinization and cultural heritage preservation. This study utilizes time-lapse X-ray and spectral micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and deep learning-assisted image analysis to investigate halite crystallization and brine consumption in porous medium. We identified three-dimensional halite growth structures functioning as a secondary porous medium. Visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt-brine coexistence and halite precipitation revealed critical insights into the self-enhancing nature of salt growth. Expanding gas-liquid contact surfaces and initial crystal nucleation sites significantly enhanced evaporation and growth rates. Hydrophilic halite crystals attract brine films, establishing a feedback loop that perpetuates growth. The encapsulation of brine between grain surfaces and umbrella-like salt crusts was observed. Delineating the self-enhancing growth, including the role of capillary forces and surface-interface processes, is crucial for improving CO$_2$ injection efficiency and integrity, as well as for addressing environmental challenges related to soil salinization.</description>

      <title>Pix2Geomodel: A Next-Generation Reservoir Geomodeling with Property-to-Property Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies, porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over 19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74, FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA 0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling (Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science initiatives.</description>

      <title>A heterogeneous lithosphere on Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus is 95% the size of Earth and probably has a similar composition and internal energy, but the geodynamical mechanism governing its internal thermal evolution remains controversial. Much of the planet surface (77%) is covered by volcanic plains, characterized by basaltic flood lavas, some of which emanate from volcanoes whereas others have no identifiable sources. Here we show that the volcanic plains contain three provinces with statistically different properties. Apart from the plains around the Beta-Atla-Themis region characterized by a thick crust with a wide range of effective elastic lithospheric thickness (Te), the remaining volcanic plains (61% of the surface) display a dichotomous nature, with the northern plains showing a thinner lithosphere and twice the number of volcanoes per unit area compared to the southern plains. These global-scale differences imply a complex geodynamical regime, with large lateral variations in mechanical properties and/or geodynamical processes, which must be addressed by competing models of mantle convection and planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>FINCH EYE: The Optical and Optomechanical Design of a GRISM-based SWIR Hyperspectral Imaging Payload for a 3U CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crop residue is an important metric used for agricultural land-use monitoring and climate science research. Estimating crop residue coverage is essential to sustainable agricultural practices. The University of Toronto Aerospace Team is developing FINCH EYE, the optical payload for the upcoming FINCH 3U CubeSat, to measure crop residue cover. We conceived of a novel ultra-compact push-broom architecture with a volume phase-holographic grism dispersive element to keep the design compact and simplify the mechanical assembly. The FINCH EYE will image hyperspectral data from 900nm to 1700nm at 10nm spectral resolution, with a spatial resolution of 100m, and a SNR of 100. In this paper, we will describe the optical design of FINCH EYE, which consists of a commercial objective lens, an InGaAs camera, and a custom lens-grism-lens spectrograph. We will also describe the optomechanical housing, emphasizing design features that facilitate proper alignment during assembly.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions (IRFs). Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The presented methodology is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <title>The influence of interior structure and thermal state on impact melt generation upon large impacts onto terrestrial planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the melt production of planetary impacts as a function of planet size ($R/R_\mathrm{Earth}$=0.1-1.5), impactor size ($L$=1-1000 km), and core size ratio ($R_\mathrm{core}/R$=0.2-0.8) using a combination of parameterized convection models and fully dynamical 2D impact simulations. To this end, we introduce a new method to determine impact-induced melt volumes which we normalize by the impactor volume for better comparability. We find that this normalized melt production, or melting efficiency, is enhanced for large planets when struck by smaller impactors, while for small planets, melting efficiency is elevated when impacted by larger impactors. This diverging behavior can be explained by the thickness of the planets' thermal boundary layer and the shapes of their thermal and lithostatic pressure profiles. We also find that melting efficiency maxima are usually highest on Earth-size planets. We show that the melting efficiency is only affected by core size ratio for large cores and older planets, where melt production is decreased significantly compared to smaller core size ratios. Projecting the lunar impactor flux on the generic planets, we find that Moon-sized planets produce the most melt throughout their evolution, relative to planet volume. Contrary to previous scaling laws, our method accounts for melt production by decompression or plastic work in addition to shock melting. We find that traditional scaling laws underestimate melt production on length scales where variations in the target planets' lithology, temperature, and lithostatic pressure become significant. We propose empirical formulas to predict melt generation as a function of radial structure and thermal age.</description>

      <title>Deep Reparameterization for Full Waveform Inversion: Architecture Benchmarking, Robust Inversion, and Multiphysics Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution subsurface imaging technique, but its effectiveness is limited by challenges such as noise contamination, sparse acquisition, and artifacts from multiparameter coupling. To address these limitations, this study develops a deep reparameterized FWI (DR-FWI) framework, in which subsurface parameters are represented by a deep neural network. Instead of directly optimizing the parameters, DR-FWI optimizes the network weights to reconstruct them, thereby embedding structural priors and facilitating optimization. To provide benchmark guidelines for the design of DR-FWI, we conduct a comparative analysis of three representative architectures (U-Net, CNN, MLP) combined with two initial model embedding strategies: one pretraining the network to generate predefined initial models (pretraining-based), while the other directly adds network outputs to the initial models. Extensive ablation experiments show that combining CNN with pretraining-based initialization significantly enhances inversion accuracy, offering valuable insights into network design. To further understand the mechanism of DR-FWI, spectral bias analysis reveals that the network first captures low-frequency features and gradually reconstructs high-frequency details, enabling an adaptive multi-scale inversion strategy. Notably, the robustness of DR-FWI is validated under various noise levels and sparse acquisition scenarios, where its strong performance with limited shots and receivers demonstrates reduced reliance on dense observational data. Additionally, a backbone-branch structure is proposed to extend DR-FWI to multiparameter inversion, and its efficacy in mitigating cross-parameter interference is validated on a synthetic anomaly model and the Marmousi2 model. These results suggest a promising direction for joint inversion involving multiple parameters or multiphysics.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{Rescaled Rapidly Rotating incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations} (RRRiNSE). We solve the RRRiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$ and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RRRiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RRRiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is presented for linear, local, short-wavelength instabilities in swirling flows, in which axial shear, differential rotation, radial thermal stratification, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are all taken into account. A geometrical optics approach is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation, leading to a set of amplitude transport equations. From these, a dispersion relation is derived, capturing two distinct types of instability: a stationary centrifugal instability and an oscillatory, visco-diffusive McIntyre instability. Instability regions corresponding to different axial or azimuthal wavenumbers are found to possess envelopes in the plane of physical parameters, which are explicitly determined using the discriminants of polynomials. As these envelopes are shown to bound the union of instability regions associated with particular wavenumbers, it is concluded that the envelopes correspond to curves of critical values of physical parameters, thereby providing compact, closed-form criteria for the onset of instability. The derived analytical criteria are validated for swirling flows modelled by a cylindrical, differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria unify and extend, to viscous and thermodiffusive differentially heated swirling flows, the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling, differentially heated, visco-diffusive flows, thereby generalising the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>
