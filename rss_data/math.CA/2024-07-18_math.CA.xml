      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities on the Hamming cube near the critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality on the Hamming cube for exponents $\beta\ge 0.50057$ is proved, achieving equality on any subcube. This was previously known for $\beta\ge \log_2(3/2)\approx 0.585$. Improved bounds are also obtained at the critical exponent $\beta=0.5$, including a bound that is asymptotically sharp for small subsets. A key ingredient is a new Bellman-type function involving the Gaussian isoperimetric profile which appears to be a good approximation of the true envelope function. Verification uses computer-assisted proofs and interval arithmetic. Applications include progress towards a conjecture of Kahn and Park as well as sharp Poincar\'e inequalities for Boolean-valued functions near $L^1$.</description>

      <title>Topological complexity of ideal limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on the nonnegative integers $\omega$ and a Polish space $X$, let $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ be the family of subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S$ is the set of $\mathcal{I}$-limit points of some sequence taking values in $X$. First, we show that $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ may attain arbitrarily large Borel complexity. Second, we prove that if $\mathcal{I}$ is a $G_{\delta\sigma}$-ideal then all elements of $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ are closed. Third, we show that if $\mathcal{I}$ is a simply coanalytic ideal and $X$ is first countable, then every element of $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ is simply analytic. Lastly, we studied certain structural properties and the topological complexity of minimal ideals $\mathcal{I}$ for which $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ contains a given set.</description>

      <title>A note on the logarithmically perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on $\mathbb{H^N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N}u+\lambda u +|u|^{p-1}u+\theta u \ln u^2 =0, \ \ \ \ u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N), \ u &gt; 0 \ \text{in} \ \mathbb{B}^N.
  \end{align*}
  and study the existence vs non-existence results. We show that whenever $\theta &gt;0,$ there exists an $H^1$-solution, while for $\theta &lt;0$, there does not exist a positive solution in a reasonably general class. Since the perturbation $ u \ln u^2$ changes sign, Pohozaev type identities do not yield any non-existence results. The main contribution of this article is obtaining an ``almost" precise lower asymptotic decay estimate on the positive solutions for $\theta &lt;0,$ culminating in proving their non-existence assertion.</description>

      <title>A sharp weighted Fourier extension estimate for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ based on circle tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply recent circle tangency estimates due to Pramanik--Yang--Zahl to prove sharp weighted Fourier extension estimates for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $1$-dimensional weights. The idea of using circle tangency estimates to study Fourier extension of the cone is originally due to Tom Wolff, who used it in part to prove the first decoupling estimates. We make an improvement to the best known Mizohata--Takeuchi-type estimates for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the $1$-dimensional weights as a corollary of our main theorem, where the previously best known bound follows as a corollary of refined decoupling estimates.</description>

      <title>On the Smoothness of Zero-Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note investigates the regularity of zero-extensions of $L^p$ functions from bounded domains. Simple examples show the possibility of a loss in smoothness and our goal is to quantify this loss more generally.
  For the unit cube $\mathcal{Q}=[0,1]^d$, one of our main results is a bound for the $L^p$ modulus of continuity of zero-extensions. Using this, we prove that nonconstant functions in the Besov space $B^\alpha_{p,q}(\mathcal{Q})$ have zero-extensions in $B^\beta_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $\beta=\frac\alpha{\alpha p+1}$ and $r=q(1+\alpha p)$. This seems to be new when $\frac1p\leq\alpha&lt;1$. The key idea behind the main estimate is to use piecewise constant approximation on dyadic subcubes. This technique can likely be sharpened, even for the unit cube, and extended to less regular domains.</description>

      <title>A simple range characterization for spherical mean transform in odd dimensions and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a novel and simple range description for the spherical mean transform of functions supported in the unit ball of an odd dimensional Euclidean space. The new description comprises a set of symmetry relations between the values of certain differential operators acting on the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function in the range of the transform. As a central part of the proof of our main result, we derive a remarkable cross product identity for the spherical Bessel functions of the first and second kind, which may be of independent interest in the theory of special functions. Finally, as one application of the range characterization, we construct an explicit counterexample proving that unique continuation type results cannot hold for the spherical mean transform in odd dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>A note on one sided extrapolation of compactness and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper one sided counterparts of compactness extrapolation results of Hyt\"onen and Lappas are provided. As a consequence of those results, compactness results for one sided singular integrals, commutators of one sided fractional integrals and a certain class of $L^{r}$-H\"ormander operators are provided. The results for commutators of $L^{r}$-H\"ormander operators seem new even in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Characterization of classical orthogonal polynomials in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family of polynomials in two variables, orthogonal with respect to a weight function, we prove under some conditions, equivalence between: the Matrix Pearson equation of the weight, the second order linear partial differential equation, the orthogonality of the gradients, the Matrix Rodrigues formula involving tensor product of Matrices, and the so-called first structure relation. We then propose a definition of classical orthogonal polynomials in two variables.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, it was recently known that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-bounds of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not for any $3 \le p \le \infty$.
  In the third kind resonance case, we still show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generally unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. However, it can be also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ remain bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has a zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonance and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$.
  These results precisely describle all $L^p$-bounds of the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some exceptions of the endpoint cases for $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. As a result, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>
