      <title>Monster radio jet (&gt;66 kpc) observed in quasar at z$\sim$5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a large extended radio jet associated with the extremely radio-loud quasar J1601+3102 at $z\sim5$ from sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the LOFAR International Telescope. These large radio lobes have been argued to remain elusive at $z&gt;4$ due to energy losses in the synchrotron emitting plasma as a result of scattering of the strong CMB at these high redshifts. Nonetheless, the 0.3" resolution radio image of J1601+3102 reveals a Northern and Southern radio lobe located at 9 and 57 kpc from the optical quasar, respectively. The measured jet size of 66 kpc makes J1601+3102 the largest extended radio jet at $z&gt;4$ to date. However, it is expected to have an even larger physical size in reality due to projection effects brought about by the viewing angle. Furthermore, we observe the rest-frame UV spectrum of J1601+3102 with Gemini/GNIRS to examine its black hole properties, which results in a mass of 4.5$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ with an Eddington luminosity ratio of 0.45. The BH mass is relatively low compared to the known high-$z$ quasar population, which suggests that a high BH mass is not strictly necessary to generate a powerful jet. This discovery of the first $\sim100$ kpc radio jet at $z&gt;4$ shows that these objects exist despite energy losses from Inverse Compton scattering and can put invaluable constraints on the formation of the first radio-loud sources in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Optical Extinction Law Depends on Magnetic Field Orientation: The $R_V$-$\psi$ Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For aspherical interstellar dust grains aligned with their short axes preferentially parallel to the local magnetic field, the amount of extinction per grain is larger when the magnetic field is along the line of sight and smaller when in the plane of the sky. To the extent that optical extinction arises from both aligned and unaligned grain populations with different extinction properties, changes in the magnetic field orientation induces changes in its wavelength dependence, parameterized by $R_V \equiv A_V/E(B-V)$. We demonstrate that the measured total and polarized extinction curves of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium imply $R_V$ varies from 3.21 when the magnetic field is along the line of sight ($\psi = 0$) to $R_V = 3.05$ when in the plane of the sky ($\psi = 90^\circ$). This effect could therefore account for much of the large-scale $R_V$ variation observed across the sky ($\sigma(R_V) \simeq 0.2$), particularly at high Galactic latitudes.</description>

      <title>Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.</description>

      <title>From larger-scale cold-gas angular-momentum environment to galaxy star-formation activeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the ambient large-scale cold-gas vorticity on the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of all central galaxies with stellar masses of $10.0&lt;\log\,M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}&lt;11.5$, using the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. The cold-gas vorticity defined and calculated for gas with $T_{\rm gas} &lt; 2\times 10^4 \mathrm{K}$ and on scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc can well describe the angular motion of the ambient cold gas. We find crucial evidence for a clear connection between the cold gas spin/vorticity and star formation activeness, in that at any given halo mass, galaxies that live in a higher cold-gas vorticity environment are generally less actively star forming, regardless of the large-scale environment type (filament or knot) the galaxy lives in, or it being star-forming or quenched. In particular, at any fixed halo mass scale, the environmental cold-gas vorticities of galaxies in filaments are generally higher than those of galaxies in knots, naturally explaining lower the sSFRs of filament galaxies than of knot galaxies. This large-scale cold-gas vorticity is also highly connected to the orbital angular momentum of environmental galaxies up to a distance of $\sim$ 500 kpcs, indicating their common origin and/or possible angular momentum inheritance/modulation from the latter to the former. The negative modulation by the environmental vorticity to galaxy star formation is only significantly observed for the cold gas, indicating the unique role of cold-gas angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Quasar Anomaly Detection (SQuAD) I: Rest-Frame UV Spectra from SDSS DR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of applying anomaly detection algorithms to a quasar spectroscopic sub-sample from the SDSS DR16 Quasar Catalog, covering the redshift range 1.88 &lt; z &lt; 2.47. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for dimensionality reduction of the quasar spectra, followed by hierarchical K-Means clustering in a 20-dimensional PCA eigenvector hyperspace. To prevent broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from being identified as the primary anomaly group, we conducted the analysis with and without them, comparing both datasets for a clearer identification of other anomalous quasar types. We identified 1,888 anomalous quasars, categorized into 10 broad groups. The anomalous groups include C IV Peakers-quasars with extremely strong and narrow C IV emission lines; Excess Si IV emitters-quasars where the Si IV line is as strong as the C IV line; and Si IV Deficient anomalies, which exhibit significantly weaker Si IV emission compared to typical quasars. The anomalous nature of these quasars is attributed to lower Eddington ratios for C IV Peakers, super-solar metallicity for Excess Si IV emitters, and sub-solar metallicity for Si IV Deficient anomalies. Additionally, we identified four groups of BAL anomalies: Blue BALs, Flat BALs, Reddened BALs, and FeLoBALs, distinguished primarily by the strength of reddening in these sources. Further, among the non-BAL quasars, we identified three types of reddened anomaly groups classified as heavily reddened, moderately reddened, and plateau-shaped spectrum quasars, each exhibiting varying degrees of reddening. The detected anomalies are presented as a value-added catalog.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering the Milky Way with orbit superposition approach and APOGEE data II. Chrono-chemo-kinematics of the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar disc is the dominant luminous component of the Milky Way (MW). Although our understanding of its structure is rapidly expanding due to advances in large-scale stellar surveys, our picture of the MW disc remains substantially obscured by selection functions and incomplete spatial coverage of observational data. In this work, we present the comprehensive chrono-chemo-kinematic structure of the MW disc, recovered using a novel orbit superposition approach combined with data from APOGEE DR 17. We detect periodic azimuthal metallicity variations within 6-8 kpc with an amplitude of 0.05-0.1 dex peaking along the bar major axis. The radial metallicity profile of the MW also varies with azimuth, displaying a pattern typical among other disc galaxies: a decline outside the solar radius and an almost flat profile in the inner region, attributed to the presence of old, metal-poor high-{\alpha} populations, which comprise about 40% of the total stellar mass. The geometrically defined thick disc and the high-{\alpha} populations have comparable masses, with differences in their stellar population content, which we quantify using the reconstructed 3D MW structure. The well-known [{\alpha}/Fe]-bimodality in the MW disc, once weighted by stellar mass, is less pronounced at a given metallicity for the whole galaxy but distinctly visible in a narrow range of galactic radii (5-9 kpc), explaining its relative lack of prominence in external galaxies and galaxy formation simulations. Analysing a more evident double age-abundance sequence, we construct a scenario for the MW disc formation, advocating for an inner/outer disc dichotomy genetically linked to the MW's evolutionary stages. In this picture, the extended solar vicinity is a transition zone that shares chemical properties of both the inner (old age-metallicity sequence) and outer discs (young age-metallicity sequence).</description>

      <title>Galaxy formation physics behind bar formation: View from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies with a prominent disc component and a strong bar in their centre, based on a subsample of barred galaxies from the TNG50 magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We modify the physical models that regulate star formation, namely, supernova feedback and black hole quasar feedback, to examine how they affect the disc and bar formation. We find that the morphology remains consistent in all the galaxies that develop a massive stellar disc ($&gt;10^{10}\Msun$), which is dominant in comparison with the bulge mass. The black hole quasar feedback models used in this work do not affect bar formation, although they can affect the properties of the bar. The energy released by the supernovae causes a delay in the time of bar formation and, in models with strong feedback, stops bar formation. This could be understood since supernova feedback affects the assembly of the disc and bulge and their structural properties, such as the mass content, size, and radial velocity dispersion. We compared our predictions to three bar instability criteria proposed in the literature. We find that galaxies with varying supernovae and black hole quasar feedback satisfy these criteria at the moment of bar formation, except in extreme cases where the galaxy does not have or has weak supernova feedback, where for some galaxies, they fail to predict the existence (or no existence) of bars. Our findings provide insights into the physical process behind bar formation while putting constraints on the analytic prescriptions that predict bar formation.</description>

      <title>Partial Alignment of Astrometric Position Excursions of International Celestial Reference Frame Quasars with Radio Jet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Published analyses of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data for the sources included in the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) catalog have revealed object-specific, excess astrometric variability and quasi-coherent trajectories as functions of time. A fraction of these sources show markedly elongated distributions of positions on the sky measured with diurnal observations. Here we apply a novel statistical and data-processing method to the diurnal position measurements stretching over 40 years to quantify the degree of elongation and its position angle, for each source with more than 200 data points. We find that 49\% of the examined sources have distribution elongations in excess of 1.3. Robust uncertainties of the directions of maximal astrometric dispersion are computed by the bootstrapping method, and the results are compared with a larger catalog of radio jet directions by Plavin et al. 2022. Nearly one-half of the sources with smaller position angle uncertainties are found to have astrometric position excursions from their mean positions aligned with the radio jet structures within $\pm 30\degr$.</description>

      <title>Simulating high-redshift galaxies: Enhancing UV luminosity with star formation efficiency and a top-heavy IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. These high-$z$ galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses $M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 10$. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100\% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Distribution of Globular Cluster Systems in Early Type Galaxies: Estimation Procedure and Catalog of Properties for Globular Cluster Systems Observed with Deep Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the spatial distribution of globular cluster (GC) systems of 118 nearby early-type galaxies in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and Mass Assembly of early-Type GaLAxies with their fine Structures (MATLAS) survey programs, which both used MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We describe the procedure used to select GC candidates and fit the spatial distributions of GCs to a two-dimensional S\'ersic function, which provides effective radii (half number radii) and S\'ersic indices, and estimate background contamination by adding a constant term to the S'ersic function. In cases where a neighboring galaxy affects the estimation of the GC spatial distribution in the target galaxy, we fit two 2D S\'ersic functions, simultaneously. We also investigate the color distributions of GCs in our sample by using Gaussian Mixture Modeling. For GC systems with bimodal color distributions, we divide the GCs into blue and red subgroups and fit their respective spatial distributions with S\'ersic functions. Finally, we measure the total number of GCs based on our fitted S\'ersic function, and calculate the GC specific frequency.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Mass-dependent Evolution of Transitional Dwarf Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the evolution of transitional dwarf galaxies, specifically dwarf lenticulars (dS0s) and early-type dwarfs with blue cores (ETdG(bc)s), driven by environmental processes in the Virgo cluster utilizing the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog. We investigated the morphological fraction and stellar mass of transitional dwarf galaxies in relation to the clustercentric distance, compared to dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) and dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs). We found that dS0s beyond 0.7R_vir exhibit a similar trend in the morphology-clustercentric distance relation to dEs, demonstrating a decreasing fraction with clustercentric distance, whereas ETdG(bc)s display an opposite trend to dS0s. The spatial distributions of transitional dwarf galaxies and dEs correlate with the mass, in which fractions of bright, massive galaxies increase towards the central region of the Virgo cluster. In the mass-clustercentric distance plane, dS0s exhibit a skewed distribution that favors more massive galaxies than dEs at a given clustercentric distance. In the projected phase-space diagram, dS0s are scarce in the stripped region, whereas ETdG(bc)s are absent in both the stripped and virialized regions. In addition, the dS0s in the virialized region are predominantly brighter and more massive than the dEs, indicating that the transformation of dS0s into dEs depends on the stellar mass. We propose that the majority of observed dS0s constitute a population that has settled into the Virgo cluster, whereas ETdG(bc)s represent a recently accreted population. We discuss the impact of ram pressure stripping effects on mass-dependent morphological evolution.</description>

      <title>Average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. From Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z&lt; 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Misty, patchy, and turbulent: constraining the cold circumgalactic medium with {\emph mCC}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the largest baryon reservoir around galaxies, but its extent, mass, and temperature distribution remain uncertain. We propose that cold gas in the CGM resides primarily in $\sim 100 \hbox{--} 10^4$ cloud complexes (CCs), each containing a mist of tiny cold cloudlets dispersed in a warm/hot medium ($\sim 10^5 \hbox{--} 10^6$~K). Modeling CCs as uniform and misty simplifies the calculation of observables like ion absorption columns compared to resolving tiny individual cloudlets. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore how CC properties affect the observed spread in column densities. A power-law distribution of CCs ($dN_{\rm CC}/dR \propto R^{-1.2}$) reproduces MgII equivalent width (EW) and column density distribution trends with impact parameter ($R_\perp$). We show that the area-averaged MgII column density, combined with the covering fraction of CCs, provides a robust proxy for estimating the cold CGM mass, independent of other model parameters. Modeling individual CCs demonstrates that turbulent broadening blends cloudlet absorption lines, allowing CCs to approximate the observational effects of their constituent cloudlets analytically. Direct simulations of cloudlets within multiple CCs confirm the computational challenges of fully resolving the mist-like structure. Comparing modeled MgII absorption with observations, we estimate the cold CGM mass of Milky Way-like galaxies to be $\sim 10^{10} \, M_\odot$, about $10\%$ of the total CGM mass. This work provides a practical framework for connecting CGM models with observations, shedding light on the cold gas distribution in galaxy halos and its role in the galactic baryon cycle.</description>

      <title>CASBI -- Chemical Abundance Simulation-Based Inference for Galactic Archeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve hierarchically through merging with lower-mass systems and the remnants of destroyed galaxies are a key indicator of the past assembly history of our Galaxy. However, accurately measuring the properties of the accreted galaxies and hence unraveling the Milky Way's (MW) formation history is a challenging task. Here we introduce CASBI (Chemical Abundance Simulation Based Inference), a novel inference pipeline for Galactic Archeology based on Simulation-based Inference methods. CASBI leverages on the fact that there is a well defined mass-metallicity relation for galaxies and performs inference of key galaxy properties based on multi-dimensional chemical abundances of stars in the stellar halo. Hence, we recast the problem of unraveling the merger history of the MW into a SBI problem to recover the properties of the building blocks (e.g. total stellar mass and infall time) using the multi-dimensional chemical abundances of stars in the stellar halo as observable. With CASBI we are able to recover the full posterior probability of properties of building blocks of Milky Way like galaxies. We highlight CASBI's potential by inferring posteriors for the stellar masses of completely phase mixed dwarf galaxies solely from the 2d-distributions of stellar abundance in the iron vs. oxygen plane and find accurate and precise inference results.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovery of a MIGHTEE Odd Radio Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a new Odd Radio Circle (ORC J0219--0505) in 1.2~GHz radio continuum data from the MIGHTEE survey taken with the MeerKAT telescope. The radio-bright host is a massive elliptical galaxy, which shows extended stellar structure, possibly tidal tails or shells, suggesting recent interactions or mergers. The radio ring has a diameter of 35", corresponding to 114~kpc at the host galaxy redshift of $z_{\rm spec} = 0.196$. This MIGHTEE ORC is a factor 3--5 smaller than previous ORCs with central elliptical galaxies. The discovery of this MIGHTEE ORC in a deep but relatively small-area radio survey implies that more ORCs will be found in deeper surveys. While the small numbers currently available are insufficient to estimate the flux density distribution, this is consistent with the simplest hypothesis that ORCs have a flux density distribution similar to that of the general population of extragalactic radio sources.</description>

      <title>A Shallow Slope for the Stellar Mass--Angular Momentum Relation of Star-Forming Galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the specific angular momentum $j_\star$ of 41 star-forming galaxies at $1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$. These measurements are based on radial profiles inferred from near-IR \textit{HST} photometry, along with multi-resolution emission-line kinematic modelling using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from KMOS, SINFONI, and OSIRIS. We identified 24 disks (disk fraction of $58.6\pm 7.7\%$) and used them to parametrize the $j_\star$ \textit{vs} stellar mass $M_\star$ relation (Fall relation) as $j_\star\propto M_\star^{\beta}$. We measure a power-law slope $\beta=0.25\pm0.15$, which deviates by approximately $3\sigma$ from the commonly adopted local value $\beta = 0.67$, indicating a statistically significant difference. We find that two key systematic effects could drive the steep slopes in previous high-redshift studies: first, including irregular (non-disk) systems due to limitations in spatial resolution and second, using the commonly used approximation $\tilde{j}_\star\approx k_n v_s r_\mathrm{eff}$, which depends on global unresolved quantities. In our sample, both effects lead to steeper slopes of $\beta=0.48\pm0.21$ and $\beta=0.61\pm0.21$, respectively. To understand the shallow slope, we discuss observational effects and systematic uncertainties and analyze the retention of $j_\star$ relative to the angular momentum of the halo $j_h$ (angular momentum retention factor $f_j =j_\star/j_h$). For the $M_\star$ range covered by the sample $9.5 &lt;\log_{10} (M_\star/M_\odot) &lt; 11.5$ (halo mass $11.5 &lt; \log_{10} (M_h/M_\odot) &lt; 14$), we find large $f_j$ values ($&gt;1$ in some cases) in low-mass haloes that decrease with increasing mass, suggesting a significant role of efficient angular momentum transport in these gas-rich systems, aided by the removal of low-$j_\star$ gas via feedback-driven outflows in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>Chemically Self-Consistent Modeling of the Globular Cluster NGC 2808 and its Effects on the Inferred Helium Abundance of Multiple Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helium abundances in the multiple populations that are now known to comprise all closely studied Milky Way globular clusters are often inferred by fitting isochrones generated from stellar evolutionary models to globular cluster photometry. It is therefore important to build stellar models that are chemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and opacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar models of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 2808 using MARCS model atmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS low-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC 2808 photometry using Fidanka , a new software tool that was developed to optimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis. Fidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of distinct populations that exist within a dataset and then fit isochrones to each population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm. Using Fidanka and F275W-F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in NGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by $15\pm3\%$. This is in agreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous work by Dotter et al. (2015) focused on NGC 6752, demonstrates that chemically self-consistent models of globular clusters do not significantly alter inferred helium abundances, and are therefore unlikely to be worth the significant additional time investment.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (&gt;100 parsecs) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The magnetised evolution of star-forming cores in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud interpreted using Histograms of Relative Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between B-field orientation and density structure in molecular clouds is often assessed using the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO). We perform a plane-of-the-sky geometrical analysis of projected B-fields, by interpreting HROs in dense, spheroidal, prestellar and protostellar cores. We use James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 850 $\mu$m polarisation maps and Herschel column density maps to study dense cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. We construct two-dimensional core models, assuming Plummer column density profiles and modelling both linear and hourglass B-fields. We find high-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal cores produce strong HRO signals, as measured using the shape parameter $\xi$. Cores with linear fields oriented $&lt; 45^{\circ}$ from their minor axis produce constant HROs with $-1 &lt; \xi &lt; 0$, indicating fields are preferentially parallel to column density gradients. Fields parallel to the core minor axis produce the most negative value of $\xi$. For low-aspect-ratio cores, $\xi \approx 0$ for linear fields. Hourglass fields produce a minimum in $\xi$ at intermediate densities in all cases, converging to the minor-axis-parallel linear field value at high and low column densities. We create HROs for six dense cores in Ophiuchus. $\rho$ Oph A and IRAS 16293 have high aspect ratios and preferentially negative HROs, consistent with moderately strong-field behaviour. $\rho$ Oph C, L1689A and L1689B have low aspect ratios, and $\xi \approx 0$. $\rho$ Oph B is too complex to be modelled using a simple spheroidal field geometry. We see no signature of hourglass fields, agreeing with previous findings that dense cores generally exhibit linear fields on these size scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study the structure and kinematics of HH flows. Herbig-Haro (HH) flows exhibit large variety of morphological and kinematical structures. Both proper motion (PM) and radial velocity investigations are essential to understand the physical nature of such structures. We investigate the kinematics and PM of spectrally separated structures in the PV Cep HH flow HH 215. We present the observational results obtained with a 6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO multi-mode focal reducer with scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the PV Cep region in H$\alpha$ and [SII] emission (2003 and 2020-2021) allowed us to study the morphology of HH 215 jet in detail and to measure the PM and the radial velocities for its inner structures. Already known emission knots in the HH 215 flow and new features were studied. Moreover, a newly-formed HH knot was revealed, presumably formed during the large maximum of PV Cep star in 1976-1977. We found the high-velocity inner channel in the HH 215 ionized outflow, oriented accordingly to the mean direction of the whole HH outflow and the axis of the symmetry of the reflection nebula. The HH-knots located along the axis of the high-velocity channel have a position angle coinciding with its axis (abut 325$^{\circ}$), however other ones have completely different value (about 25$^{\circ}$), which supports the idea that those knots are formed by oblique shocks. We derived the value of i $\approx$ 30$^{\circ}$$\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ for the inclination angle between the flow axis and the line of sight. The total length of HH 215 outflow should be about 0.2 pc, and the full length of the bipolar outflow from PV Cep (HH 315 + HH 215) can be estimated as 3.6 pc, assuming that it more or less keeps the same inclination angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the semiclassical energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino flavor vacuum fulfills the equation of state of dust and cold dark matter. We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes, and we demonstrate that, within the weak field approximation, the flavor vacuum contributes as a Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential. This corrected potential may account for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In this perspective, neutrino mixing could contribute to dark matter</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Physics in Binary Stars and Applications in Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability criteria of rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental in binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We built the adiabatic mass-loss model and systematically surveyed the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. Many studies indicate that new mass transfer stability thresholds play an essential role in the formation and properties of double compact object populations and the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources. For example, our studies show that the mass transfer in the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch stars and the massive stars can be more stable than previously believed. Consequently, detailed binary population synthesis studies, using updated unstable mass transfer criteria, predicate the non-conservative stable mass transfer may dominate the formation channel of double stellar-mass black holes and can explain the population of the large mass ratio double stellar-mass black holes. Using our updated mass transfer thresholds, binary population thesis studies by Li et al. show that Ge et al.'s results support the observational double white dwarfs merger rate distribution per Galaxy and the space density of double white dwarfs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of the $n \Sigma v$ approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In kinetic theory, the classic $n \Sigma v$ approach calculates the rate of particle interactions from local quantities: the number density of particles $n$, the cross-section $\Sigma$, and the average relative speed $v$. In stellar dynamics, this formula is often applied to problems in collisional (i.e. dense) environments such as globular and nuclear star clusters, where blue stragglers, tidal capture binaries, binary ionizations, and micro-tidal disruptions arise from rare close encounters. The local $n \Sigma v$ approach implicitly assumes the ergodic hypothesis, which is not well motivated for the densest star systems in the Universe. In the centers of globular and nuclear star clusters, orbits close into 1D ellipses because of the degeneracy of the potential (either Keplerian or harmonic). We find that the interaction rate in perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potentials is determined by a global quantity -- the number of orbital intersections -- and that this rate can be far lower or higher than the ergodic $n \Sigma v$ estimate. However, we find that in most astrophysical systems, deviations from a perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potential (due to e.g. granularity or extended mass) trigger sufficient orbital precession to recover the $n \Sigma v$ interaction rate. Astrophysically relevant failures of the $n \Sigma v$ approach only seem to occur for tightly bound stars orbiting intermediate-mass black holes, or for the high-mass end of collisional cascades in certain debris disks.</description>

      <title>Radio sources of the survey on the declination of the pulsar in Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of the analysis of 205 brightest sources ( $S&gt;15$ mJy), which were found in the sky survey at the declination of the pulsar in the Crab Nebula, are presented. The survey was conducted at a frequency of 4.7~GHz using a three-beam radiometer complex installed in the focus of the Western Sector of the RATAN-600 radio telescope in 2018-2019. Based on the measurements and data collected in the database of astrophysical catalogs CATS built radio spectra of objects. For a quarter of all detected sources, data at a frequency higher than 4~GHz were obtained for the first time, and for the rest, they were appended. The variability of radiation sources on the scales of the year, from days to months, was studied. The greatest change in the radio flux was found in the blazar B2~1324+22. The search for daily variability was carried out for 26 the brightest sources with an average value of $S_{4.7} \sim 250$ mJy. All sources are identified with objects from optical and infrared catalogs. Radio luminosity is calculated for 112 objects with a known redshift.</description>

      <title>Dimming events of evolved stars due to clouds of molecular gas. Scenarios based on 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dramatic dimming episode of the red supergiant Betelgeuse in 2019/2020, caused by a partial darkening of the stellar disk, has highlighted gaps in the understanding of the evolution of massive stars.
  We analyzed numerical models to investigate the processes behind the formation of dark surface patches and the associated reduction in the disk-integrated stellar light.
  With the CO5BOLD code, we performed global 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of evolved stars, including convection in the stellar interior, self-excited pulsations, and the resulting atmospheric dynamics with strong radiative shocks.
  We attribute dimming phenomena to obscuring clouds of cool gas in the lower atmosphere, forming according to three different scenarios. One process transports material outward in a strong shock, similar to what occurs in 1D simulations of radially pulsating AGB stars. Another mechanism is triggered by a large convective upflow structure, in combination with exceptionally strong radial pulsations. This induces Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing plumes of material to be sent outward into the atmosphere. The third and rarest scenario involves large-amplitude convective fluctuations, leading to enhanced flows in deep downdrafts, which rebound and send material outward. In all cases, the dense gas above the stellar surface cools and darkens rapidly in visible light. AGB stars show localized dark patches regularly during intermediate phases of their large-amplitude pulsations, while more massive stars will only intermittently form such patches during luminosity minima.
  The episodic levitation of dense gas clumps above the stellar surface, followed by the formation of complex molecules in the cooling gas and possibly dust grains at a later stage, can account for the dark patches and strong dimming events of supergiant stars such as Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to estimate background in astronomical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the true background in an astronomical image is fundamental to detecting faint sources. In a typical low-photon count astronomical image, such as in the far and near-ultraviolet wavelength range, conventional methods relying on the 3-sigma clipping and median or mode estimation often fail to capture the true background level accurately. As a consequence, differentiating true sources from noise peaks remains a challenging task. Additionally, in such images, effectively identifying and excluding faint sources during the background estimation process remains crucial, as undetected faint sources could contaminate the background. This results in overestimating the true background and obscuring the detection of very faint sources. To tackle this problem, we introduce a geometric approach based on the method of steepest descent to identify local minima in an astronomical image. The proposed algorithm based on the minima statistics effectively reduces the confusion between sources and background in the image; thereby ensuring a better background estimation and enhancing the reliability of faint source detection. Our algorithm performs well compared to conventional methods in estimating the background even in crowded field images. In low-photon count, less crowded images, our algorithm recovers the background within 10\%, while traditional methods drastically underestimate it by a few orders of magnitude. In crowded fields, the conventional methods overestimates the background by $\sim 200\%$ whereas our algorithm recovers the true background within $\sim 14\%$. We provide a simple prescription to create a background map using our algorithm and discuss its application in large astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

Abstract: Internal kinematics of galaxies, traced through the stellar rotation curve or two dimensional velocity map, carry important information on galactic structure and dark matter. With upcoming surveys, the velocity map may play a key role in the development of kinematic lensing as an astrophysical probe. We improve techniques for extracting velocity information from integral field spectroscopy at low signal-to-noise ($S/N$), without a template, and demonstrate substantial advantages over the standard Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF) approach. Robust rotation curves can be derived down to $S/N\approx 2$ using our method.</description>

      <title>Widespread rapid quenching at cosmic noon revealed by JWST deep spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies in the young universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 14 massive quiescent galaxies ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &gt; 10$) at $z\sim2$ selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec $R\sim1000$ spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: 1) Relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; 2) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); 3) Galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted $\rm Na\,I\,D$ absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multi-phase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=4-6$: $n=(1.5-6.0)\times10^{-5}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}$. The two old massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching ($z\gtrsim6$), possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at $z&gt;3$. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and weak H$\alpha$ emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.</description>

      <title>A comparison of pre-existing $\Lambda$CDM predictions with the abundance of {\it JWST} galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the {\it James Webb Space Telescope} have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, $z\gtrsim 12$, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made -- prior to the {\it JWST} observations -- for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, {\sc galform}, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a ``top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from {\it JWST} observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to $z=14$ and make further predictions for $z=16$. We find that below $z\sim 10$, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at $z\gtrsim12$ requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains at these very early times and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from $z=14$ to $z=0$ and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass $2.5\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The stellar masses of the descendants range from $3.2\times 10^{6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to $3.2\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at $z=14$, over half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Halfway to the Peak: The JWST MIRI 5.6 micron number counts and source population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of eight JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) 5.6 micron images with $5\,\sigma$ depths of ~0.1 uJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 square arcminutes. We compute the MIRI 5.6um number counts including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Compared to earlier published MIRI 5.6 um counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2 uJy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. (2018) model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the $z\sim0.5-2$, with a tail out to $z\sim5$. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses ($10^8-10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$) main sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that with ~2hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below $M^*$ at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to $z\sim5$. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6um (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon) which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discover 31 MIRI-bright sources not present in COSMOS2020. A cross-match with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10-20% of these are likely lower mass (M$_*\approx10^9$M$_{\odot}$), $z\sim1$ dusty galaxies. The rest (80--90%) are consistent with more massive but still very dusty galaxies at $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in the Epoch of Reionization I: A JWST Study of Pair Fractions, Merger Rates, and Stellar Mass Accretion Rates at $z = 4.5-11.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of $4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5$. We target galaxies with masses $\log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 8.0 - 10.0$, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 $\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to $z = 8$, reaching $0.211 \pm 0.065$, followed by a statistically flat evolution to $z = 11.5$. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to $z = 6$ and then stabilizes at a value of $\sim 6$ Gyr$^{-1}$ up to $z = 11.5$. We fit both a power-law and a power-law + exponential model to our pair fraction and merger rate redshift evolution, finding that the latter model describes the trends more accurately, particularly at $z = 8.0 - 11.5$. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of $2.77 \pm 0.99$ from redshift $z = 10.5$ to $z = 5.0$. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute $71 \pm 25\%$ as much to galaxy stellar mass increases as star formation from gas. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Witnessing the onset of Reionisation via Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at redshift 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Cosmic Reionisation commenced when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift $z = 14$, when the Universe was less than $300 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ old. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$), the principal hydrogen transition. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of a galaxy at redshift $z = 13.0$ that reveal a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly$\alpha$, in addition to a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of $\text{EW}_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} &gt; 40 \, \AA$ (rest frame), previously only seen at $z &lt; 9$ where the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes increasingly ionised. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly$\alpha$ emission indicates the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionising photons. This suggests massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus (AGN) have created an early reionised region to prevent complete extinction of Ly$\alpha$, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of Reionisation only $330 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) as a potentially significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: Scale and redshift variation of velocity and density distributions</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the scale and redshift variation of density and velocity distributions in self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow by a halo-based non-projection approach. All particles are divided into halo and out-of-halo particles for redshift variation of distributions. Without projecting particle fields onto a structured grid, the scale variation is analyzed by identifying all particle pairs on different scales $r$. We demonstrate that: i) Delaunay tessellation can be used to reconstruct the density field. The density correlation, spectrum, and dispersion functions were obtained, modeled, and compared with the N-body simulation; ii) the velocity distributions are symmetric on both small and large scales and are non-symmetric with a negative skewness on intermediate scales due to the inverse energy cascade at a constant rate $\varepsilon_u$; iii) On small scales, the even order moments of pairwise velocity $\Delta u_L$ follow a two-thirds law $\propto{(-\varepsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$, while the odd order moments follow a linear scaling $\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n+1}\rangle=(2n+1)\langle(\Delta u_L)^{2n}\rangle\langle\Delta u_L\rangle\propto{r}$; iv) The scale variation of the velocity distributions was studied for longitudinal velocities $u_L$ or $u_L^{'}$, pairwise velocity (velocity difference) $\Delta u_L$=$u_L^{'}$-$u_L$ and velocity sum $\Sigma u_L$=$u^{'}_L$+$u_L$. Fully developed velocity fields are never Gaussian on any scale, despite that they can initially be Gaussian; v) On small scales, $u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a $X$ distribution to maximize the system entropy; vi) On large scales, $\Delta u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modeled by a logistic or a $X$ distribution; vii) the redshift variation of the velocity distributions follows the evolution of the $X$ distribution involving a shape parameter $\alpha(z)$ decreasing with time.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>
