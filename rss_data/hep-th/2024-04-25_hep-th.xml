      <title>Holographic scattering and non-minimal RT surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the causal structure of the bulk AdS spacetime is tied to entanglement in the dual CFT. This relationship is captured by the connected wedge theorem, which states that a bulk scattering process implies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ entanglement between associated boundary subregions. In this paper, we study the connected wedge theorem in two asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes: the conical defect and BTZ black hole geometries. In these settings, we find that bulk scattering processes require not just large entanglement, but also additional restrictions related to candidate RT surfaces which are non-minimal. We argue these extra relationships imply a certain CFT entanglement structure involving internal degrees of freedom. Because bulk scattering relies on sub-AdS scale physics, this supports the idea that sub-AdS scale locality emerges from internal degrees of freedom. While the new restriction that we identify on non-minimal surfaces is stronger than the initial statement of the connected wedge theorem, we find that it is necessary but still not sufficient to imply bulk scattering in mixed states.</description>

      <title>On de Sitter vacua in O(d,d) invariant cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of de Sitter vacua in O(d,d) invariant cosmologies. Starting with a homogeneous and isotropic framework we examine conditions for the existence of such vacua, non-perturbative in \alpha' in both the string frame and the Einstein frame. We elucidate the nature of the instability in the string frame vacuum. For the Einstein frame, we demonstrate that the de Sitter vacuum cannot be eternal. We then extend our analysis to include Bianchi I universes where the O(d,d) symmetry includes scale factor exchange as well as scale factor duality. We show how the theory can be extended to the anisotropic case so that it admits de Sitter vacua, noting the crucial role played by the O(d,d) symmetry in satisfying any additional constraints.</description>

      <title>Axions in the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, which is motivated from Swampland principles and predicts a single micron scale extra dimension, suggests a consistent framework for the dark sector of the universe. We consider the implications of this scenario for the QCD axion. We find that in the scenario in which the axion is localized on the standard model brane (which we will argue is natural), a combination of theoretical (being bounded by the 5D Planck mass) and observational constraints forces it to have decay constant in a narrow range $f \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$ GeV. This corresponds to a mass for the QCD axion of $m_a \sim (1 - 10)$ meV. The axion mass surprisingly coincides with the mass scale for the dark energy, the dark matter tower, and the neutrinos. In this scenario axions are not expected to form a large fraction of the dark matter but nevertheless this range of axion parameters is accessible to observations in near future experiments.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$
with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <title>On the existence of thermodynamically stable asymptotically flat black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the quasilocal formalism of Brown and York, supplemented with counterterms, to investigate the thermodynamics of asymptotically flat black holes. We consider two families of exact regular black hole solutions, which are thermodynamically stable. The first one consists of four-dimensional static charged hairy black holes in extended supergravity. The second family consists of five-dimensional static charged black holes in Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity. Despite the fact that their characteristics are completely different, we found a striking similarity between their thermodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-gravitating solutions of 3-dimensional massive gravity coupled to Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge theory. Among these, there is a family of asymptotically Warped-Anti de Sitter black holes that come to generalize previous solutions found in the literature and studied in the context of WAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. We also present self-gravitating solutions to the 3-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, as well as other self-gravitating solutions in the presence of higher-curvature terms.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and space-time symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structure of the renormalization group in the renormalizable QFT theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the group formed by finite renormalizations as an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is demonstrated that for the finite renormalization of the gauge coupling constant its generators $\hat L_n$ with $n\ge 1$ satisfy the commutation relations of the Witt algebra and, therefore, form its subalgebra. The commutation relations are also written for the more general case when finite renormalizations are made for both the coupling constant and matter fields. We also construct the generator of the Abelian subgroup corresponding to the changes of the renormalization scale. The explicit expressions for the renormalization group generators are written in the case when they act on the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension. It is explained how the finite changes of these functions under the finite renormalizations can be obtained with the help of the exponential map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider two related problems, i.e. the description of geodesics and the calculation of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a flag manifold. We show that there exists a family of invariant metrics such that both problems can be solved simply and explicitly. In order to determine the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we construct natural, finite-dimensional approximations (of spin chain type) to the Hilbert space of functions on a flag manifold.</description>

      <title>Complexity Measure Diagnostics of Ergodic to Many-Body Localization Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new diagnostics of the transition between the ergodic and many-body localization phases, which are based on complexity measures defined via the probability distribution function of the Lanczos coefficients of the tri-diagonalized Hamiltonian. We use these complexity measures to analyze the power-law random banded matrix model as a function of the correlation strength and show that the moments and the entropy of the distribution diagnose the ergodic to many-body transition, as well as the distinctive feature of the phases concerning the memory of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship and Weak Gravity Conjectures in CFT Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing interplay between fundamental theoretical physics concepts within the context of charged black holes. Specifically, we focus on the consistency of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in the thermodynamics of conformal field theory (CFT), and restricted phase space (RPS) for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m black holes with a perfect fluid dark matter (RN-PFDM). The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in EPST, RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM $( \gamma )$ and the radius of AdS ($l$) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity with $( f(M_c, Q_c, r_c) = 0 )$. We conclude that the WGC is supported at the critical point of black holes, and the WCCC is also maintained, demonstrating the robustness of these conjectures within the critical ranges of black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Frozen stars: Black hole mimickers sourced by a string fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frozen star is a non-singular, ultracompact object that, to an external observer, looks exactly like a Schwarzschild black hole, but with a different interior geometry and matter composition. The frozen star needs to be sourced by an extremely anisotropic fluid, for which the sum of the radial pressure and energy density is either vanishing or perturbatively small. Here, we show that this matter can be identified with the string fluid resulting from the decay of an unstable $D$-brane or a brane-antibrane system at the end of open-string tachyon condensation. The string fluid corresponds to flux tubes emanating from the center and ending at the Schwarzschild radius of the star. The effective Lagrangian for this fluid can be recast into a Born-Infeld form. When the fluid Lagrangian is coupled to that of Einstein's Gravity, the static, spherically symmetric solutions of the equations of motion are shown to be the same as those describing the frozen star model. Frozen stars can therefore be viewed as gravitationally back-reacted BIons. The Born-Infeld Lagrangian provides a complete set of equations that describe the dynamics of the frozen star in a generic state, which is not necessarily static nor spherically symmetric. Additionally, this description provides a new physical perspective on the structure of the frozen star in terms of the corresponding electric fields and charges. The electric field is sourced by a point-like charge at the center of the star, while its outer layer is equal and oppositely charged. The electric force between the charges is offset because the mass of the star is fixed.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of symmetry descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many cases the symmetry structure of quantum field theories can be neatly encoded into their associated symmetry theory (SymTFT), a topological field theory in one dimension higher. For geometrically engineered QFTs in string theory this SymTFT has been argued to arise from the background geometry, essentially by integration of the topological sector of string theory on the horizon of the geometry transverse to the QFT locus. In this paper we clarify some subtle aspects of this proposal. We take a higher dimensional approach, where the ten dimensional string theory fields to be integrated arise as edge modes of a topological field theory in eleven dimensions. The resulting construction provides a SymTFT generalisation of the descent procedure for anomalies.</description>

      <title>Motivic classes of irregular Higgs bundles and irregular connections on a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal D$ be an effective divisor on $X$. We calculate motivic classes of various moduli stacks of parabolic vector bundles with irregular connections on $X$ and of irregular parabolic Higgs bundles on $X$ with poles bounded by $\mathcal D$ and with fully or partially fixed formal normal forms. Along the way, we obtain several results about irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. In particular, we give a criterion for the existence of a connection on a higher level parabolic bundle and also develop homological algebra for irregular connections and irregular parabolic Higgs bundles. We also simplify our previous results in the regular case by re-writing the formulas for motivic classes in terms of the HLV generating function.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Universal Speed Limit on Fast Scrambling in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the time required for sustained information scrambling in any Hamiltonian quantum system is universally at least logarithmic in the entanglement entropy of scrambled states. This addresses two foundational problems in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. (1) It sets the earliest possible time for the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics in a quantum system coupled to a bath at a finite temperature. (2) It proves a version of the fast scrambling conjecture, originally motivated in models associated with black holes, as a fundamental property of quantum mechanics itself. Our result builds on a refinement of the energy-time uncertainty principle in terms of the infinite temperature spectral form factor in quantum chaos. We generalize this formulation to arbitrary initial states of the bath, including finite temperature states, by mapping Hamiltonian dynamics with any initial state to nonunitary dynamics at infinite temperature. A regularized spectral form factor emerges naturally from this procedure, whose decay is universally constrained by analyticity in complex time. This establishes an exact speed limit on information scrambling by the most general quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, without any restrictions on locality or the nature of interactions.</description>

      <title>Accretion disks properties around regular black hole solutions obtained from non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of spherically symmetric, static, charged regular black hole solutions derived within the framework of Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics. Our study focuses on examining the characteristics of accretion disks in the spacetimes described by the Dymnikova and Fan-Wang solutions. We explore circular geodesics of test particles and calculate various properties, including the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, radiant energy, temperature, and conversion efficiency of accretion mass into radiation. We employ the Novikov-Thorne-Page thin accretion disk model as a background. By comparing our findings with those obtained in the Schwarzschild black hole case, we reveal significant modifications in the overall spectral properties. Specifically, we observe an increase in the energy emitted from the disk surface, resulting in higher temperatures for the accretion disks under certain values of the free parameters. Consequently, we note an enhanced efficiency of mass conversion into radiation compared to the Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Gauge Equivalence through Gauge Fixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomena in gauge theory are often described in the physics literature via a specific choice of gauge. In foundational and philosophical discussions this is often criticized as introducing gauge dependence, and contrasted against (often aspirational) "gauge-invariant" descriptions of the physics. I argue, largely in the context of scalar electrodynamics, that this is misguided, and that descriptions of a physical process within a specific gauge are in fact gauge-invariant descriptions. However, most of them are non-local descriptions of that physics, and I suggest that this ought to be the real objection to such descriptions. I explore the unitary gauge as the exception to this nonlocality and consider its strengths and limitations, as well as (more briefly) its extension beyond scalar electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>3+1 non-linear evolution of Ricci-coupled scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with an additional coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar exhibits very interesting properties related to black hole stability, evasion of binary pulsar constraints, and general relativity as a late-time cosmology attractor. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a spherically symmetric collapse is well-posed for a wide range of parameters. In the present paper we examine further the well-posedness through $3+1$ evolution of static and rotating black holes. We show that the evolution is indeed hyperbolic if the weak coupling condition is not severely violated. The loss of hyperbolicity is caused by the gravitational sector of the physical modes, thus it is not an artifact of the gauge choice. We further seek to compare the Ricci-coupled sGB theory against the standard sGB gravity with additional terms in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We find strong similarities in terms of well-posedness, but we also point out important differences in the stationary solutions. As a byproduct, we show strong indications that stationary near-extremal scalarized black holes exist within the Ricci-coupled sGB theory, where the scalar field is sourced by the spacetime curvature rather than the black hole spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codes APFEL++ and HOPPET within the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Partial Renormalization of Quasiparticle Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <title>Tricriticality in 4D U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4D compact U(1) gauge theory has a well-established phase transition between a confining and a Coulomb phase. In this paper, we revisit this model using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations on anisotropic lattices. We map out the coupling-temperature phase diagram, and determine the location of the tricritical point, $T/K_0 \simeq 0.19$, below which the first-order transition is observed. We find the critical exponents of the high-temperature second-order transition to be compatible with those of the 3-dimensional $O(2)$ model. Our results at higher temperatures can be compared with literature results and are consistent with them. Surprisingly, below $T/K_0 \simeq 0.05$ we find strong indications of a second tricritical point where the first-order transition becomes continuous. These results suggest an unexpected second-order phase transition extending down to zero temperature, contrary to the prevailing consensus. If confirmed, these findings reopen the question of the detailed characterization of the transition including a suitable field theory description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the construction of the Alcubierre-Natario class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resemble the Weak Painleve-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three-dimensional spacetimes introduces conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates a non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and negative energy densities associated with this class of warp drives and find interesting deviations due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Several generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>NLO thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation cross sections: a novel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density has been increasingly accurately measured by successive generations of experiments. The Boltzmann equation determines the yields using the dark matter annihilation cross section as one of the inputs; the accurate computation of the latter including thermal contributions thus assumes importance. We report here the next-to-leading order (NLO) thermal corrections to the cross sections for (Majorana) dark matter annihilation to standard model fermions: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$, via charged scalars. We use a novel approach, utilising the technique of Grammer and Yennie, extended to thermal field theories, where the cancellation of soft infra-red divergences occurs naturally. We present the NLO thermal cross sections in full detail for both the relativistic case as well as in the non-relativistic limit. Our independent calculation verifies earlier results where the leading contribution at order ${\cal{O}}(T^2)$ was shown to be proportional to the square of the fermion mass in the non-relativistic limit, just as at leading order. We find that the ${\cal{O}}(T^4)$ contributions have the same dependence on the fermion mass as well.</description>

      <title>Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter: testing the viability of weak gravity conjecture and weak cosmic censorship conjecture simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible violation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by cosmic censorship is one of the major challenges in the field of general relativity. However, in this paper, we explore the possibility of reconciling the WGC and the WCCC by considering Reissner-Nordstr\"om (R-N) black holes embedded in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These two conjectures are seemingly unrelated, but a recent proposal suggested that they are connected surprisingly. In particular, We argue a promising class of valid counterexamples to the WCCC in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, considering a charged black hole when WGC is present. We demonstrate that by imposing certain constraints on the parameters of the metric, the WGC and the WCCC can be compatible. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the charged black hole in the presence of PFDM for $Q &gt; M$ and present some intriguing figures to test the validity of the WGC and the WCCC simultaneously. When PFDM is absent ($\gamma=0$), the RN black hole either has two event horizons if $Q^2/M^2\leq 1$ or none if $Q^2/M^2&gt; 1$. The second scenario results in a naked singularity, which contradicts the WCCC. But when PFDM is present ($\gamma\neq 0$), the RN black hole has event horizons with regard to Q and M. This implies that the singularity is always covered, and the WGC and the WCCC are fulfilled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a critical value of $\gamma$, called $\gamma_{ext}$, that makes the RN black hole extremal when $\gamma=\gamma_{ext}$. In this situation, the black hole has an event horizon, and the WGC and the WCCC are still fulfilled. We infer that PFDM can make the WGC and the WCCC compatible with the RN black hole and that the WGC and the WCCC agree with each other when PFDM is present.</description>

Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual Channel-State duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss matters related to the point that topological quantization in the strong interaction is a consequence of an infinite spacetime volume. Because of the ensuing order of limits, i.e. infinite volume prior to summing over topological sectors, CP is conserved. Here, we show that this reasoning is consistent with the construction of the path integral from steepest-descent contours. We reply to some objections that aim to support the case for CP violation in the strong interactions that are based on the role of the CP-odd theta-parameter in three-form effective theories, the correct sampling of all configurations in the dilute instanton gas approximation and the volume dependence of the partition function. We also show that the chiral effective field theory derived from taking the volume to infinity first is in no contradiction with analyses based on partially conserved axial currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some general aspects of fluctuation and dissipation in the holographic scenario at zero and finite density. We model this situation with a probe string in a diagonal metric representing a black brane. The string stretches from the black brane to a probe brane thus simulating a stochastic driven particle. In this scenario, we compute the admittance, the diffusion coefficient, the correlation functions and the regularized mean square displacement, for bosons and fermions, all from the metric components. We check these calculations with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we show that at finite temperature and density, the mean square displacement in the limit of short times reproduces the usual quadratic (ballistic) behavior, for bosons and fermions. For large times, we find ultraslow diffusive processes in various cases, except for bosons at zero chemical potential. We apply this general analysis in two different models: hyperscaling violation at finite temperature and a charged dilatonic AdS black hole, both for bosons and fermions. This is important because we found the fermionic diffusion in systems which allow the appearance of Fermi surfaces and Fermi liquids.</description>

Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Proof of $A_{n}$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AGT conjecture reveals a connection between 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory and 2D conformal field theory. Though some special instances have been proven, others remain elusive and the attempts on its full proof never stop. When the $\Omega$ background parameters satisfy $-\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2\equiv \beta =1$, the story simplifies a bit. A proof of the correspondence in the case of $A_{1}$ gauge group was given in 2010 by Mironov et al., while the $A_{n}$ extension is verified by Matsuo and Zhang in 2011, with an assumption on the Selberg integral of $n+1$ Schur polynomials. Then in 2020, Albion et al. obtained the rigorous result of this formula. In this paper, we show that their result is equivalent to the conjecture on Selberg integral of Schur polynomials, thus leading to the proof of the $A_{n}$ case at $\beta=1$. To perform a double check, we also directly start from this formula, and manage to show the identification between the two sides of AGT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model. We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and, perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations. This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We perform a general analysis of thin-wall Q-balls in AdS space. We provide numeric solutions and highly accurate analytic approximations over much of the parameter space. These analytic solutions show that AdS Q-balls exhibit significant differences from the corresponding flat space solitons. This includes having a maximum radius beyond which the Q-balls are unstable to a new type of state where the Q-ball coexists with a gas of massive particles. The phase transition to this novel state is found to be a zero-temperature third-order transition. This, through the AdS/CFT correspondence, has implications for a scalar condensate in the boundary theory.</description>

      <title>Counting $\mathcal{N} = 8$ Black Holes as Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the helicity trace index $B_{14}$ for $\mathcal{N} = 8$ pure D-brane black holes using various techniques of computational algebraic geometry and find perfect agreement with the existing results in the literature. For these black holes, microstate counting is equivalent to finding the number of supersymmetric vacua of a multi-variable supersymmetric quantum mechanics which in turn is equivalent to solving a set of multi-variable polynomial equations with syzygies. We explore four different techniques to solve a set of polynomial equations, namely Newton Polytopes, Homotopy continuation, Monodromy and Hilbert series. Unlike other schemes, these methods are almost exact with a very high success rate for finding all solutions. A gauge invariant analysis is also possible using the symbolic Hilbert series. Furthermore, exploiting various exchange symmetries, we show the non-existence of a quartic and(or) higher order terms in the potential which if present would have spoiled the counting. Incorporating recent developments in mathematics, algorithms and multi-threading, we have extended the scope of one of the author's previous works to other charges and presented a new perspective for the microstate counting problem. This further establishes the pure D-brane system as a consistent model, bringing us a step closer to $\mathcal{N} = 2$ black hole counting.</description>

      <title>About gravitational radiation of semi local strings with non compact internal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work studies the gravitational radiation of a non abelian vortex with a non compact internal moduli describing its excitations. This situation may be realised by semi-local supersymmetric vortices \cite{novedad1}-\cite{reviewshifman}, although supersymmetry is not necessary for this to happen. In the situation considered along this work, the internal space has infinite volume, and a largely energetic perturbation propagates along the object, even though the vortex line may not be moving. A specific configuration is presented, in which the internal space is the resolved conifold with its Ricci flat metric. The curious feature about it is that it corresponds to a static vortex, that is, the perturbation is only due to the internal modes. Even being static, the emission of gravitational radiation is in the present case of considerable order. This suggest that the presence of slowly moving objects that can emit a large amount of gravitational radiation is a hint of non abelianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the scalar potential in the Litim-Sannino model. We compute for the first time the full quantum corrections to the classical potential and show that they significantly ameliorate the stability analysis at the UV fixed point. The quantum effective potential is computed at two-loop order and the numerical precision is further improved using resummations and parameter optimisations. As a result, we find a consistent widening of the UV conformal window across various approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that on-shell excitations with large negative energies are created rapidly when the string coupling increases with time. This does not indicate an inconsistency in string theory since the negative energy on-shell excitation is always entangled with an on-shell excitation with a positive energy. The total energy of this energy-EPR state vanishes. We discuss the reason the energy-EPR states appear in string theory and the role they might play in black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Reflections on an M-theoretic Emergence Proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a pedagogical manner, we review recent developments in the investigation of the Emergence Proposal. Although it is fair to say that this idea is still at an exploratory level and a fully coherent picture has yet to be developed, we put it into perspective to previous work on the swampland program and on emergence in QG. In view of the emergent string conjecture, we argue and provide evidence that it is not the emergent string but rather the decompactification limit which is a natural candidate for the potential realization of the Emergence Proposal. This resonates in a compelling way with old ideas of emergence in M(-atrix) theory and gives rise to a number of further speculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

Abstract: We explore new aspects of internal fermionic shifting symmetries, present in physical systems such as free Dirac spinors and p-form tensor-spinor fields. We propose a novel procedure to gauge these global symmetries, which also introduces a new St\"uckelberg mechanism to give a mass to free fermionic fields. Furthermore, we find new magnetic fermionic symmetries in these physical systems whose charged objects are disorder operators. For the case of a Dirac spinor, we discuss an dual description, where the magnetic symmetry acts on the holonomies of a dual 2-form tensor-spinor. Further generalizations such as higher-group-like structures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entanglement Capacity of de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>

      <title>Late time dynamics in SUSY saddle-dominated scrambling through higher-point OTOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the scrambling dynamics in supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems. The eigenstate representation of such supersymmetric systems allows us to present an explicit form of the $2N$-point out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) using two equivalent formalisms viz. "Tensor Product formalism" and "Partner Hamiltonian formalism". We analytically compute the $2N$-point OTOC for the supersymmetric 1D harmonic oscillator and find that the result is in exact agreement with that of the OTOC of the 1D bosonic harmonic oscillator system. The higher-point OTOC is a more sensitive measure of scrambling than the usual 4-point OTOC. To demonstrate this feature, we consider a supersymmetric sextic 1D oscillator for which the bosonic partner system has an unstable saddle in the phase space, which is absent in the fermionic counterpart. For such a system we show that the bosonic, the fermionic as well as the supersymmetric OTOC exhibit similar dynamics due to supersymmetry constraints. Finally, we illustrate the late-time oscillatory behaviour of higher-point OTOC for saddle-dominated scrambling and anharmonic oscillator systems and propose it to be a probe of late-time dynamics in non-chaotic systems that exhibit fast early-time scrambling.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the inversion temperature associated with the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom black holes. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems involves numerical solutions and the results are presented as temperature-pressure plots for various values of the parameters of our model. We find non-zero minimum inversion temperatures as well as non-zero minimum pressures depending on the values of those parameters. Completing our study, we also find isenthalpic curves associated with black hole fixed mass processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP Violation beyond the Standard Model and the PQ Quality with Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), one of the leading low energy consequences of the model appears in the form of the chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) of the gluons and light quarks. We examine if these CEDMs can be distinguished from the QCD $\theta$-term through the experimentally measurable nucleon and atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in both cases with and without the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism solving the strong CP problem. We find that the nucleon EDMs can show a distinctive pattern when the EDMs are dominantly induced by light quark CEDMs without the PQ mechanism. In the presence of the PQ mechanism, the nucleon EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have a similar pattern as those due to the QCD $\theta$-parameter, regardless of the origin of the axion vacuum value which determines the $\theta$-parameter. In contrast, diamagnetic atomic EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have characteristic patterns distinguishable from the pattern due to the $\theta$-parameter which is induced dominantly by UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly, for instance by quantum gravity effects. Our results suggest that EDMs may provide information not only on CP violation beyond the SM, but also on the existence of the PQ mechanism and the quality of the PQ symmetry characterized by the strength of UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Bergmann analysis and Degrees of Freedom of Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagating degrees of freedom of $f(Q)$-gravity in a $4$-dimensional space-time under the imposition of the coincident gauge by performing the Dirac-Bergmann analysis. In this work, we start with a top-down reconstruction of the metric-affine gauge theory of gravity based only on the concept of a vector bundle. Then, the so-called geometrical trinity of gravity is introduced and the role of the coincident GR is clarified. After that, we reveal relationships between the boundary terms in the variational principle and the symplectic structure of the theory in order to confirm the validity of the analysis for our studied theories. Then, as examples, we revisit the analysis of GR and its $f(\lc{R})$-extensions. Finally, after reviewing the Dirac-Bergmann analysis of the coincident GR and that of $f(T)$-gravity, we perform the analysis of coincident $f(Q)$-gravity. Under the imposition of appropriate spatial boundary conditions, we find that, as a generic case, the theory has five primary, three secondary, and two tertiary constraint densities and all these constraint densities are classified into second-class constraint density; the number six is the propagating degrees of freedom of the theory and there are no longer any remaining gauge degrees of freedom. We also discuss the condition of providing seven pDoF as a generic case. The violation of diffeomorphism invariance of coincident $f(Q)$-gravity make it possible to emerge such several sectors.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study local gauge theories on manifolds with boundaries and asymptotic symmetries, which is based on representing them as so-called gauge PDEs. These objects extend the conventional BV-AKSZ sigma-models to the case of not necessarily topological and diffeomorphism invariant systems and are known to behave well with respect to restrictions to submanifolds and boundaries. We introduce the notion of gauge PDE with boundaries, which takes into account generic boundary conditions, and apply the framework to asymptotically flat gravity. In so doing we start with a suitable representation of gravity as a gauge PDE with boundaries which implements the Penrose's description of asymptotically simple spacetimes. We then derive the minimal model of the gauge PDE induced on the boundary and observe that it provides the Cartan (frame-like) description of a (curved) conformal Carollian structure on the boundary. Furthermore, imposing a suitable version of the familiar boundary conditions in the induced boundary gauge PDE immediately leads to the conventional BMS algebra of asymptotic symmetries. Finally, we briefly sketch the construction in the case of asymptotically (A)dS gravity.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve the bound state problem for Varshni-Hellmann potential via a useful technique. In our technique, we obtain the bound state solution of the Schrodinger equation for the Varshni-Hellmann potential via ansatz method. We obtain the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigen-functions. Also, the behavior of the energy spectra for both the ground and the excited state of the two body systems is illustrated graphically. The similarity of our results to the accurate numerical values is indicative of the efficiency of our technique.</description>

Abstract: We observe that the energy and the enthalpy densities can be smeared by two fudge factors that are constrained by the contracted Bianchi identities. Depending on the analytic properties of the smearing functions the underlying cosmological solutions belong to two physically different classes, namely the bounces of the scale factor and the curvature bounces. While the curvature bounces are naturally compatible with a stage of accelerated expansion, the bounces of the scale factor demand an early phase of accelerated contraction even if a short inflationary stage may arise prior to the decelerated regime. Despite the regularity of the underlying solutions, gradient instabilities and singularities do occasionally appear in the evolution of curvature inhomogeneities. After deducing the specific criteria behind these occurrences, the background-independent conclusions are corroborated by a series of concrete examples associated with different forms of the smearing functions. The evolution of the curvature inhomogeneities restricts the ranges of the solutions that turn out to be unsuitable even for a limited description of the pre-inflationary initial data. The same observation holds in the case of the gauge-invariant evolution of the matter density contrast. It is however not excluded that a class of scenarios (mainly associated with the curvature bounces) could indeed avoid the potential instabilities. All in all the present analysis explore a general approach whose results are relevant in all the contexts where bouncing solutions are invoked either as complementary or as alternative to the conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>
