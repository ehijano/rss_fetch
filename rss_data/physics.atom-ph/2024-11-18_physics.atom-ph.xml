      <title>The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.</description>

      <title>Post-selection shifts the transition frequency of helium in an atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-selecting output states in measurements can effectively amplify weak signals and improve precision. However, post-selection effects may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of post-selection in the precision spectroscopy of the $2^3S - 2^3P$ transition of helium ($^4$He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that post-selection based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately -55 kHz. After accounting for this post-selection shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of $276,764,094,712.45 \pm 0.86$ kHz for the $2^3S_1 - 2^3P_0$ transition. Combining this result with existing data for $^3$He, we derive a new value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, $\delta r^2 [r_{h}^{2} - r_{\alpha}^{2}] = 1.0733 \pm 0.0021$ fm$^2$. This value shows a $2.8\sigma$ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement and feed-forward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Resonant stroboscopic Rydberg dressing: electron-motion coupling and multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing traditionally refers to a technique where interactions between cold atoms are imprinted through the far off-resonant continuous-wave excitation of high-lying Rydberg states. Dipolar interactions between these electronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground state atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing protocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic fashion. The first one is non-adiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by fast pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in electron-motion coupling, which generates effective multi-body interactions. In the second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying laser pulses. We show that also in this protocol substantial multi-body interactions emerge.</description>

      <title>Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Trajectory effects on charge exchange and energy loss in collisions of H$^+$, He$^{2+}$, Li$^{3+}$, and Be$^{4+}$ ions with atomic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge exchange and energy loss processes provide insights into fundamental processes across physical, chemical, and engineered systems. While this field has been thoroughly investigated, a clear study on trajectory effects is lacking, particularly in the context of inelastic processes at low energies. In this work, we address this gap by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the electron in a numerical lattice with a coupled electron-nuclear dynamics approach as well as a straight-line trajectory approximation for the nuclei to asses trajectory effects on charge exchange and energy loss. The collision dynamics are studied using bare ion projectiles with charge $Z=$1-4 incident on atomic hydrogen in an energy range of 0.1 to 900 keV/u. We find that the charge exchange process is trajectory-independent within the energy range considered, showing excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. However, projectile energy loss exhibits strong trajectory dependence, with the straight-line approximation overestimating energy loss at low collision energies due to the forced linear path. Our results for electronic stopping cross sections with electron-nuclear coupled trajectories are consistent with the available experimental data at high collision energies. At low energies, nuclear energy loss becomes prominent, driven by polarization effects induced by the ion charge on the hydrogen target. Overall, our work highlights the importance of nuclear trajectory considerations in collision dynamics and offers a foundation for further investigations of more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency induced Autler-Townes Effect for single- and double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the Autler-Townes effect in single- and suspected double-photon magnetic-dipole transitions in the Cesium ground-state magnetic-sublevel manifold. Experiments were performed in a Cesium vapor cell. The D$_1$ line was excited by laser radiation to create ground-state optical polarization, and transitions between the ground-state magnetic sublevels were excited by radio-frequency (RF) radiation. Two different excitation geometries were studied: in one case the electric field vector of the linearly polarized laser radiation was parallel to the static magnetic field, whereas in the other case these vectors were perpendicular. The oscillating magnetic field produced by the RF coils was in the plane perpendicular to the electric field vector of the laser radiation. The Autler-Townes effect was confirmed by its linear dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude, which is proportional to the Rabi frequency, in the case of single-photon transitions. We also observed peaks that by their position appeared to correspond to double and even triple photon transitions, which were more pronounced when the DC magnetic field and optical electric field vectors were perpendicular. In the peak at an energy that corresponds to two photons, splitting with a quadratic dependence on the RF magnetic field amplitude could be observed. The experimental measurements are supplemented by theoretical calculations of a model $J=1 \longrightarrow J=0$ system.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to 1S-2S transition in muonium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the energy interval (1S-2S) in muonium. Various amplitudes of interaction of a muon and an electron are constructed, in which the effect of hadronic scattering of light-by-light is determined using the transition form factor of two photons into a meson. Their contributions to the particle interaction operator in the case of S-states are obtained in integral form, and to the energy spectrum in numerical form. The contributions of pseudoscalar, scalar, axial vector mesons are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Design fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gates with synthetic modulated driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cold atom qubit platform emerges as an attractive choice for the next stage of quantum computation research, where a special family of synthetic analytical pulses has considerably improved the experimental performance of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates in recent studies. The success of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates triggers the intriguing question of whether the two-qubit Rydberg blockade gate SWAP gate exists. Via investigating the transition linkage structure, we provide a definitive answer to this question and establish the method of fast SWAP Rydberg blockade gates with synthetic continuously-modulated driving. These gate protocols use careful analysis to properly generate coherent population transfer and phase accumulation of the wave function in the atom-laser interaction process. They can adapt to finite Rydberg blockade strengths and bear considerable resistance some major adverse effects such as laser fluctuations. Further examinations reveal that we can anticipate satisfying performances of the method with currently available experimental techniques in relevant research areas.</description>

      <title>Observation of electric field induced superradiance slowdown in ultracold Rydberg atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms excited to electronically high-lying Rydberg states decay to low-energy states through spontaneous emission processes. We investigate the impact of a static electric field on the superradiant emission process between Rydberg $|60D_{5/2}\rangle$ and $|61P_{3/2}\rangle$ states in an ultracold Cesium Rydberg atom ensemble. We report experimental observations of a significant slowdown in superradiance upon applying an electric field. To understand the slowing down dynamics, we employ a discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) method to solve the corresponding master equation numerically. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that superradiance decoherence is caused by the Stark shifts of the Rydberg level. Our theoretical simulations qualitatively match the experimental observations. Our work provides new insights into controlling quantum critical behaviors, with implications for quantum many-body dynamics, and the study of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent three-photon excitation of the strontium clock transition with a contrast of 51(12)% using a Bose-Einstein condensate. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer, overcoming the typical limitations of this technique to odd-level numbers. We also measure the two-body loss coefficient of $^{84}$Sr clock-state atoms. Our work constitutes an essential step towards outcoupling a continuous atom laser beam and provides a fast excitation mechanism for quantum simulation using bosonic alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>
