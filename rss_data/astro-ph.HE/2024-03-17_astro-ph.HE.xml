      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Magnetized Mergers of Black Holes and Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration has observed gravitational waves consistent with the mergers of a black hole and a neutron star, namely GW200105 and GW200115, providing evidence for such cataclysmic events. Although no electromagnetic counterpart was reported for either of these two events, under certain conditions black hole--neutron star mergers are expected to form a significant accretion disk and to produce both a short gamma ray burst and a kilonova, much as observed in the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Here, we extend our publicly available code \mhduet to study numerically the merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole. \mhduet employs Large Eddy Simulation techniques to help capture the magnetic field amplification resulting from turbulence and other sub-grid scale dynamics in the post-merger stage. In particular, we simulate a merger with parameters favorable to producing an accretion disk, focusing on the formation and dynamics of the turbulent disk and the resulting magnetic field amplification. Following the tidal disruption and during the formation of the accretion disk, the magnetic field undergoes significant amplification driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, reaching strengths of more than $10^{14}\,\rm{G}$ from a realistic initial strength of $10^{11}\,\rm{G}$ in short timescales of approximately $20\,\rm{ms}$. At later times in our simulations the magnetic field growth occurs at larger scales and is dominated mainly by magnetic winding.</description>

      <title>The Fermi/eROSITA Bubbles: A look into the nuclear outflow from the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic outflows are ubiquitous in galaxies containing active star formation or supermassive black hole activity. The presence of a large-scale outflow from the center of our own Galaxy was confirmed after the discovery of two large ($\sim 8-10$ kpc) \gamma-ray bubbles using the \textit{Fermi-LAT} telescope. These bubbles, known as the Fermi Bubbles, are highly symmetric about the Galactic disk as well as around the Galactic rotation axis and appear to emanate from the center of our Galaxy. The sharp edges of these bubbles suggest that they are related to the Galactic outflow. These bubbles are surrounded by two even bigger ($\sim 12-14$ kpc) X-ray structures, known as the eROSITA bubbles. Together, they represent the characteristics of an outflow from the Galaxy into the circumgalactic medium. Multi-wavelength observations such as in radio, microwave, and UV toward the Fermi Bubbles have provided us with much information in the last decade. However, the origin and the nature of these bubbles remain elusive. In this review, I summarize the observations related to the Fermi/eROSITA Bubbles at different scales and wavelengths, and give a brief overview of our current understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Measurements of All-Particle Energy Spectrum and Mean Logarithmic Mass of Cosmic Rays from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the measurements of all-particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays in the energy range of 0.3-30 PeV using data collected from LHAASO-KM2A between September 2021 and December 2022, which is based on a nearly composition-independent energy reconstruction method, achieving unprecedented accuracy. Our analysis reveals the position of the knee at $3.67 \pm 0.05 \pm 0.15$ PeV. Below the knee, the spectral index is found to be -$2.7413 \pm 0.0004 \pm 0.0050$, while above the knee, it is -$3.128 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.027$, with the sharpness of the transition measured with a statistical error of 2%. The mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays is almost heavier than helium in the whole measured energy range. It decreases from 1.7 at 0.3 PeV to 1.3 at 3 PeV, representing a 24% decline following a power law with an index of -$0.1200 \pm 0.0003 \pm 0.0341$. This is equivalent to an increase in abundance of light components. Above the knee, the mean logarithmic mass exhibits a power law trend towards heavier components, which is reversal to the behavior observed in the all-particle energy spectrum. Additionally, the knee position and the change in power-law index are approximately the same. These findings suggest that the knee observed in the all-particle spectrum corresponds to the knee of the light component, rather than the medium-heavy components.</description>

      <title>Revealing mysteries in gamma-ray bursts: the role of gluon condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a special gluon distribution in the nucleon, which was predicted by a QCD evolution equation to consistently explain several intriguing phenomena associated with gamma-ray bursts. They are the GeV-TeV spectra of GRB 221009A, the remarkably symmetrical explosion cloud in kilonova AT2017gfo, and the absence of a very high-energy gamma-ray signature in GRB 170817A. We find that these occurrences can be attributed to the gluon condensation within nucleons, i.e., a significant number of soft gluons within nucleons are condensed at a critical momentum, resulting in the emergence of a steep and high peak in the gluon distributions. Through this profound connection between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, we have not only expanded the applications of the hadronic scenario in cosmic gamma-ray emissions but also presented new evidence for the existence of gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Is Abell 3667 an offset merger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 3667 is a near-by (z=0.056) merging cluster with the most prominent cold front and a pair of two bright radio relics. Assuming a face-to-face merger scenario, the origin of the cold front is often considered to be a remnant core of the cluster stripped of its surrounding ICM. Sarazin et al. (2016) proposed an offset merger scenario in which the sub-cluster cores rotate after the first core-crossing. To distinguish between these scenarios, we revisited the ICM distribution and measured the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity using a calibration technique proposed by Sanders et al. (2020). In the unsharp masked image, we identified several ICM features, some of which we detected for the first time. There is an enhancement of the X-ray surface brightness extending from the 1st BCG to the cold front, which is named the "BCG-E tail". The notable feature is the "RG1 vortex", which is a clockwise vortex-like enhancement with a radius of about 250 kpc connecting the 1st BCG to the radio galaxy (RG1). It is particularly enhanced near the north of the 1st BCG, which is named the "BCG-N tail". The thermodynamic map shows that the ICM in the RG1 vortex has a relatively high abundance of 0.5-0.6 solar compared to the surrounding regions. The ICM of the BCG-E tail also has high abundance, and low pseudo-entropy, and can be interpreted as the remnant of the ICM of the cluster core. Including its arc-like shape, the RG1 vortex supports the idea that the ICM around the cluster center is rotating, which is natural in an offset merger scenario. The results of the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity measurement show that the ICM around the BCG-N tail is redshifted with a velocity difference of 940$\pm$440 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the optical redshift of the 1st BCG. Other symptoms of diversity in the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM were also obtained and discussed in the context of the offset merger.</description>

      <title>Peak energy--Isotropic Luminosity Correlation and Jet Opening Angle Evolution in Swift-BAT Short GRBs with Soft Tail Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) exhibit a short duration and spectral hard emission (referred to as a "hard spike") followed by a slightly longer soft emission (known as a "soft tail"). We identified nine SGRBs with known redshift in the \textit{Swift}/BAT gamma-ray burst catalog by specifically searching for the soft tail. We found that spectra of these SGRBs can be described as a cutoff power-law model for both hard spike and soft tail, and both show time variation keeping the $E_{\rm peak}$--$L_{\rm iso}$ correlation. This suggests that the emission mechanism of both phenomena is identical. Furthermore, we found a trend of luminosity evolution as a function of redshift. This phenomenon suggests that these bursts originate from sources that have intrinsically bright and/or energy density concentrated within a narrower jet at higher redshift. We demonstrate that the average jet opening angle, derived from the jet break, can be explained by considering a model based on a strongly redshift-dependent jet opening angle.</description>

      <title>Searching for precursor activity of Type IIn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a search for luminous outbursts prior to the explosion of Type IIn Supernovae (SNe IIn). We built a sample of 27 objects spectroscopically classified as SNe IIn, all located at $z&lt;0.015$. Using deep archival SN fields images taken up to nearly 20 years prior from transient surveys (PTF, ZTF, DES, CHASE) and major astronomical observatories (ESO and NOAO), we found at least one outburst years to months before the explosion of seven SNe IIn, the earliest precursor being 10 years prior to the explosion of SN 2019bxq. The maximum absolute magnitudes of the outbursts range between -11.5 mag and -15 mag, and the eruptive phases last for a few weeks to a few years. The $g-r$ colour measured for three objects during their outburst is relatively red, with $g-r$ ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 mag. This is similar to the colour expected during the eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables. We noticed that the SNe with pre-SN outbursts have light curves with faster decline rates than those that do not show pre-SN outbursts. SN 2011fh is remarkable, as it is still visible 12 years after the luminous SN-like event, indicating that the progenitor possibly survived, or that the interaction is still on-going. We detect precursor activity in 29% of bona-fide SNe~IIn in our sample. However, a quantitative assessment of the observational biases affecting the sample suggests that this fraction underestimates the intrinsic precursor occurrence rate.</description>

      <title>The role of heating on the formation and the dynamics of YSO jets : I. A parametric study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments as well as observations of young stellar objects (YSO) support the presence of a diversified circumstellar environment. A stellar jet is thought to account for most of the stellar spin down and disk wind outflow for the observed high mass loss rate, thus playing a major role in the launching of powerful jets. RY Tau, for instance, is an extensively studied intermediate mass pre-main sequence star. Observational data reveal a small scale jet called microjet. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the microjet shapes the jet observed at a large scale. The goal is to investigate the spatial stability and structure of the central jet at a large scale by mixing the stellar and disk components. We mix two existing analytical self-similar models for the disk and the stellar winds to build the initial set-ups. Instead of using a polytropic equation of state, we map from the analytical solutions, the heating and cooling sources. The heating exchange rate is controlled by two parameters, its spatial extent and its intensity. The central jet and the surrounding disk are strongly affected by these two parameters. We separate the results in three categories, which show different emissivity, temperature, and velocity maps. We reached this categorization by looking at the opening angle of the stellar solution. For cylindrically, well collimated jets, we have opening angles as low as 10 degrees between 8 and 10 au, and for the wider jets, we can reach 30 degrees with a morphology closer to radial solar winds. Our parametric study shows that the less heated the outflow is, the more collimated it appears. We also show that recollimation shocks appear consistently with UV observations in terms of temperature but not density.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant from the $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$ shadow prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quasinormal mode detectability with next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of a binary black hole merger event, the gravitational wave signal emitted by the remnant black hole is modeled as a superposition of damped sinusoids known as quasinormal modes. While the dominant quasinormal modes originating from linear black hole perturbation theory have been studied extensively in this post-merger "ringdown" phase, more accurate models of ringdown radiation include the nonlinear modes arising from higher-order perturbations of the remnant black hole spacetime. We explore the detectability of quadratic quasinormal modes with both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. We quantify how predictions of the quadratic mode detectability depend on the quasinormal mode starting times. We then calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of quadratic modes for several detectors and binary black hole populations, focusing on the ($220\times220$) mode - i.e., on the quadratic term sourced by the square of the linear $(220)$ mode. For the events with the loudest quadratic mode signal-to-noise ratios, we additionally compute statistical errors on the mode parameters in order to further ascertain the distinguishability of the quadratic mode from the linear quasinormal modes. The astrophysical models used in this paper suggest that while the quadratic mode may be detectable in at most a few events with ground-based detectors, the prospects for detection with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are more optimistic.</description>

Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORC) are a newly discovered class of extended faint radio sources of unknown origin. We report the first detection of diffuse X-ray gas at the location of a low-redshift ORC (z=0.046), known as Cloverleaf ORC. This observation was performed with the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The physical extent of the diffuse X-ray emission corresponds to approximately a 230 kpc by 160 kpc region, lying perpendicular to the radio emission detected by ASKAP. The X-ray spectrum shows characteristics of thermal multi-phase gas with temperatures of $1.10\pm0.08$ keV and $0.22\pm0.01$ keV and a central density of $(4.9\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that the Cloverleaf ORC resides in a low-mass galaxy group. Using velocity dispersion measurements in the optical, the halo mass of the galaxy group has been reported as $\sim1.6\times10^{13}$ M$_{sun}$. The presence of a high-velocity subgroup identified in optical data, the orientation of the BCG, the disturbed morphologies of galaxies towards the east of the Cloverleaf ORC, and the irregular morphology of the X-ray emission suggest that this system is undergoing a galaxy group merger. The radio power of the ORC could be explained by the shock reacceleration of fossil cosmic rays generated by a previous episode of black hole activity in the central active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Virial Black Hole Masses for AGNs behind the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the spectroscopic data collected by the Magellanic Quasars Survey (MQS) as well as the photometric V- and I-band data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to measure the physical parameters for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) located behind the Magellanic Clouds. The flux-uncalibrated MQS spectra were obtained with the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope and the AAOmega spectroscope (R=1300) in a typical ~1.5-hour visit. They span a spectral range of 3700-8500 Angstroms and have S/N ratios in a range of 3-300. We report the discovery and observational properties of 161 AGNs in this footprint, which expands the total number of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs by MQS to 919. After converting the OGLE mean magnitudes to the monochromatic luminosities at 5100 Angstroms, 3000 Angstroms, and 1350 Angstroms, we reliably measured the black hole masses for 165 out of 919 AGNs. The remaining physical parameters we provide are the bolometric luminosities and the Eddington ratios. A fraction of these AGNs have been observed by the OGLE survey since 1997 (all of them since 2001), enabling studies of correlations between their variability and physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>

      <title>Effect of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB 221009A) on low energy gamma-ray counts at sea level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gamma-ray burst, named GRB 221009A, occurred on 9 October 2022 and is the brightest ever observed GRB, whose frequency is now estimated as once in 10,000 years. This GRB was reported to be observed from many space missions, VLF receivers, and ground observations in optical and radio data. Additionally, a strikingly large number of very high energy (VHE) photons associated with this GRB were observed by the gamma-ray and cosmic ray observatory LHAASO. Though gamma rays of cosmic origin usually tend to be absorbed by the atmosphere, the high fluence of this GRB, along with the observation of more than 5000 VHE photons (0.5 to 18 TeV) by LHAASO from the ground, emphasises the need to explore other possible ground observations of this GRB.
  The present paper examines the effect of this GRB using gamma-ray data in a low energy range (0.2-6) MeV obtained using NaI (Tl) detectors located at Tirunelveli (Geographic coordinates: 8.71{\deg}N, 77.76{\deg}E), India. With RA = 288.3{\deg} and Dec = 19.8{\deg}, the exceptionally bright fluence of this GRB was geographically centred on India. We report no significant change in the observations associated with GRB 221009A. We discuss the extent of attenuation of gamma-rays in the atmosphere that could explain the reported observations. Further, we investigate the likelihood of ground observation of gamma-rays ($&lt;$10 MeV) for a much more intense hypothetical GRB, and estimate the parameters, such as distance, fluence, and isotropic energy of such a GRB.</description>

      <title>Supernovae in 2023 (review): breakthroughs by late observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular phase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023 made progress towards breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the group of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a way unnoticed before in three CCSNRs. Comparison to multipolar planetary nebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as predicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of the historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023 revealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at the explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although the WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. An identification of point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the youngest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a planetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core degenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common, and might actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Zeeman splitting of torsional oscillation frequencies of magnetars</title>

Abstract: Magnetars form a special class of neutron stars possessing superstrong magnetic fields and demonstrating power flares triggered likely by these fields. Observations of such flares reveal the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at certain frequencies; they are thought to be excited in the flares. QPOs carry potentially important information on magnetar structure, magnetic field, and mechanisms of magnetar activity. We calculate frequencies of torsional (magneto-elastic) oscillations of the magnetar crust treating the magnetic field effects in the first order of perturbation theory. The theory predicts splitting of non-magnetic oscillation frequencies into Zeeman components. Zeeman splitting of torsional oscillation spectrum of magnetars was suggested, clearly described and estimated by Shaisultanov and Eichler (2009) but their work has not been given considerable attention. To extend it we suggest the technique of calculating oscillation frequencies including Zeeman splitting at not too strong magnetic fields for arbitrary magnetic field configuration. Zeeman splitting enriches the oscillation spectrum and simplifies theoretical interpretation of observations. We calculate several low-frequency oscillations of magnetars with pure dipole magnetic field in the crust. The results qualitatively agree with low-frequency QPOs detected in the hyperflare of SGR 1806--20, and in the giant flare of SGR 1900+14.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic observations of progenitor activity 100 days before a Type Ibn supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining spectroscopic observations of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is often unfeasible due to an inherent lack of knowledge as to which stars will go supernova and when they will explode. In this letter, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the progenitor activity of SN 2023fyq in the preceding 150 days before the He-rich progenitor exploded as a Type Ibn supernova. The progenitor of SN 2023fyq shows an exponential rise in flux prior to core-collapse. Complex He I emission line features are observed, with a P-Cygni like profile, as well as an evolving broad base with velocities on the order of 10,000 km/s, possibly due to electron scattering. The luminosity and evolution of SN 2023fyq are consistent with a faint Type Ibn, reaching a peak r-band magnitude of 18.1 mag, although there is some uncertainty in the distance to the host, NGC 4388, located in the Virgo cluster. We present additional evidence of asymmetric He-rich material being present prior to the explosion of SN 2023fyq, as well as after, suggesting this material has survived the ejecta-CSM interaction. Broad [O I] and the Ca II triplet lines are observed at late phases, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine supernova rather than a non-terminal interacting transient. SN 2023fyq provides insight into the final moments of a massive star's life, highlighting that the progenitor is likely highly unstable before core-collapse.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Population III Stars to Merging Binary Black Holes</title>

Abstract: A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraints on pseudo-Dirac neutrinos using high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can be pseudo-Dirac in Nature - they can be Majorana fermions while behaving effectively as Dirac fermions. Such scenarios predict active-sterile neutrino oscillations driven by a tiny mass-squared difference $(\delta m^2)$, which is an outcome of soft lepton number violation. Oscillations due to tiny $\delta m^2$ can only take place over astrophysical baselines and hence are not accessible in terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. This implies that high-energy neutrinos coming from large distances can be naturally used to test this scenario. We use the recent observation of high-energy neutrinos from the active galactic nuclei NGC 1068 by the IceCube collaboration to rule out $\delta m^2$ in the region $[1.4 \times 10^{-18}, 10^{-17}]\, {\rm eV}^2$ at more than $90\%$ confidence level - one of the strongest limits to date on the values of $\delta m^2$. We also discuss possible uncertainties which can reduce the sensitivity of these results.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight boson fields, with a mass around $10^{-23}\text{eV}$, are promising candidates for the elusive cosmological dark matter. These fields induce a periodic oscillation of the spacetime metric in the nanohertz frequency band, which is detectable by pulsar timing arrays. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational effect of ultralight tensor dark matter on the arrival time of radio pulses from pulsars. We find that the pulsar timing signal caused by tensor dark matter exhibits a different angular dependence than that by scalar and vector dark matter, making it possible to distinguish the ultralight dark matter signal with different spins. Combining the gravitational effect and the coupling effect of ultralight tensor dark matter with standard model matter provides a complementary way to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We estimate $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-6}\sim 10^{-5}$ in the mass range $m&lt;5\times 10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ with current pulsar timing array.</description>

      <title>Wave Generation by Flare-Accelerated Ions and Implications for 3He Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic ($T_{\parallel} &gt; T_{\perp}$), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and non-zero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of $^3$He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of $^3$He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated $^3$He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of $^3$He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of $^4$He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of $^3$He observed in impulsive flares.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Extruding Peaks in Speed of Sound Profiles of Massive Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound squared (SSS) $s^2$ in massive neutron stars (NSs) characterizes not only the stiffness of supradense neutron-rich matter within but also equivalently properties of the curved geometry due to the strong-field gravity and matter-geometry coupling. A peaked density or radius profile of $s^2$ has been predicted for massive NSs using various NS Equation of State (EOS) models. However, the nature, cause, location and size of the peak in $s^2$ profiles are still very EOS model dependent. In this work, we investigate systematically $s^2$ profiles in massive NSs in a new approach that is independent of the nuclear EOS model and without any presumption about the NS structure and/or composition. In terms of the small quantities (reduced radius, the energy density and pressure scaled by their central values), we perform double-element perturbative expansions in solving perturbatively the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and analyzing $s^2$ profiles from the Newtonian limit to the general relativistic (GR) case. The GR term in the TOV equations plays a twofold role: it compresses NS matter and modifies the pressure/energy density ratio from small values in Newtonian stars showing no $s^2$ peak to large ones for massive NSs possessing a peak in their $s^2$ profiles, and eventually takes away the peak in extremely compact/massive NSs approaching the causality limit. {In particular, the peaked behavior in $s^2$ is expected to emerge near the center of massive NSs like PSR J0740+6620, while a sharp phase transition is unlikely to occur there.} These features revealed from our analyses are universal as they are intrinsic properties of the GR stellar structure equations independent of the still very uncertain EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter in NSs.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy beyond Kerr: agnostic and theory-based tests with next-generation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy is a clean and powerful tool to test gravity in the strong-field regime and to probe the nature of compact objects. Next-generation ground-based detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will observe thousands of binary black hole mergers with large signal-to-noise ratios, allowing for accurate measurements of the remnant black hole quasinormal mode frequencies and damping times. In previous work we developed an observable-based parametrization of the quasinormal mode spectrum of spinning black holes beyond general relativity (ParSpec). In this paper we use this parametrization to ask: can next-generation detectors detect or constrain deviations from the Kerr spectrum by stacking multiple observations of binary mergers from astrophysically motivated populations? We focus on two families of tests: (i) agnostic (null) tests, and (ii) theory-based tests, which make use of quasinormal frequency calculations in specific modified theories of gravity. We consider in particular two quadratic gravity theories (Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity) and various effective field theory-based extensions of general relativity. We find that robust inference of hypothetical corrections to general relativity requires pushing the slow-rotation expansion to high orders. Even when high-order expansions are available, ringdown observations alone may not be sufficient to measure deviations from the Kerr spectrum for theories with dimensionful coupling constants. This is because the constraints are dominated by "light" black hole remnants, and only few of them have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in the ringdown. Black hole spectroscopy with next-generation detectors may be able to set tight constraints on theories with dimensionless coupling, as long as we assume prior knowledge of the mass and spin of the remnant black hole.</description>

      <title>WIMP constraints from black hole low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abnormally fast orbital decay observed in the black hole (BH) Low-Mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXB) A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480 can be explained by the dynamical friction between Dark Matter (DM) and the companion star orbiting around the low-mass BH (of a few $M_\odot$) of the system. In this case the value of the index $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ of the DM spike surrounding the BH can be pinned down with an accuracy of a few percent, way better than that for much bigger systems such as the super massive BHs (SMBHs) in the Galactic Center or in M87. We have used data from XTE J1118+480 to put bounds on the WIMP annihilation cross section times velocity $\langle \sigma v\rangle$, assuming that DM annihilation is driven by the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel and that it proceeds in $s$-wave. The bounds are driven by the radio synchrotron signal produced by $e^\pm$ final states propagating in the magnetic field near the BH. For DM masses $m_\chi$ up to the TeV scale XTE J1118+480 allows to constrain $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ well below $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$, corresponding to the observed DM relic density in the Universe for a thermal WIMP. On the other hand, for $m_\chi \gtrsim$ 15 GeV, the bounds from the SMBHs in the GC or in M87 do not reach $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$ when the very large uncertainties on the corresponding spike indices are taken into account, in spite of potentially producing much larger DM densities compared to XTE J1118+480. Our bounds for XTE J1118+480 have a mild sensitivity on spatial diffusion, but diffusion enhances the sensitivity of the results upon the intensity of the magnetic field. Taken at face value the bound from XTE J1118+480 on $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ is the most constraining compared to all others for $m_\chi\lesssim$ 1 TeV, unless the intensity of the magnetic field is significantly smaller than its equipartition estimation.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as the Dark Matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known for quite sometime that the Neutron Stars (NS) can play a role of the Dark Matter (DM) detectors due to many uniques features of NS. We apply these (previously developed) ideas to a specific form of the DM when it is represented by a composite object, rather than by a local fundamental field (such as WIMPs). To be more precise we consider the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQN) dark matter model, when the ``non-baryonic" dark matter in fact is made of quarks and gluons which are in dense quark phase (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets). We argue that the interaction of the AQNs with NS material may lead to many profound observable effects, which dramatically different from conventional picture when DM particles are represented by weakly interacting WIMPs. In particular, we argue that the AQNs may serve as the triggers for the magnetic reconnection to heat the NS surface. This effect may strongly alleviate (or even completely remove) the observed inconsistencies between the predicted and observed surface temperatures for many old NS. This heating mechanism is always accompanied by the hard X ray emission, which may serve as an indicator of the proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fast Identification of Transients: Applying Expectation Maximization to Neutrino Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as expectation maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological corrections to Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>
