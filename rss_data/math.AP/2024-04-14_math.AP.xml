      <description>arXiv:2404.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the stability of a heat-conducting copper rod and a magnetizable piezoelectric beam, with fractional damping affecting the longitudinal displacement of the piezoelectric material's centerline. We establish a polynomial stability result that is dependent on the order of the fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>Vortex-carrying solitary gravity waves of large amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two-dimensional traveling waves in finite-depth water that are acted upon solely by gravity. We prove that, for any supercritical Froude number (non-dimensionalized wave speed), there exists a continuous one-parameter family $\mathcal{C}$ of solitary waves in equilibrium with a submerged point vortex. This family bifurcates from an irrotational uniform flow, and, at least for large Froude numbers, extends up to the development of a surface singularity. These are the first rigorously constructed gravity wave-borne point vortices without surface tension, and notably our formulation allows the free surface to be overhanging. We also provide a numerical bifurcation study of traveling periodic gravity waves with submerged point vortices, which strongly suggests that some of these waves indeed overturn. Finally, we prove that at generic solutions on $\mathcal{C}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ including those that are large amplitude or even overhanging $\unicode{x2013}$ the point vortex can be desingularized to obtain solitary waves with a submerged hollow vortex. Physically, these can be thought of as traveling waves carrying spinning bubbles of air.</description>

      <title>An extension theorem for weak solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations and applications to singular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an extension theorem for local solutions of the 3d incompressible Euler equations. More precisely, we show that if a smooth vector field satisfies the Euler equations in a spacetime region $\Omega\times(0,T)$, one can choose an admissible weak solution on $\mathbf R^3\times (0,T)$ of class $C^\beta$ for any $\beta&lt;1/3$ such that both fields coincide on $\Omega\times (0,T)$. Moreover, one controls the spatial support of the global solution. Our proof makes use of a new extension theorem for local subsolutions of the incompressible Euler equations and a $C^{1/3}$ convex integration scheme implemented in the context of weak solutions with compact support in space. We present two nontrivial applications of these ideas. First, we construct infinitely many admissible weak solutions of class $C^\beta_{\text{loc}}$ with the same vortex sheet initial data, which coincide with it at each time $t$ outside a turbulent region of width $O(t)$. Second, given any smooth solution $v$ of the Euler equation on $\mathbf T^3\times(0,T)$ and any open set $U \subset \mathbf T^3$, we construct admissible weak solutions which coincide with $v$ outside $U$ and are uniformly close to it everywhere at time 0, yet blow up dramatically on a subset of $U\times (0,T)$ of full Hausdorff dimension. These solutions are of class $C^\beta$ outside their singular set.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness of the Master Equation for Mean Field Games with Grushin Type Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wellposedness of the master equation for a second-order mean field games with the Grushin type diffusion. In order to do this, we obtain the properties of its solution by investigating a degenerate mean field games system for which there exists an equivalent characterization with the master equation. The crucial points of this paper are to explore some regularities of solutions to two types of linear degenerate partial differential equations and a kind of degenerate linear coupled system so as to derive the existence of solutions to the master equation.</description>

      <title>Properties of fractional p-Laplace equations with sign-changing potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonlinear equation involving the fractional p-Laplacian with sign-changing potential. This model draws inspiration from De Giorgi Conjecture. There are two main results in this paper. Firstly, we obtain that the solution is radially symmetric within the bounded domain, by applying the moving plane method. Secondly, by exploiting the idea of the sliding method, we construct the appropriate auxiliary functions to prove that the solution is monotone increasing in some direction in the unbounded domain. The different properties of the solution in bounded and unbounded domains are mainly attributed to the inherent non-locality of the fractional p-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for two generalized poly-Laplacian systems on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity of solutions for a generalized poly-Laplacian system on weighted finite graphs and a generalized poly-Laplacian system with Dirichlet boundary value on weighted locally finite graphs, respectively, via the variational methods which are based on mountain pass theorem and topological degree theory. We obtain that these two systems have a sequence of minimax type solutions $\{(u_n,v_n)\}$ satisfying the energy functional $\varphi(u_n,v_n)\to +\infty$ as $n\to +\infty$ and a sequence of local minimum type solutions $\{(u_m^*,v_m^*)\}$ satisfying the energy functional $\varphi(u_m^*,v_m^*)\to -\infty$ as $m\to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Wigner kernel and Gabor matrix of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit the connection between the Wigner kernel and the Gabor matrix of a linear bounded operator T : $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathcal{S}' (\mathbb{R}^d)$. The smoothing effect of the Gabor matrix is highlighted by basic examples. This connection allows a comparison between the classes of Fourier integral operators defined by means of the Gabor matrix and the Wigner kernel, showing the nice off-diagonal decay of the Gabor class with respect to the Wigner kernel one and suggesting further investigations. Modulation spaces containing the Sj\"ostrand class are the symbol classes of this study.</description>

      <title>Variational Solvers for Irreversible Evolutionary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study irreversible evolutionary processes with a general energetic notion of stability. We dedicate this contribution to releasing three nonlinear variational solvers as modular components (based on FEniCSx/dolfinx) that address three mathematical optimisation problems. They are general enough to apply, in principle, to evolutionary systems with instabilities, jumps, and emergence of patterns which is commonplace in diverse arenas spanning from quantum to continuum mechanics, economy, social sciences, and ecology. Our motivation proceeds from fracture mechanics, with the ultimate goal of deploying a transparent numerical platform for scientific validation and prediction of large scale natural fracture phenomena. Our solvers are used to compute one solution to a problem encoded in a system of two inequalities: one (pointwise almost-everywhere) constraint of irreversibility and one global energy statement. As part of our commitment to open science, our solvers are released as free software.</description>

      <title>Wild solutions of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D incompressible axisymmetric swirl-free Euler equations. The convex integration method developed by De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi rules out the possibility that the Euler equations admit unique admissible weak solutions. It had remained conceivable, though, that axisymmetry of the solution might serve as a selection criterion. Using a surprising link to the 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, we will show that this is not the case: There exists initial data for which there are infinetely many admissible swirl-free axisymmetric weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Moreover, somewhat conversely, we show that there exists an axisymmetric swirl-free initial velocity for which the axisymmetry breaks down instantaneously.</description>

Abstract: We construct in the paper the low-regularity strong solutions to the viscous surface wave equations in anisotropic Sobolev spaces. Here we use the Lagrangian structure of the system to homogenize the free boundary conditions, and establish a new iteration scheme on a known equilibrium domain to get the low-regularity strong solutions, in which no nonlinear compatibility conditions on the initial data are required.</description>

      <title>Algebraic rates of stability for front-type modulated waves in Ginzburg Landau equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stability of front-type modulated waves in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL). The waves occur in the bistable regime (e.g. of the quintic CGL) and connect the zero state to a spatially homogenous state oscillating in time. For initial perturbations that decay at a certain algebraic rate, we prove convergence to the wave with asymptotic phase. The convergence holds in algebraically weighted Sobolev norms and with an algebraic rate in time, where the asymptotic phase is approached by one order less than the profile. On the technical side we use the theory of exponential trichotomies to separate the spatial modes into growing, weakly decaying, and strongly decaying ones. This allows us to derive resolvent and semigroup estimates in weighted Sobolev norms and to close the argument with a Gronwall lemma involving algebraic weights.</description>

      <title>The 2D Gray-Scott system of equations: constructive proofs of existence of localized stationary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a method to perform constructive proofs of existence of smooth planar localized patterns in the Gray-Scott model. Specifically, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l$ for the study of systems of autonomous semi-linear PDEs, on which products and differential operators are well-defined. Then, given an approximate solution $\mathbf{u}_0$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\mathbf{u}_0$. In particular, we derive a condition under which we prove the existence of a unique solution in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{u}_0$. Such a condition can be verified thanks to the explicit computation of different upper bounds, for which analytical details are presented. Furthermore, we provide an extra condition under which localized patterns are proven to be the limit of an unbounded branch of (spatially) periodic solutions as the period tends to infinity. We then demonstrate our approach by proving (constructively) the existence of four different localized patterns in the 2D Gray-Scott model. In addition, these solutions are proven to satisfy the $D_4$-symmetry. That is, the symmetry of the square. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs are available at \cite{julia_cadiot_blanco_GS}.</description>

      <title>On weak inverse mean curvature flow and Minkowski-type inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a proper weak solution $\{ \Omega_{t} \}_{0 \leq t &lt; \infty}$ to inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3\leq n \leq 7$, is smooth and star-shaped by the time
  \begin{equation*}
  T= (n-1) \log \left( \frac{\text{sinh} \left( r_{+} \right)}{ \text{sinh} \left( r_{-} \right)} \right), \end{equation*} where $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$ are the geodesic out-radius and in-radius of the initial domain $\Omega_{0}$. The argument is inspired by the Alexandrov reflection method for extrinsic curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ due to Chow-Gulliver and uses a result of Li-Wei.
  As applications, we extend the Minkowski inequalities of Brendle-Hung-Wang and De Lima-Girao to outer-minimizing domains $\Omega_{0} \subset \mathbb{H}^{n}$ in these dimensions. From this, we also extend the asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian Penrose inequality to balanced asymptotically hyperbolic graphs over the exteriors of outer-minimizing domains of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3 \leq n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>On the mass transfer in the 3D Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a micro-scale model of superfluidity derived by Pitaevskii in 1959 which describes the interacting dynamics between superfluid He-4 and its normal fluid phase. This system consists of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the incompressible, inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations, coupled to each other via a bidirectional nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The coupling permits mass/momentum/energy transfer between the phases, and accounts for the conversion of superfluid into normal fluid. We prove the existence of weak solutions in $\mathbb{T}^3$ for a power-type nonlinearity, beginning from small initial data. The main challenge is to control the inter-phase mass transfer in order to ensure the strict positivity of the normal fluid density, while obtaining time-independent a priori estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study an inverse boundary value problem for the biharmonic operator with first order perturbation. Our geometric setting is that of a bounded simply connected domain in the Euclidean space of dimension three or higher. Assuming that the inaccessible portion of the boundary is flat, and we have knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the complement, we prove logarithmic type stability estimates for both the first and the zeroth order perturbation of the biharmonic operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of  two-dimensional interacting fermions submitted to a homogeneous transverse magnetic field. We consider a large magnetic field regime, with the gap between Landau levels set to the same order as that of potential energy contributions. Within the mean-field approximation, i.e. starting from Hartree's equation for the first reduced density matrix, we derive a drift equation for the particle density. We use vortex coherent states and the associated Husimi function to define a semi-classical density almost satisfying the limiting equation. We then deduce convergence of the density of the true Hartree solution by a Dobrushin-type stability estimate for the limiting equation.</description>

      <title>Discretisation of regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.02836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework allowing to apply the theory of regularity structures to discretisations of stochastic PDEs. The approach pursued in this article is that we do not focus on any one specific discretisation procedure. Instead, we assume that we are given a scale $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and a "black box" describing the behaviour of our discretised objects at scales below $\varepsilon $.</description>

      <title>Transforming Radical Differential Equations to Algebraic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithmic procedure that transforms, if possible, a given system of ordinary or partial differential equations with radical dependencies in the unknown function and its derivatives into a system with polynomial relations among them by means of a rational change of variables. The solutions of the given equation and its transformation correspond one-to-one. This work can be seen as a generalization of previous work on reparametrization of ODEs and PDEs with radical coefficients.</description>

      <title>Pickl's Proof of the Quantum Mean-Field Limit and Quantum Klimontovich Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the mean-field limit for the quantum dynamics of $N$ identical bosons in $\mathbf R^3$ interacting via a binary potential with Coulomb type singularity. Our approach is based on the theory of quantum Klimontovich solutions defined in [F. Golse, T. Paul, Commun. Math. Phys. 369 (2019), 1021-1053]. Our first main result is a definition of the interaction nonlinearity in the equation governing the dynamics of quantum Klimontovich solutions for a class of interaction potentials slightly less general than those considered in [T. Kato, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 70 (1951), 195-211]. Our second main result is a new operator inequality satisfied by the quantum Klimontovich solution in the case of an interaction potential with Coulomb type singularity. When evaluated on an initial bosonic pure state, this operator inequality reduces to a Gronwall inequality for a functional introduced in [P. Pickl, Lett. Math. Phys. 97 (2011), 151-164], resulting in a convergence rate estimate for the quantum mean-field limit leading to the time-dependent Hartree equation.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions in a chamfered quarter of layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of a Laplace operator with mixed boundary conditions in an unbounded chamfered quarter of layer. This problem arises in the study of the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian in thick polyhedral domains having some symmetries such as the so-called Fichera layer. The geometry we consider depends on two parameters gathered in some vector $\kappa=(\kappa_1,\kappa_2)$ which characterizes the domain at the edges. By exchanging the axes and/or modifying their orientations if necessary, it is sufficient to restrict the analysis to the cases $\kappa_1\ge0$ and $\kappa_2\in[-\kappa_1,\kappa_1]$. We identify the essential spectrum and establish different results concerning the discrete spectrum with respect to $\kappa$. In particular, we show that for a given $\kappa_1&gt;0$, there is some $h(\kappa_1)&gt;0$ such that discrete spectrum exists for $\kappa_2\in[-\kappa_1,0)\cup(h(\kappa_1),\kappa_1]$ whereas it is empty for $\kappa_2\in[0,h(\kappa_1)]$. The proofs rely on classical arguments of spectral theory such as the max-min principle. The main originality lies rather in the delicate use of the features of the geometry.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the linearized Vlasov--Poisson equation around steady states from galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation in the gravitational case around steady states that are decreasing and continuous functions of the energy. We identify the absolutely continuous spectrum and give criteria for the existence of oscillating modes and estimate their number. Our method allows us to take into account an attractive external potential.</description>

      <title>A Bakry-\'Emery approach to Lipschitz transportation on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On weighted Riemannian manifolds we prove the existence of globally Lipschitz transport maps between the weight (probability) measure and log-Lipschitz perturbations of it, via Kim and Milman's diffusion transport map, assuming that the curvature-dimension condition $\mathrm{CD}(\rho_{1}, \infty)$ holds, as well as a second order version of it, namely $\Gamma_{3} \geq \rho_{2} \Gamma_{2}$. We get new results as corollaries to this result, as the preservation of Poincar\'e's inequality for the exponential measure on $(0,+\infty)$ when perturbed by a log-Lipschitz potential and a new growth estimate for the Monge map pushing forward the gamma distribution on $(0,+\infty)$ (then getting as a particular case the exponential one), via Laguerre's generator.</description>
