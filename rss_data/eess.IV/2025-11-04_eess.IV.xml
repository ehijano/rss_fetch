      <title>Towards Reliable Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation: Task-Specific nnU-Net Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring, yet faces unique challenges due to limited data, high anatomical variability, and heterogeneous imaging across institutions. In this work, we present an advanced nnU-Net framework tailored for BraTS 2025 Task-6 (PED), the largest public dataset of pre-treatment pediatric high-grade gliomas. Our contributions include: (1) a widened residual encoder with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention; (2) 3D depthwise separable convolutions; (3) a specificity-driven regularization term; and (4) small-scale Gaussian weight initialization. We further refine predictions with two postprocessing steps. Our models achieved first place on the Task-6 validation leaderboard, attaining lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.759 (CC), 0.967 (ED), 0.826 (ET), 0.910 (NET), 0.928 (TC) and 0.928 (WT).</description>

      <title>Investigating Label Bias and Representational Sources of Age-Related Disparities in Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic bias in medical imaging can perpetuate health disparities, yet its causes remain poorly understood in segmentation tasks. While fairness has been extensively studied in classification, segmentation remains underexplored despite its clinical importance. In breast cancer segmentation, models exhibit significant performance disparities against younger patients, commonly attributed to physiological differences in breast density. We audit the MAMA-MIA dataset, establishing a quantitative baseline of age-related bias in its automated labels, and reveal a critical Biased Ruler effect where systematically flawed labels for validation misrepresent a model's actual bias. However, whether this bias originates from lower-quality annotations (label bias) or from fundamentally more challenging image characteristics remains unclear. Through controlled experiments, we systematically refute hypotheses that the bias stems from label quality sensitivity or quantitative case difficulty imbalance. Balancing training data by difficulty fails to mitigate the disparity, revealing that younger patient cases are intrinsically harder to learn. We provide direct evidence that systemic bias is learned and amplified when training on biased, machine-generated labels, a critical finding for automated annotation pipelines. This work introduces a systematic framework for diagnosing algorithmic bias in medical segmentation and demonstrates that achieving fairness requires addressing qualitative distributional differences rather than merely balancing case counts.</description>

      <title>Image-based ground distance detection for crop-residue-covered soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation agriculture features a soil surface covered with crop residues, which brings benefits of improving soil health and saving water. However, one significant challenge in conservation agriculture lies in precisely controlling the seeding depth on the soil covered with crop residues. This is constrained by the lack of ground distance information, since current distance measurement techniques, like laser, ultrasonic, or mechanical displacement sensors, are incapable of differentiating whether the distance information comes from the residue or the soil. This paper presents an image-based method to get the ground distance information for the crop-residues-covered soil. This method is performed with 3D camera and RGB camera, obtaining depth image and color image at the same time. The color image is used to distinguish the different areas of residues and soil and finally generates a mask image. The mask image is applied to the depth image so that only the soil area depth information can be used to calculate the ground distance, and residue areas can be recognized and excluded from ground distance detection. Experimentation shows that this distance measurement method is feasible for real-time implementation, and the measurement error is within plus or minus 3mm. It can be applied in conservation agriculture machinery for precision depth seeding, as well as other depth-control-demanding applications like transplant or tillage.</description>

      <title>GDROS: A Geometry-Guided Dense Registration Framework for Optical-SAR Images under Large Geometric Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Registration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing images serves as a critical foundation for image fusion and visual navigation tasks. This task is particularly challenging because of their modal discrepancy, primarily manifested as severe nonlinear radiometric differences (NRD), geometric distortions, and noise variations. Under large geometric transformations, existing classical template-based and sparse keypoint-based strategies struggle to achieve reliable registration results for optical-SAR image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose GDROS, a geometry-guided dense registration framework leveraging global cross-modal image interactions. First, we extract cross-modal deep features from optical and SAR images through a CNN-Transformer hybrid feature extraction module, upon which a multi-scale 4D correlation volume is constructed and iteratively refined to establish pixel-wise dense correspondences. Subsequently, we implement a least squares regression (LSR) module to geometrically constrain the predicted dense optical flow field. Such geometry guidance mitigates prediction divergence by directly imposing an estimated affine transformation on the final flow predictions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three representative datasets WHU-Opt-SAR dataset, OS dataset, and UBCv2 dataset with different spatial resolutions, demonstrating robust performance of our proposed method across different imaging resolutions. Qualitative and quantitative results show that GDROS significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all metrics. Our source code will be released at: https://github.com/Zi-Xuan-Sun/GDROS.</description>

      <title>Been There, Scanned That: Nostalgia-Driven LiDAR Compression for Self-Driving Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An autonomous vehicle can generate several terabytes of sensor data per day. A significant portion of this data consists of 3D point clouds produced by depth sensors such as LiDARs. This data must be transferred to cloud storage, where it is utilized for training machine learning models or conducting analyses, such as forensic investigations in the event of an accident. To reduce network and storage costs, this paper introduces DejaView. Although prior work uses interframe redundancies to compress data, DejaView searches for and uses redundancies on larger temporal scales (days and months) for more effective compression. We designed DejaView with the insight that the operating area of autonomous vehicles is limited and that vehicles mostly traverse the same routes daily. Consequently, the 3D data they collect daily is likely similar to the data they have captured in the past. To capture this, the core of DejaView is a diff operation that compactly represents point clouds as delta w.r.t. 3D data from the past. Using two months of LiDAR data, an end-to-end implementation of DejaView can compress point clouds by a factor of 210 at a reconstruction error of only 15 cm.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Enhanced Vitreous OCT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate deep learning (DL) models for enhancing vitreous optical coherence tomography (OCT) image quality and reducing acquisition time. Methods: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPMs), Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (BBDMs), U-Net, Pix2Pix, and Vector-Quantised Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) were used to generate high-quality spectral-domain (SD) vitreous OCT images. Inputs were SD ART10 images, and outputs were compared to pseudoART100 images obtained by averaging ten ART10 images per eye location. Model performance was assessed using image quality metrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images and evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further tested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results: U-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM (0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest (3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and 85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous regions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10 B-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than ART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics and clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM showed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT images while reducing acquisition time fourfold. Translational Relevance: cDDPMs show promise for clinical integration, supporting faster, higher-quality vitreous imaging. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Video Quality Metrics for Neural and Traditional Codecs using 4K/UHD-1 Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With neural video codecs (NVCs) emerging as promising alternatives for traditional compression methods, it is increasingly important to determine whether existing quality metrics remain valid for evaluating their performance. However, few studies have systematically investigated this using well-designed subjective tests. To address this gap, this paper presents a subjective quality assessment study using two traditional (AV1 and VVC) and two variants of a neural video codec (DCVC-FM and DCVC-RT). Six source videos (8-10 seconds each, 4K/UHD-1, 60 fps) were encoded at four resolutions (360p to 2160p) using nine different QP values, resulting in 216 sequences that were rated in a controlled environment by 30 participants. These results were used to evaluate a range of full-reference, hybrid, and no-reference quality metrics to assess their applicability to the induced quality degradations. The objective quality assessment results show that VMAF and AVQBits|H0|f demonstrate strong Pearson correlation, while FasterVQA performed best among the tested no-reference metrics. Furthermore, PSNR shows the highest Spearman rank order correlation for within-sequence comparisons across the different codecs. Importantly, no significant performance differences in metric reliability are observed between traditional and neural video codecs across the tested metrics. The dataset, consisting of source videos, encoded videos, and both subjective and quality metric scores will be made publicly available following an open-science approach (https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/AVT-VQDB-UHD-1-NVC).</description>

      <title>Learned Adaptive Kernels for High-Fidelity Image Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image downscaling is a fundamental operation in image processing, crucial for adapting high-resolution content to various display and storage constraints. While classic methods often introduce blurring or aliasing, recent learning-based approaches offer improved adaptivity. However, achieving maximal fidelity against ground-truth low-resolution (LR) images, particularly by accounting for channel-specific characteristics, remains an open challenge. This paper introduces ADK-Net (Adaptive Downscaling Kernel Network), a novel deep convolutional neural network framework for high-fidelity supervised image downscaling. ADK-Net explicitly addresses channel interdependencies by learning to predict spatially-varying, adaptive resampling kernels independently for each pixel and uniquely for each color channel (RGB). The architecture employs a hierarchical design featuring a ResNet-based feature extractor and parallel channel-specific kernel generators, themselves composed of ResNet-based trunk and branch sub-modules, enabling fine-grained kernel prediction. Trained end-to-end using an L1 reconstruction loss against ground-truth LR data, ADK-Net effectively learns the target downscaling transformation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on standard benchmarks, including the RealSR dataset, demonstrate that ADK-Net establishes a new state-of-the-art in supervised image downscaling, yielding significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM metrics compared to existing learning-based and traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Which LiDAR scanning pattern is better for roadside perception: Repetitive or Non-repetitive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based roadside perception is a cornerstone of advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). While considerable research has addressed optimal LiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR scanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively under-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as traditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive (e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at varying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and overall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these differences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the "InfraLiDARs' Benchmark," a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation environment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting both scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate the impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D object detection algorithms. Our findings reveal that non-repetitive scanning LiDAR and the 128-line repetitive LiDAR were found to exhibit comparable detection performance across various scenarios. Despite non-repetitive LiDAR's limited perception range, it's a cost-effective option considering its low price. Ultimately, this study provides insights for setting up roadside perception system with optimal LiDAR scanning patterns and compatible algorithms for diverse roadside applications, and publicly releases the "InfraLiDARs' Benchmark" dataset to foster further research.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Generalizable Transfer Learning Method for Weather Condition Detection on Ground Terminals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of satellite Internet with low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites in mega-constellations allows ubiquitous connectivity to rural and remote areas. However, weather events have a significant impact on the performance and reliability of satellite Internet. Adverse weather events such as snow and rain can disturb the performance and operations of satellite Internet's essential ground terminal components, such as satellite antennas, significantly disrupting the space-ground link conditions between LEO satellites and ground stations. This challenge calls for not only region-based weather forecasts but also fine-grained detection capability on ground terminal components of fine-grained weather conditions. Such a capability can assist in fault diagnostics and mitigation for reliable satellite Internet, but its solutions are lacking, not to mention the effectiveness and generalization that are essential in real-world deployments. This paper discusses an efficient transfer learning (TL) method that can enable a ground component to locally detect representative weather-related conditions. The proposed method can detect snow, wet, and other conditions resulting from adverse and typical weather events and shows superior performance compared to the typical deep learning methods, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN, and R-YOLO. Our TL method also shows the advantage of being generalizable to various scenarios.</description>

      <title>OmniTrack++: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking by Learning Large-FoV Trajectory Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery, which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV), resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space, and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations, FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift. Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and +43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack. Datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/OmniTrack.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Multimodal Medical Imaging: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging relies heavily on large, labeled datasets. But, unfortunately, they are not always easily accessible in clinical settings. Additionally, many practitioners often face various structural obstacles like limited data availability, fragmented data systems, and unbalanced datasets. These barriers often lead to the increased diagnostic uncertainty, underrepresentation of certain conditions, reduced model robustness, and biased diagnostic decisions. In response to these challenges, approaches such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fusion have made great strides. However, they still need a solid theoretical justification for why they succeed or fail in situations where data is scarce. To address this gap, we propose a unified theoretical framework that characterizes learning and inference under low-resource medical imaging conditions. We first formalize the learning objective under few-shot conditions and compute sample complexity constraints to estimate the smallest quantity of data needed to achieve clinically reliable accuracy. Then based on ideas from PAC-learning and PAC-Bayesian theory, we explain how multimodal integration encourages generalization and quantifies uncertainty under sparse supervision. We further propose a formal metric for explanation stability, offering interpretability guarantees under low-data conditions. Taken together, the proposed framework establishes a principled foundation for constructing dependable, data-efficient diagnostic systems by jointly characterizing sample efficiency, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability in a unified theoretical setting.</description>

Abstract: Unlike fixed- or variable-rate image coding, progressive image coding (PIC) aims to compress various qualities of images into a single bitstream, increasing the versatility of bitstream utilization and providing high compression efficiency compared to simulcast compression. Research on neural network (NN)-based PIC is in its early stages, mainly focusing on applying varying quantization step sizes to the transformed latent representations in a hierarchical manner. These approaches are designed to compress only the progressively added information as the quality improves, considering that a wider quantization interval for lower-quality compression includes multiple narrower sub-intervals for higher-quality compression. However, the existing methods are based on handcrafted quantization hierarchies, resulting in sub-optimal compression efficiency. In this paper, we propose an NN-based progressive coding method that firstly utilizes learned quantization step sizes via learning for each quantization layer. We also incorporate selective compression with which only the essential representation components are compressed for each quantization layer. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher coding efficiency than the existing approaches with decreased decoding time and reduced model size.

      <title>FIPER: Factorized Features for Robust Image Super-Resolution and Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose using a unified representation, termed Factorized Features, for low-level vision tasks, where we test on Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) and \textbf{Image Compression}. Motivated by the shared principles between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine image details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing compressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of frequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in images, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the representation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized Features to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we further optimize the compression pipeline by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of our Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame compression. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.

      <title>LanPaint: Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting with Asymptotically Exact and Fast Conditional Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at joint pixel sampling for image generation but lack efficient training-free methods for partial conditional sampling (e.g., inpainting with known pixels). Prior work typically formulates this as an intractable inverse problem, relying on coarse variational approximations, heuristic losses requiring expensive backpropagation, or slow stochastic sampling. These limitations preclude: (1) accurate distributional matching in inpainting results, (2) efficient inference modes without gradient, (3) compatibility with fast ODE-based samplers. To address these limitations, we propose LanPaint: a training-free, asymptotically exact partial conditional sampling methods for ODE-based and rectified flow diffusion models. By leveraging carefully designed Langevin dynamics, LanPaint enables fast, backpropagation-free Monte Carlo sampling. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with precise partial conditioning and visually coherent inpainting across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Anatomically Guided Motion Correction for Placental IVIM Parameter Estimation with Accelerated Sampling Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method that may be applied to the placenta to help diagnose abnormal pregnancies. IVIM requires prolonged scan times, followed by a model-based estimation procedure. Maternal or fetal motion during the scan affects the accuracy of this estimation. In this work, we proposed to address this challenging motion correction and data fitting problem by using additional anatomical information that is routinely collected at the beginning of the examination. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) was applied to these anatomical data, to provide a patient-specific, 3D isotropic, anatomic reference. Our first contribution is a novel framework with a two-step motion correction that uses both IVIM and the SRR anatomic data, accounting for both intra- and inter-scan, non-rigid motion. Our second contribution is an automation and acceleration of the IVIM data fitting, using a state-of-the-art Bayesian-type algorithm, modified with a preconditioned Crank-Nicholson (pCN) sampling strategy. The accuracy of the IVIM parameter fitting was improved by the proposed motion correction strategy, as assessed by the mean absolute fitting error in the region of interest, which was 4.14 before and 3.02 after correction (arbitrary units of signal intensity). The novel sampling strategy accelerated parameter estimation by 39% in average, with the same accuracy as that of the conventional Bayesian approach. In conclusion, the proposed method may be applied to obtain fast and reliable IVIM parameter estimates in challenging scenarios such as prenatal MRI.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Glaucoma Calibration: Voting-Based Binocular and Metadata Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness, with significant diagnostic subjectivity. This inherent uncertainty, combined with the overconfidence of models optimized solely for accuracy can lead to fatal issues such as overdiagnosis or missing critical diseases. To ensure clinical trust, model calibration is essential for reliable predictions, yet study in this field remains limited. Existing calibration study have overlooked glaucoma's systemic associations and high diagnostic subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, we propose V-ViT (Voting-based ViT), a framework that enhances calibration by integrating a patient's binocular information and metadata. Furthermore, to mitigate diagnostic subjectivity, V-ViT utilizes an iterative dropout-based Voting System to maximize calibration performance. The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, including the primary calibration metrics. Our results demonstrate that V-ViT effectively resolves the issue of overconfidence in predictions in glaucoma diagnosis, providing highly reliable predictions for clinical use.

      <title>Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on four public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI, CT, and ultrasound videos. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.10 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, reducing the time required to correct propagated masks by 60.575% per volume compared to SAM 2, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.</description>

      <title>Autoadaptive Medical Segment Anything Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a key task in the imaging workflow, influencing many image-based decisions. Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated, domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything (SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines by double digits in limited label settings.

      <title>Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promising progress in lossless image compression. However, directly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suffers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based compressors often overlook the security of the compression process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this insight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first devised to partition the entire image into two segments, providing global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we innovatively propose a segmented message steganography algorithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of compression ratios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</description>

      <title>DMVFC: Deep Learning Based Functionally Consistent Tractography Fiber Clustering Using Multimodal Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore, microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) treat image matting and object segmentation as fundamentally different tasks. As improvements in image segmentation become increasingly challenging to achieve, combining image matting and grayscale segmentation techniques offers promising new directions for architectural innovation. Inspired by the possibility of aligning these two model tasks, we propose a new architectural approach for DIS called Confidence-Guided Matting (CGM). We created the first CGM model called Background Erase Network (BEN). BEN consists of two components: BEN Base for initial segmentation and BEN Refiner for confidence-based refinement. Our approach achieves substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods on the DIS5K validation dataset, demonstrating that matting-based refinement can significantly enhance segmentation quality. This work introduces a new paradigm for integrating matting and segmentation techniques, improving fine-grained object boundary prediction in computer vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in racing-related research is the lack of publicly available datasets containing raw images with corresponding annotations for the downstream task. In this paper, we introduce RoRaTrack, a novel dataset that contains annotated multi-camera image data from racing scenarios for track detection. The data is collected on a Dallara AV-21 at a racing circuit in Indiana, in collaboration with the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC). RoRaTrack addresses common problems such as blurriness due to high speed, color inversion from the camera, and absence of lane markings on the track. Consequently, we propose RaceGAN, a baseline model based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that effectively addresses these challenges. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art machine learning models in track detection. The dataset and code for this work are available at https://github.com/ghosh64/RaceGAN.</description>

      <title>Keep It Real: Challenges in Attacking Compression-Based Adversarial Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.</description>

      <title>SynBrain: Enhancing Visual-to-fMRI Synthesis via Probabilistic Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. Our code is available at https://github.com/MichaelMaiii/SynBrain.</description>
