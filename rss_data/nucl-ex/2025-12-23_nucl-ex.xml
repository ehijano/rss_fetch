      <title>First experimental determination of the $^{40}$Ar($n,2n$)$^{39}$Ar reaction cross section and $^{39}$Ar production in Earth's atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmogenic $^{39}$Ar(t$_{1/2}$= 268 years) isotope of argon is used for geophysical dating and tracing owing to its appropriate half-life and chemical inertness as a noble gas; $^{39}$Ar serves also in nuclear weapon test monitoring. We measured for the first time the total cross section of the main $^{39}$Ar cosmogenic production reaction in the atmosphere, namely $^{40}$Ar$(n,2n)^{39}$Ar, using 14.8$\pm0.3$ MeV neutrons. The neutrons, produced by a deuterium-tritium generator, impinged on a stainless steel sphere filled with Ar gas highly enriched in the $^{40}$Ar isotope. The reaction yield was measured by atom counting of $^{39}$Ar with noble gas accelerator mass spectrometry and, independently, by decay counting relative to atmospheric argon. A total $^{40}$Ar$(n,2n)^{39}$Ar cross section of 610$\pm100$ mb was determined. This result serves as a benchmark for recent theoretical calculations and evaluations, found to reproduce well the experimental total cross section. We use these energy-dependent theoretical cross sections together with experimental spectra of cosmogenic neutrons at different altitudes to calculate the global average rate of neutron-induced $^{39}$Ar atmospheric production, resulting in $770\pm240$ $^{39}$Ar atoms/cm$^2$/day. The secular equilibrium between the $^{39}$Ar calculated production rate and radioactive decay rate leads to a partial isotopic abundance $^{39}$Ar/Ar$= (5.9\pm 1.8) \times 10^{-16}$, showing that $\approx$73% of atmospheric $^{39}$Ar is produced by cosmogenic neutrons. The $^{40}$Ar($n,2n$)$^{39}$Ar cross section at 14 MeV is also a key parameter for quantifying the anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric $^{39}$Ar produced during the thermonuclear tests of the 1960s. We estimate that anthropogenic $^{39}$Ar accounts for roughly 20% of the present atmospheric inventory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is one of the largest underground physics laboratory, a very peculiar environment suited for experiments in Astroparticle Physics, Nuclear Physics and Fundamental Symmetries. The newly established Bellotti Ion Beam facility represents a major advance in the possibilities of studying nuclear processes in an underground environment. A workshop was organized at LNGS in the framework of the Nuclear Physics Mid Term Plan in Italy, an initiative of the Nuclear Physics Division of the Instituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare to discuss the opportunities that will be possible to study in the near future by employing state-of-the-art detection systems. In this report, a detailed discussion of the outcome of the workshop is presented.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Fifth- and Sixth-Order Fluctuations of (Net-)proton Number in Au+Au Collisions from Phase II of the Beam Energy Scan Program at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-statistics measurements of fifth- and sixth-order factorial cumulants and cumulant ratios of (net-)proton multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$--27 GeV, using data from the STAR experiment collected during the Beam Energy Scan Phase~II at RHIC. Protons and antiprotons are identified at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) with transverse momentum $0.4 &lt; p_T &lt; 2.0$ GeV/$c$. The proton factorial cumulants $\kappa_4$, $\kappa_5$, and $\kappa_6$ increase with order but exhibit no sign alternation within current uncertainties, offering no evidence for a two-component structure in the proton multiplicity distribution, as might be expected near a first-order phase transition. The cumulant ratios $C_{5}/C_{1}$ and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ fluctuate around zero in collisions at 0--40\% centrality. The results are consistent with both the negative predictions from lattice QCD (LQCD) and the positive trends obtained from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. At $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \gtrsim 27$ GeV, the $C_4/C_2$ and $C_5/C_1$ results are compatible with predictions from lattice QCD, functional renormalization group (FRG), and hadron resonance gas (HRG) models, while UrQMD describes the data better at lower energies. These measurements place constraints on baryon number fluctuations and offer valuable insights into the QCD phase structure.</description>

      <title>Toward an usage of americium-241 for filter calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nuclear safety and environmental studies, it is necessary to measure the activity of aerosols collected on filters. The calibration of these filters' measurement chains currently involves producing a reference filter with a controlled deposit of aerosol marked by a specific radionuclide. In France, commonly used radionuclides include 137 Cs for gamma or beta emitters, 90 Sr/ 90 Y for beta emitters, and 239 Pu for alpha emitters. However, using 239 Pu presents several issues, notably the destruction of the filter required to determine its traceable activity and the associated uncertainties. The challenge of this project is to propose a radionuclide enabling non-destructive, SI-traceable measurement while retaining the reference filter. The proposed radionuclide is 241 Am, which is both alpha and gamma-emitting and allows for precise non-destructive measurements. Reference filters are produced on the IRSN's ICARE test bench with calibrated aerosols tagged with 241 Am. The reference activity of theses filters is measured by gamma spectrometry on CEA/LNHB reference counter. A series of tests confirmed that 241 Am provides accurate activity determination with minimal uncertainty. Consequently, adopting 241 Am can significantly improve the reliability of radioactive contamination monitoring while avoiding practical challenges associated with plutonium.</description>

      <title>Dissociation driven quarkonium spin alignment in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of spin alignment of quarkonia in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides deep insight into the possible formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The present study investigates the spin alignment of quarkonia induced by dissociation mechanisms arising from medium effects imposed on quarkonia. We implement an effective Hamiltonian with a medium-modified color-singlet potential to incorporate the coupling of quarkonium spin with medium vorticity. This coupling gives rise to spin-dependent dissociation, which we identify as a plausible mechanism contributing to quarkonium spin alignment. Within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate the spin-dependent decay widths of charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S)) in a rotating thermal medium, including collisional damping and gluonic dissociation effects. We evaluate the observable $\rho_{00}$ for Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV as a function of transverse momentum of the quarkonia, charged particle multiplicity, and medium rotation. The results demonstrate that medium vorticity modifies the quarkonia net decay width and, as a consequence, quarkonia spin alignment gets modified. These findings suggest new directions for understanding spin transport and the microscopic dynamics of vortical QGP.</description>

      <title>Multi-neutron correlations in light nuclei via ab-initio lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform an uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\text{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, disfavoring sequential ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ decay and pointing towards direct $t+4n$ emission. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95% and 5% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Nuclear collectivity and the harmonic spectrum of two-body correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have opened a new experimental method to reveal collective behavior in nuclear ground states through the lens of many-body correlations of nucleons. Using ab initio lattice and variational calculations of $^{20}$Ne and $^{16}$O, we study how emergent phenomena such as deformation or clustering can be identified in these systems from the dependence of their two-body density distributions on the relative azimuthal angle of nucleon pairs. A harmonic analysis of the correlation functions reveals in particular a dominant quadrupole component in $^{20}$Ne, consistent with a bowling-pin picture, and a prominent triangular modulation in $^{16}$O, possibly indicative of alpha-cluster correlations. Given that such structures can be accurately identified in high-energy collider experiments, these findings open a new paradigm for analyzing emergent collective behavior in atomic nuclei, relating their intrinsic shapes to the harmonic spectrum of microscopic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hydrodynamic contributions to short-range two-particle correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using the Boltzmann-Langevin equation. We derive and solve the transport equation for equal-time two-point correlations, obtaining both local and non-local contributions that scale with transport coefficients. The non-local correlations emerging from 2-to-2 scattering dynamics provide a hydrodynamic signature in short-range correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Neutron star crust and outer core equation of state from chiral effective field theory with quantified uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the order-by-order expansion of the energy per particle of asymmetric nuclear matter up to twice saturation density in chiral effective field theory (EFT) within a Bayesian framework. For this, we develop a two-dimensional Gaussian process (2D GP) that is trained using many-body perturbation theory results based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions from leading to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO). This allows for an efficient evaluation of the equation of state (EOS) and thermodynamic derivatives with EFT truncation uncertainties. After benchmarking our 2D GP against Bayesian uncertainties for pure neutron matter and symmetric matter, we study the energy per particle, pressure, and chemical potentials of neutron star matter in $\beta$-equilibrium including EFT uncertainties. We investigate the phase diagram of neutron-rich matter from neutron- to proton-drip and to the uniform phase, including surface and Coulomb corrections. Based on this, we construct EOSs for the inner crust of neutron stars that are consistent with the chiral EFT results for uniform matter at N$^3$LO.</description>

      <title>Evidence of isospin-symmetry violation in high-energy collisions of atomic nuclei -- Supplementary Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration at the CERN SPS reported evidence of isospin-symmetry violation in high-energy nuclear collisions [Nature Communications 16, 2849 (2025)]. The effect was observed in the relative yields of charged and neutral kaons and cannot be explained by known sources of isospin symmetry breaking. In this work, we provide supplementary information on the theoretical aspects of that study. We discuss the historical background and introduce the concepts of isospin transformations and symmetry. Importantly, we relate isospin symmetry to the QCD flavour symmetry, and we present both conceptual and analytical proofs demonstrating the equality of the mean multiplicities of charged and neutral kaons for an initial ensemble of colliding systems that is invariant under charge-symmetry transformation.</description>

      <title>A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as a way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.</description>
