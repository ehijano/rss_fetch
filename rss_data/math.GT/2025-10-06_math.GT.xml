      <title>Generalised Kauffman Clock Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kauffman's clock theorem provides a distributive lattice structure on the set of states of a four-valent graph in the plane. We prove two distinct generalisations of this theorem, for four-valent graphs embedded in more general compact oriented surfaces. The proofs use results of Propp providing distributive lattice structures on matchings on bipartite plane graphs, and orientations of graphs with fixed circulation.</description>

      <title>Non-Simple knots in Contact 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new families of examples of non-simple prime Legendrian and transversal knots in tight Lens spaces, which demonstrate that the botany of Legendrians in Lens space is rich. In fact, there are more non-isotopic Legendrians that are topologically isotopic to the $n$-twist knot in a Lens space $L(\alpha, \beta)$ than in $S^3$. We also include connect sum formulas for rational variants of classical invariants, $\mathrm{tb}_\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathrm{rot}_\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathrm{sl}_\mathbb{Q}$, which indicate that prime knots are the right playground to look for exotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>A note on the topology of Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the first Betti number of a nontrivial genus-$g$ Lefschetz fibration. We also show that if the monodromy of a Lefschetz fibration is transitive with respect to the mapping class group, the Lefschetz fibration is simply connected. Lastly, we discuss a potential family of indecomposable genus-2 Lefschetz fibrations with maximally non-trivial first homology which would be candidates for large fundamental group computations, if they exist.</description>

      <title>The geometry of subgroups of mapping tori of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated mapping tori of free groups have a canonical collection of maximal sub-mapping tori of finitely generated free groups with respect to which they are relatively hyperbolic and locally relatively quasi-convex. As a consequence, we characterise locally quasi-convex hyperbolic groups amongst free-by-cyclic and one-relator groups. We also upgrade several known results for mapping tori of finitely generated free groups to the general case, such as the computations of Dehn functions, the solution to the conjugacy problem and the characterisation of the finitely generated intersection property.</description>

      <title>Nu-invariants of extra-twisted connected sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.16367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the possible ways of gluing twisted products of circles with asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds to produce manifolds with holonomy G_2, thus generalising the twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev and Corti, Haskins, Nordstr\"om, Pacini. We then express the extended nu-invariant of Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om arXiv:1505.02734 in terms of fixpoint and gluing contributions, which include different types of (generalised) Dedekind sums. Surprisingly, the calculations involve some non-trivial number-theoretical arguments connected with special values of the Dedekind eta-function and the theory of complex multiplication. One consequence of our computations is that there exist compact G_2-manifolds that are not G_2-nullbordant.</description>

      <title>On the Khovanov homology of 3-braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture of Przytycki and Sazdanovic that the Khovanov homology of the closure of a 3-stranded braid only contains torsion of order 2. This conjecture has been known for six out of seven classes in the Murasugi-classification of 3-braids and we show it for the remaining class. Our proof also works for the other classes and relies on Bar-Natan's version of Khovanov homology for tangles as well as his delooping and cancellation techniques, and the reduced integral Bar-Natan--Lee--Turner spectral sequence. We also show that the Knight-move conjecture holds for 3-braids.</description>

      <title>Schwarzian Bounds on Bending in Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative provides a classical analytic measure of how far a holomorphic map of the disk is from being M\"obius, with Nehari's bounds giving sharp criteria for univalence. Independently, Thurston introduced a geometric parametrization of locally univalent maps via bending measured laminations on the hyperbolic plane, capturing deviation from roundness in hyperbolic three-space. While both approaches quantify the same phenomenon, their precise relationship has remained only implicit. In this paper we establish explicit quantitative bounds relating the Schwarzian norm $\|Sf\|_\infty$ and the bending norm $\|\beta_f\|_L$. In particular, for univalent maps with $\|Sf\|_\infty&lt; 1/2$, we show that $\|\beta_f\|_L$ is controlled by an elementary function $B_L(\|Sf\|_L)$ that we compute explicitly. As an application, we obtain new effective bounds on the bending laminations of quasifuchsian manifolds in terms of the Teichm\"uller distance between their conformal boundary components. Our results sharpen the analytic-geometric correspondence between the Schwarzian derivative and hyperbolic geometry showing that just as small Schwarzian norm forces injectivity, it also forces controlled bending of convex hull boundaries.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors:
  First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time.
  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

      <title>Virtual fibring of manifolds and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topic of this survey is the phenomenon of fibring over the circle for manifolds, and its group-theoretic twin, algebraic fibring. We will discuss the state of the art, and explain briefly some of the ideas behind the more recent developments, focusing on RFRS groups and manifolds with such fundamental groups. Then we will move on to a more speculative part, where many conjectures about fibring in higher dimensions will be given. The conjectures vary in their level of plausibility, but even the boldest of them might share the fate of Thurston's Virtually Fibred Conjecture, about which Thurston famously said: ``This dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer''.</description>
