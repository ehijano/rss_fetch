      <title>Observation of the Einstein-de Haas Effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-de Haas effect is a phenomenon in which angular momentum is transferred from microscopic spins to mechanical rotation of a rigid body. Here, we report the first observation of the Einstein-de Haas effect in a spinor-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate where quantized vortices emerge in depolarized spinor components through coherent angular-momentum transfer from microscopic atomic spins to macroscopic quantized circulation. Experimental results clearly show that the spherical symmetry of the condensate is dynamically broken into the axisymmetry by an intrinsic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Programmable glassy dynamics using tunable disorder in tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics in ensembles of positionally disordered interacting quantum spins based on the statistical properties, such as mean and variance, of the underlying disorder distribution. Our framework is validated through extensive exact numerical calculations and we use it to disentangle and understand the importance of dimensionality and interaction range for the observation of glassy (i.e., sub-exponential) decay dynamics. Leveraging the deterministic control of qubit positioning enabled by modern tweezer array architectures, we also introduce a method (``J-mapping'') that can be used to emulate the relaxation dynamics of a disordered system with arbitrary dimensionality and interaction range in bespoke one-dimensional arrays. Our approach paves the way towards tunable relaxation dynamics that can be explored in quantum simulators based on arrays of neutral atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Bandstructure of a coupled BEC-cavity system: effects of dissipation and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a transversally driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. We focus on the interplay between different coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition, known as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band structure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions. By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Quasi-Particle Excitations in a Quantum Gas with Cavity-Mediated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative quantum systems can undergo transitions from stationary to dynamical phases, reflecting the emergence of collective non-equilibrium behavior. We study such a transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity and develop a cavity-assisted Bragg spectroscopy technique to resolve its collective modes. We observe dissipation-induced synchronization at the quasiparticle level, where two roton-like modes coalesce at an exceptional point. This reveals how dissipation microscopically drives collective dynamics and signals a precursor to a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</description>

      <title>Bosonic vs. Fermionic Matter in Quantum Simulations of $2+1$D Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>Mach-Zehnder atom interferometry with non-interacting trapped Bose Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent manipulation of a quantum wave is at the core of quantum sensing. For instance, atom interferometers require linear splitting and recombination processes to map the accumulated phase shift into a measurable population signal. Although Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) are the archetype of coherent matter waves, their manipulation between trapped spatial modes has been limited by the strong interparticle collisions. Here, we overcome this problem by using BECs with tunable interaction trapped in an innovative array of double-well potentials and exploiting quantum tunneling to realize linear beam splitting. We operate several Mach-Zehnder interferometers in parallel, canceling common-mode potential instabilities by a differential analysis, thus demonstrating a trapped-atom gradiometer. Furthermore, by applying a spin-echo protocol, we suppress additional decoherence sources and approach unprecedented coherence times of one second. Our interferometer will find applications in precision measurements of forces with a high spatial resolution and in linear manipulation of quantum entangled states for sensing with sub shot-noise sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation for almost-bosonic anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the $N$-body Hamiltonian describing the microscopic structure of a quantum gas of almost-bosonic anyons. This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \to \infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\pi\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\gamma$ which depends both on $\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\gamma=2\pi|\beta|$. Our findings confirm and clarify the predictions we have found in the physics literature.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Supersolid Order via Vortex Trajectory Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental exploration of supersolid regimes in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs that is applicable to large system sizes. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity even in the presence of dissipation. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions as experimental system sizes are increased.</description>

      <title>Paired Superfluidity and Quantum Quadruple Criticality in Synthetic-Dimension-Engineered Bose Mixtures: Phase-Dependent Demixing and Emergent XY Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to explore ground-state phases and demixing effects in synthetic-dimensional binary boson mixtures with pair hopping. Our investigation uncovers two exotic interspecies paired superfluids: (i) the PSCF phase, characterized by bosonic `four-particle' correlations (two particles of one species paired with two holes of the other), analogous to fermionic charge-4e superconductivity; (ii) the SCF$^*$ phase, hosting coexisting PSCF and super-counter-fluidity orders, serves as the bosonic analog of fermionic charge-2e/4e superconducting coexistence. Both phases exhibit distinct XY ferromagnetic states at varying fillings, including unreported pseudo-spin phases. A quantum quadruple critical point emerges under interexchange asymmetry. Crucially, pair hopping introduces phase-dependent mixed-demixed criticality, deviating from conventional two-component bosonic systems. We propose experimental protocols leveraging noise correlations and Feshbach resonance techniques to probe these states.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>

Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we analytically prove that the upper bound of the instantaneous power obtained through this system-charger duo scales quadratically with moderate system-size. By optimizing the driving frequency, we demonstrate that the maximum average power which is a lower bound of the instantaneous power can achieve the super-extensive scaling with system-size, thereby providing genuine quantum advantage. Further, we illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. We also discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

      <title>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</title>

Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>
