      <title>ANDES, the high resolution spectrograph for the ELT: science goals, project overview and future developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of ELT instruments includes an optical-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, indicated as ELT-HIRES and recently christened ANDES (ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph). ANDES consists of three fibre-fed spectrographs ([U]BV, RIZ, YJH) providing a spectral resolution of $\sim$100,000 with a minimum simultaneous wavelength coverage of 0.4-1.8 $\mu$m with the goal of extending it to 0.35-2.4 $\mu$m with the addition of a U arm to the BV spectrograph and a separate K band spectrograph. It operates both in seeing- and diffraction-limited conditions and the fibre feeding allows several, interchangeable observing modes including a single conjugated adaptive optics module and a small diffraction-limited integral field unit in the NIR. Modularity and fibre-feeding allow ANDES to be placed partly on the ELT Nasmyth platform and partly in the Coud\'e room. ANDES has a wide range of groundbreaking science cases spanning nearly all areas of research in astrophysics and even fundamental physics. Among the top science cases, there are the detection of biosignatures from exoplanet atmospheres, finding the fingerprints of the first generation of stars, tests on the stability of Nature's fundamental couplings, and the direct detection of the cosmic acceleration. The ANDES project is carried forward by a large international consortium, composed of 35 Institutes from 13 countries, forming a team of almost 300 scientists and engineers which include the majority of the scientific and technical expertise in the field that can be found in ESO member states.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Nonlinear Curvature Wavefront Sensor as a Function of Scintillation Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local amplitude aberrations caused by scintillation can impact the reconstruction process of a wavefront sensor (WFS) by inducing a spatially non-uniform intensity at the pupil plane. This effect is especially relevant for the commonly-used Shack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS), which can lose slope information for portions of the beam where the signal is faint, leading to reduced reconstruction performance and eventually total failure as the level of scintillation increases. An alternative WFS is needed for such conditions. The nonlinear curvature wavefront sensor (nlCWFS) has been shown to achieve better sensitivity compared to the SHWFS under low light levels. Additionally, the nlCWFS has demonstrated the ability to maintain its sensitivity in the presence of scintillation, using amplitude aberrations to help inform the reconstruction process, rather than hinder. Experiments to date have thus far only shown reconstruction results for a single scintillation value. Building upon previous simulations and laboratory experiments, we have built a testbed to quantify the effects of varying scintillation strength on the wavefront reconstruction performance of the nlCWFS compared to an equivalent SHWFS. In this paper, we present results showing the difference in performance between the nlCWFS and SHWFS as a function of relative flux and scintillation strength.</description>

      <title>The Smallsat Technology Accelerated Maturation Platform-1 (STAMP-1): A Proposal to Advance Ultraviolet Science, Workforce, and Technology for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Great Observatories Maturation Program (GOMAP) will advance the science definition, technology, and workforce needed for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) with the goal of a Phase A start by the end of the current decade. GOMAP offers long-term cost and schedule savings compared to the 'TRL 6 by Preliminary Design Review' paradigm historically adopted by large NASA missions. Many of the key technologies in the development queue for HWO require the combined activities of 1) facility and process development for validation of technologies at the scale required for HWO and 2) deployment in the 'real world' environment of mission Integration &amp; Test prior to on-orbit operations. We present a concept for the Smallsat Technology Accelerated Maturation Platform (STAMP), an integrated facility, laboratory, and instrument prototype development program that could be supported through the GOMAP framework and applied to any of NASA's Future Great Observatories (FGOs). This brief describes the recommendation for the first entrant into this program, "STAMP-1", an ESPA Grande-class mission advancing key technologies to enable the ultraviolet capabilities of HWO. STAMP-1 would advance new broadband optical coatings, high-sensitivity ultraviolet detector systems, and multi-object target selection technology to TRL 6 with a flight demonstration. STAMP-1 advances HWO technology on an accelerated timescale, building on current ROSES SAT+APRA programs, reducing cost and schedule risk for HWO while conducting a compelling program of preparatory science and workforce development with direct benefits for HWO mission implementation in the 2030s.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: A Minimum-Cost Matching Algorithm for Pairing Measured Resonances with Designed Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment currently being deployed to Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert of Chile. The initial deployment of SO, consisting of three 0.46m-diameter small-aperture telescopes and one 6m-primary large-aperture telescope, will field over 60,000 transition-edge sensors that will observe at frequencies between 30 GHz and 280 GHz. SO will read out its detectors using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) microwave-frequency multiplexing $\mu$mux, a form of frequency division multiplexing where an RF-SQUID couples each TES bolometer to a superconducting resonator tuned to a unique frequency. Resonator frequencies are spaced roughly every 2 MHz between 4 and 6 GHz, allowing for multiplexing factors on the order of 1000. One challenge of $\mu$mux is matching each tracked resonator with its corresponding physical detector. Variations in resonator fabrication, and frequency shifts between cooldowns caused by trapped flux can cause the measured resonance frequencies to deviate significantly from their designed values. In this study, we introduce a method for pairing measured and designed resonators by constructing a bipartite graph based on the two resonator sets, and assigning edge weights based on measured resonator and detector properties such as resonance frequency, detector pointing, and assigned bias lines. Finding the minimum-cost matching for a given set of edge weights is a well-studied problem that can be solved very quickly, and this matching tells us the best assignment of measured resonators to designed detectors for our input parameters. We will present results based on the first on-sky measurements from SAT1, the first SO MF small-aperture telescope.</description>

      <title>Centroiding and Extraction of Tip/Tilt Information from Nonlinear Curvature Wavefront Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear curvature wavefront sensor (nlCWFS) uses multiple (typically four) out-of-focus images to reconstruct the phase and amplitude of a propagating light beam. Because these images are located between the pupil and focal planes, they contain tip/tilt information. Rather than using a separate sensor to measure image locations, it would be beneficial to extract tip/tilt information directly and routinely as part of the reconstruction process. In the presence of atmospheric turbulence, recovering precise centroid offsets for each out-of-focus image becomes a dynamic process as image structure is altered by changing aberrations. We examine several tip/tilt extraction methods and compare their precision and accuracy using numerical simulations. We find that the nlCWFS outer measurement planes confer more accurate and reliable tip/tilt information than the inner measurement planes, due to their larger geometric lever arm. However, in practice, finite field of view (detector region of interest) effects bias tip/tilt retrieval when using the outer planes due to diffraction. Using knowledge of the $z$-distance to each plane, we find that applying a best-fit linear model to multiple image centroid locations can offer fast and accurate tip/tilt mode retrieval. For the most demanding applications, a non-linear tip/tilt extraction method that self-consistently uses the speckle field may need to be developed.</description>

      <title>Simulation results for Robo-AO-2 using HAPA: a wavefront sensing technique for improving the adaptive optics correction of fainter stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets allows us to measure positions and chemical signatures of exoplanets. Given the limited resources for space observations where the atmosphere is absent, we want to make these measurements from the ground. However, it is difficult from the ground because it requires an adaptive optics system to provide an extremely well corrected wavefront to enable coronographic techniques. Currently only natural guide star AO systems have demonstrated the necessary wavefront correction for direct imaging of exoplanets. However, using a stellar source as the guide star for wavefront sensing limits the number of exoplanet systems we can directly image because it requires a relatively bright V~10 mag star. To increase the number of observable targets, we need to push the limit of natural guide stars to fainter magnitudes with high Strehl ratio correction. We propose to combine laser guide star (LGS) and natural guide star (NGS) wavefront sensing to achieve the high Strehl correction with fainter natural guide stars. We call this approach Hybrid Atmospheric Phase Analysis (HAPA); 'hapa' in Hawaiian means 'half' or 'of mixed ethnic heritage'. The relatively bright LGS is used for higher order correction, whereas the NGS is used for high accuracy lower order correction. We focus on demonstrating this approach using Robo-AO-2 at the UH 2.2m telescope on Maunakea with a UV Rayleigh laser at 355 nm. The laser focuses at 10 km altitude and has an equivalent magnitude of m_U~8. In this report specifically, we present simulated results of HAPA employed at Robo-AO-2, with the LGS system having a single configuration of 16x16 subaperture Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and the NGS system having 6 different configurations -- 16x16, 8x8, 5x5, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. We also discuss the on-sky experiments we plan to carry out with HAPA at the UH 2.2m telescope.</description>

      <title>Prototyping liquid-crystal coronagraphs for exo-Earth imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents initial results from the ESA-funded ``SUPPPPRESS'' project, which aims to develop high-performance liquid-crystal coronagraphs for direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets in reflected light. The project focuses on addressing the significant challenge of polarization leakage in vector vortex coronagraphs (VVCs). We utilize newly manufactured multi-grating, liquid-crystal VVCs, consisting of a two- or three-element stack of vortex and grating patterns, to reduce this leakage to the $10^{-10}$ contrast level. We detail the experimental setups, including calibration techniques with polarization microscopes and Mueller matrix ellipsometers to enhance the direct-write accuracy of the liquid-crystal patterns. The performance testing of these coronagraph masks will be conducted on the THD2 high-contrast imaging testbed in Paris.</description>

      <title>Bayesian self-calibration and imaging in Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-calibration methods with the CLEAN algorithm have been widely employed in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data processing in order to correct antenna-based amplitude and phase corruptions present in the data. However, human interaction during the conventional CLEAN self-calibration process can impose a strong effective prior, which in turn may produce artifacts within the final image and hinder the reproducibility of final results. In this work, we aim to demonstrate a combined self-calibration and imaging method for VLBI data in a Bayesian inference framework. The method corrects for amplitude and phase gains for each antenna and polarization mode by inferring the temporal correlation of the gain solutions. We use Stokes I data of M87 taken with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43GHz, pre-calibrated using the rPICARD CASA-based pipeline. For antenna-based gain calibration and imaging, we use the Bayesian imaging software resolve. To estimate gain and image uncertainties, we use a Variational Inference method. We obtain a high-resolution M87 Stokes I image at 43GHz in conjunction with antenna-based gain solutions using our Bayesian self-calibration and imaging method. The core with counter-jet structure is better resolved, and extended jet emission is better described compared to the CLEAN reconstruction. Furthermore, uncertainty estimation of the image and antenna-based gains allows us to quantify the reliability of the result. Our Bayesian self-calibration and imaging method is able to reconstruct robust and reproducible Stokes I images and gain solutions with uncertainty estimation by taking into account the uncertainty information in the data.</description>

      <title>Athermal package for OH suppression filters in astronomy part 1: design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of an athermal package for fiber Bragg grating (FBG)filters fabricated at our Institute for use in ground-based near-infrared (NIR) telescopes. Aperiodic multichannel FBG filters combined with photonic lanterns can effectively filter out extremely bright atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) emission lines that severely hinder ground-based NIR observations. While FBGs have the capability of filtering specific wavelengths with high precision, due to their sensitivity to temperature variations, the success in their performance as OH suppression filters depends on a suitable athermal package that can maintain the deviations of the FBG wavelengths from that of the OH emission lines within sub-picometer accuracy over a temperature range of about 40 K. (i.e. 263 K to 303 K). We aim to develop an athermal package over the aforementioned temperature range for an optical fiber consisting of multichannel FBGs for a maximum filter length of 110 mm. In this work, we demonstrate the complete design methodology of such a package. First, we developed a custom-built test rig to study a wide range of critical physical properties of the fiber, such as strain and temperature sensitivities, elastic modulus, optimum fiber pre-tension, and adhesion performance.Next, we used these data to confirm the athermal response of an FBG bonded on the test rig from room temperature to 313 K. Based on this study, we developed a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the package and analyzed its athermal characteristics with a suitable selection of materials and their nominal dimensions using finite element analysis (FEA). We finally discuss the novel aspects of the design to achieve high-precision thermal stabilization of these filters in the temperature range of interest.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of line-of-sight velocity measurement of faint stars from low and medium resolution optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massively multiplexed spectrographs will soon gather large statistical samples of stellar spectra. The accurate estimation of uncertainties on derived parameters, such as line-of-sight velocity $v_\mathrm{los}$, especially for spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios, is paramount. We generated an ensemble of simulated optical spectra of stars as if they were observed with low- and medium-resolution fiber-fed instruments on an 8-meter class telescope, similar to the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph, and determined $v_\mathrm{los}$ by fitting stellar templates to the simulations. We compared the empirical errors of the derived parameters -- calculated from an ensemble of simulations -- to the asymptotic error determined from the Fisher matrix, as well as from Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior probability. We confirm that the uncertainty of $v_\mathrm{los}$ scales with the inverse square root of $S/N$, but also show how this scaling breaks down at low $S/N$ and analyze the error and bias caused by template mismatch. We outline a computationally optimized algorithm to fit multi-exposure data and provide the mathematical model of stellar spectrum fitting that maximizes the so called significance, which allows for calculating the error from the Fisher matrix analytically. We also introduce the effective line count, and provide a scaling relation to estimate the error of $v_\mathrm{los}$ measurement based on the stellar type. Our analysis covers a range of stellar types with parameters that are typical of the Galactic outer disk and halo, together with analogs of stars in M31 and in satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Identification of new gold lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region using laser produced plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a pilot study, using a laser-produced plasma, to identify new lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region for the r-process element gold (Au), of relevance to studies of neutron star mergers. This was achieved via optical-IR spectroscopy of a laser-produced Au plasma, with an Au target of high purity (99.95 %) and a low vacuum pressure to remove any air contamination from the experimental spectra. Our data were recorded with a spectrometer of 750 mm focal length and 1200 lines mm-1 grating, yielding a resolution of 0.04 nm. We find 54 lines not previously identified and which are not due to the impurities (principally copper (Cu) and silver (Ag)) in our Au sample. Of these 54 lines, we provisionally match 21 strong transitions to theoretical results from collisional-radiative models that include energy levels derived from atomic structure calculations up to the 6s level. Some of the remaining 33 unidentified lines in our spectra are also strong and may be due to transitions involving energy levels which are higher-lying than those in our plasma models. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that laser-produced plasmas are well suited to the identification of transitions in r-process elements, with the method applicable to spectra ranging from UV to IR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey (UVESS): A mission concept for probing the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2175 {\AA} bump shows considerable variations in its strength, width, and central wavelength when observed along different sightlines in the Milky Way and other galaxies. These variations offer valuable insights into the composition, size distribution, and processing of interstellar dust grains along different sightlines. This paper introduces a mission concept called UVESS (Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey) aimed at exploring the composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) within both the Milky Way and nearby Local Group Galaxies by mapping the variation of UV extinction curve slopes and the 2175 {\AA} feature across a majority of the sky to gain insights into the makeup of the ISM. Recent advancements in UV instrumentation and technologies pave the way for the development of high-throughput instruments in compact form factors. In this paper, we outline mission science goals and instrument concept tailored for a small satellite-based platform dedicated to the study of UV extinction.</description>

      <title>Systematic effects induced by half-wave plate differential optical load and TES nonlinearity for LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiteBIRD, a forthcoming satellite mission, aims to measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) across the entire sky. The experiment will employ three telescopes, Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers and rotating Half-Wave Plates (HWPs) at cryogenic temperatures to ensure high sensitivity and systematic effects mitigation. This study is focused on the Mid- and High-Frequency Telescopes (MHFT), which will use rotating metal mesh HWPs. We investigate how power variations due to HWP differential emissivity and transmittance combine with TES nonlinear responsivity, resulting in an effective instrumental polarization. We present the results of simulations for the current HWP design, modeling the TES deviation from linearity as a second-order response. We quantify the level of acceptable residual nonlinearity assuming the mission requirement on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $\delta r &lt; 0.001$. Moreover, we provide an accuracy requirement on the measurement of TES responsivity nonlinearity level for MHFT channels. Lastly, we present possible mitigation methods that will be developed in future studies.</description>

      <title>Optical alignment of contamination-sensitive Far-Ultraviolet spectrographs for Aspera SmallSat mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspera is a NASA Astrophysics Pioneers SmallSat mission designed to study diffuse OVI emission from the warm-hot phase gas in the halos of nearby galaxies. Its payload consists of two identical Rowland Circle-type long-slit spectrographs, sharing a single MicroChannel plate detector. Each spectrograph channel consists of an off-axis parabola primary mirror and a toroidal diffraction grating optimized for the 1013-1057 Angstroms bandpass. Despite the simple configuration, the optical alignment/integration process for Aspera is challenging due to tight optical alignment tolerances, driven by the compact form factor, and the contamination sensitivity of the Far-Ultraviolet optics and detectors. In this paper, we discuss implementing a novel multi-phase approach to meet these requirements using state-of-the-art optical metrology tools. For coarsely positioning the optics we use a blue-laser 3D scanner while the fine alignment is done with a Zygo interferometer and a custom computer-generated hologram. The detector focus requires iterative in-vacuum alignment using a Vacuum UV collimator. The alignment is done in a controlled cleanroom facility at the University of Arizona.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ultraviolet Detector Technology for future missions: Investigating the dark current plateau in silicon detectors using photon-counting EMCCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of high quantum efficiency silicon-based ultraviolet detectors, developed by the Microdevices Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is critical for current and proposed UV missions using these devices. In this paper, we provide an overview of our detector noise characterization test bench that uses delta-doped, photon counting, Electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs) to understand the fundamental noise properties relevant to all silicon CCDs and CMOS arrays. This work attempts to identify the source of the dark current plateau that has been previously measured with photon-counting EMCCDs and is known to be prevalent in other silicon-based arrays. It is suspected that the plateau could be due to a combination of detectable photons in the tail of blackbody radiation of the ambient instrument, low-level light leaks, and a non-temperature-dependent component that varies with substrate voltage. Our innovative test setup delineates the effect of the ambient environment during dark measurements by independently controlling the temperature of the detector and surrounding environment. We present the design of the test setup and preliminary results.</description>

      <title>A multi-functional fiber positioning system for Extremely Large Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conceptual design for a fiber positioning system for multi-object high-resolution spectroscopy, designed to be compatible with the upcoming large telescopes with a wide field of view. The design incorporates multiple Atmospheric Dispersion Correctors (ADCs) and tip-tilt mirrors that receive non-telecentric input from individual targets and direct it to the ADCs. Here, we introduce a mechanical design for the fiber positioner that accommodates the optics and operates in a curved focal plane with a Radius of Curvature (R) of 3m. This mechanical design provides four degrees of freedom to access the focal volume, enhancing targeting efficiency. The proposed design and an efficient target allocation algorithm ensure a targeting efficiency of approximately 80-100% for a primary observation session. We also present a methodology for target assignment, positioning, and quantification based on sequential and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms. This method has been tested on realistic fields with varying target densities to validate its performance.</description>

      <title>Visible Photonic Lantern integration, characterization and on-sky testing on Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Photonic Lantern (PL) is a novel device that efficiently converts a multi-mode fiber into several single-mode fibers. When coupled with an extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) system and a spectrograph, PLs enable high throughput spectroscopy at high angular resolution. The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system of the Subaru Telescope recently acquired a PL that converts its multi-mode input into 19 single-mode outputs. The single mode outputs feed a R~4,000 spectrograph optimized for the 600 to 760 nm wavelength range. We present here the integration of the PL on SCExAO, and study the device performance in terms of throughput, field of view, and spectral reconstruction. We also present the first on-sky demonstration of a Visible PL coupled with an ExAO system, showing a significant improvement of x12 in throughput compared to the use of a sole single-mode fiber. This work paves the way towards future high throughput photonics instrumentation at small angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Time Allocation and Long-Term Scheduling of ESO Telescopes at La Silla Paranal Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of the long-term telescope schedule follows the submission and scientific review of new proposals. At the European Southern Observatory (ESO) this process entails scheduling the scientific proposals according to their scientific merit and available observing resources, as well as scheduling technical, maintenance, and commissioning activities for all operational telescopes of the La Silla Paranal Observatory. After the recent overhaul of the phase 1 proposal submission software, ESO started the development of a new telescopes time allocation and scheduling tool. The new tool makes the scheduling process more efficient while optimising the use of observing facilities. Besides scheduling activities and allocating time according to scientific merit, available resources, operational and programmatic needs, the tool will enable simultaneous scheduling of multiple telescopes to appropriately account for dependencies between them. The implementation of this new Time Allocation tool opens the possibility for dynamic re-scheduling of the telescopes, which is a pre-requisite to implementing a "Yearly Call for Proposals" along with the "Fast Track Channel" at ESO.</description>

      <title>Best of both worlds: Fusing hyperspectral data from two generations of spectro-imagers for X-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the advent of microcalorimeter detectors, X-ray astrophysics is entering in a new era of spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy. But while this new generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as galaxy clusters of supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked best. After demonstrating a proof of concept in this article, we aim to apply this method to real X-ray astrophysical data in the near future.</description>

      <title>A fast frequency-domain expression for the time-dependent detector response of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to compact binary signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For proposed third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, whose sensitive bands are proposed to extend down to 5 Hz or below, the signals of low-mass compact binaries such as binary neutron stars remain in the detector's sensitive band long enough (up to a few days for the smallest proposed low-frequency cutoff of 1 Hz) that one cannot neglect the effects of the Earth's rotation on the detector's response and the changing Doppler shift of the signal. In the latter case, one also needs to consider the effects of the Earth's orbital motion, which is currently only included in analyses of compact binary signals using continuous wave techniques. These effects are also relevant for current detectors and signals from putative subsolar-mass binaries. Here we present simple Fourier series methods for computing these effects in the frequency domain, giving explicit expressions for the Earth's orbital motion in terms of low-order Fourier series, which will be sufficiently accurate for all compact binary signals except for those from very low-mass subsolar-mass binaries. The expression for the effects of the Earth's rotation on the antenna pattern functions does not use the stationary phase approximation (SPA), so we are able to show that the SPA is indeed quite accurate in these situations and present a Fourier series expression equivalent to it which is an order of magnitude faster. We also provide illustrations of these effects on detector sensitivity and the accumulation of information about various binary parameters with frequency.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Milky Way dust extinction curve in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar dust is a major foreground contaminant for many observations and a key component in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, yet its properties remain highly uncertain. Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure the extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million stars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map its variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented detail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain growth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher densities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming regions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds, or by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.</description>

      <title>The SHERLOCK pipeline: new exoplanet candidates in the WASP-16, HAT-P-27, HAT-P-26, and TOI-2411 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launches of NASA Kepler and TESS missions have significantly enhanced the interest in the exoplanet field during the last 15 years, providing a vast amount of public data that is being exploited by the community thanks to the continuous development of new analysis tools. However, using these tools is not straightforward, and users must dive into different codes, input-output formats, and methodologies, hindering an efficient and robust exploration of the available data. We present the SHERLOCK pipeline, an end-to-end public software that allows the users to easily explore observations from space-based missions such as TESS or Kepler to recover known planets and candidates issued by the official pipelines and search for new planetary candidates that remained unnoticed. The pipeline incorporates all the steps to search for transit-like features, vet potential candidates, provide statistical validation, conduct a Bayesian fitting, and compute observational windows from ground-based observatories. Its performance is tested against a catalog of known and confirmed planets from the TESS mission, trying to recover the official TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), explore the existence of companions that have been missed, and release them as new planetary candidates. SHERLOCK demonstrated an excellent performance, recovering 98% of the TOIs and confirmed planets in our test sample and finding new candidates. Specifically, we release four new planetary candidates around the systems WASP-16 (with P$\sim$10.46 d and R$\sim$2.20 $R_\oplus$), HAT-P-27 (with P$\sim$1.20 d and R$\sim$4.33 $R_\oplus$), HAT-P-26 (with P$\sim$6.59 d and R$\sim$1.97 $R_\oplus$), and TOI-2411 (with P$\sim$18.75 d and R$\sim$2.88 $R_\oplus$).</description>

      <title>Astronomy's relationship with the lands and communities of Maunakea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy is at a turning point in its history and in its relations with the Indigenous peoples who are the generational stewards of land where several of our main observatories are located. The controversy regarding the further development of astronomy facilities on Maunakea is probably the most significant and publicized conflict about the use of such land in the name of science. Thousands have stood in resistance, elders were arrested, and the community is divided. Astronomy's access to one of its most emblematic sites is at risk. This situation challenges our professional practice, the projects we build on Indigenous lands, and our relationships with the people who live within these lands and with society in general. This paper attempts to share the perspective of the authors on the historical events, including the very recent past, through the lens of our understanding and opinions; to provide transparency, with humility, into our process of introspection and transformation; and to share our hopes and ambitions as leaders from Maunakea Observatories for the future of astronomy in Hawai'i, as advocated by the Astro2020 report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; and to suggest ways for the profession to commit to this long-term vision.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Tension Statistics using Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fits of the same physical model to two different datasets disagree, we call this tension. Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied researchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been proposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting assumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to successfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used metric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely adopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it has a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for properly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio Estimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic example, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument~(DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey~(SDSS). We find no significant tension between DESI and SDSS.</description>

      <title>Estimating Probability Densities with Transformer and Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are often the go-to architecture to build foundation models that ingest a large amount of training data. But these models do not estimate the probability density distribution when trained on regression problems, yet obtaining full probabilistic outputs is crucial to many fields of science, where the probability distribution of the answer can be non-Gaussian and multimodal. In this work, we demonstrate that training a probabilistic model using a denoising diffusion head on top of the Transformer provides reasonable probability density estimation even for high-dimensional inputs. The combined Transformer+Denoising Diffusion model allows conditioning the output probability density on arbitrary combinations of inputs and it is thus a highly flexible density function emulator of all possible input/output combinations. We illustrate our Transformer+Denoising Diffusion model by training it on a large dataset of astronomical observations and measured labels of stars within our Galaxy and we apply it to a variety of inference tasks to show that the model can infer labels accurately with reasonable distributions.</description>

      <title>Neural-based Video Compression on Solar Dynamics Observatory Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission collects extensive data to monitor the Sun's daily activity. In the realm of space mission design, data compression plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by limited telemetry rates. The primary objective of data compression is to facilitate efficient data management and transmission to work within the constrained bandwidth, thereby ensuring that essential information is captured while optimizing the utilization of available resources. This paper introduces a neural video compression technique that achieves a high compression ratio for the SDO's image data collection. The proposed approach focuses on leveraging both temporal and spatial redundancies in the data, leading to a more efficient compression. In this work, we introduce an architecture based on the Transformer model, which is specifically designed to capture both local and global information from input images in an effective and efficient manner. Additionally, our network is equipped with an entropy model that can accurately model the probability distribution of the latent representations and improves the speed of the entropy decoding step. The entropy model leverages a channel-dependent approach and utilizes checkerboard-shaped local and global spatial contexts. By combining the Transformer-based video compression network with our entropy model, the proposed compression algorithm demonstrates superior performance over traditional video codecs like H.264 and H.265, as confirmed by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a Longwave HgCdTe GeoSnap Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New longwave HgCdTe detectors are critical to upcoming plans for ground-based infrared astronomy. These detectors, with fast-readouts and deep well-depths, will be key components of extremely large telescope instruments and therefore must be well understood prior to deployment. We analyze one such HgCdTe detector, a Teledyne Imaging Sensors GeoSnap, at the University of Michigan. We find that the properties of the GeoSnap are consistent with expectations from analysis of past devices. The GeoSnap has a well-depth of 2.75 million electrons per pixel, a read noise of 360 e-/pix, and a dark current of 330,000 e-/s/pix at 45 K. The device experiences 1/f noise which can be mitigated relative to half-well shot noise with modest frequency image differencing. The GeoSnap's quantum efficiency is calculated to be 79.7 +- 8.3 % at 10.6 microns. Although the GeoSnap's bad pixel fraction, on the order of 3%, is consistent with other GeoSnap devices, close to a third of the bad pixels in this detector are clustered in a series of 31 "leopard" spots spread across the detector plane. We report these properties and identify additional analyses that will be performed on future GeoSnap detectors.</description>

      <title>nuance: Efficient detection of planets transiting active stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of planetary transits in the light curves of active stars, featuring correlated noise in the form of stellar variability, remains a challenge. Depending on the noise characteristics, we show that the traditional technique that consists of detrending a light curve before searching for transits alters their signal-to-noise ratio, and hinders our capability to discover exoplanets transiting rapidly-rotating active stars. We present nuance, an algorithm to search for transits in light curves while simultaneously accounting for the presence of correlated noise, such as stellar variability and instrumental signals. We assess the performance of nuance on simulated light curves as well as on the TESS light curves of 438 rapidly-rotating M dwarfs. For each dataset, we compare our method to 5 commonly-used detrending techniques followed by a search with the Box-Least-Square algorithm. Overall, we demonstrate that nuance is the most performant method in 93% of cases, leading to both the highest number of true positives and the lowest number of false positive detections. Although simultaneously searching for transits while modeling correlated noise is expected to be computationally expensive, we make our algorithm tractable and available as the JAX-powered Python package nuance, allowing its use on distributed environments and GPU devices. Finally, we explore the prospects offered by the nuance formalism, and its use to advance our knowledge of planetary systems around active stars, both using space-based surveys and sparse ground-based observations.</description>

      <title>The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS): Asteroid Population Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS) is a ZTF and Rubin Observatory alert broker that will send alerts to the community regarding interesting events in the Solar System. SNAPS is actively monitoring Solar System objects and one of its functions is to compare objects (primarily main belt asteroids) to one another to find those that are outliers relative to the population. In this paper, we use the SNAPShot1 dataset which contains 31,693 objects from ZTF and derive outlier scores for each of these objects. SNAPS employs an unsupervised approach; consequently, to derive outlier rankings for each object, we propose four different outlier metrics such that we can explore variants of outlier scores and add confidence to outlier rankings. We also provide outlier scores for each object in each permutation of 15 feature spaces, between 2 and 15 features, which yields 32,752 total feature spaces. We show that we can derive population outlier rankings each month at Rubin Observatory scale using four Nvidia A100 GPUs, and present several avenues of scientific investigation that can be explored using population outlier detection.</description>

      <title>NICER timing of the X-ray thermal isolated neutron star RX J0806.4--4123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.</description>
