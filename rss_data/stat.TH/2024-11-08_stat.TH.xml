      <title>Adaptive signal recovery in sparse nonparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe an unknown regression function of $d$ variables $f(\boldsymbol{t})$, $\boldsymbol{t} \in[0,1]^d$, in the Gaussian white noise model of intensity $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We assume that the function $f$ is regular and that it is a sum of $k$-variate functions, where $k$ varies from $1$ to $s$ ($1\leq s\leq d$). These functions are unknown to us and only few of them are nonzero. In this article, we address the problem of identifying the nonzero components of $f$ in the case when $d=d_\varepsilon\to \infty$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $s$ is either fixed or $s=s_\varepsilon\to \infty$, $s=o(d)$ as $\varepsilon\to \infty$. This may be viewed as a variable selection problem. We derive the conditions when exact variable selection in the model at hand is possible and provide a selection procedure that achieves this type of selection. The procedure is adaptive to a degree of model sparsity described by the sparsity parameter $\beta\in(0,1)$. We also derive conditions that make the exact variable selection impossible. Our results augment previous work in this area.</description>

      <title>Testing for changes in the error distribution in functional linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear models with scalar responses and covariates from a separable Hilbert space. The aim is to detect change points in the error distribution, based on sequential residual empirical distribution functions. Expansions for those estimated functions are more challenging in models with infinite-dimensional covariates than in regression models with scalar or vector-valued covariates due to a slower rate of convergence of the parameter estimators. Yet the suggested change point test is asymptotically distribution-free and consistent for one-change point alternatives. In the latter case we also show consistency of a change point estimator.</description>

      <title>Kernel density estimation with polyspherical data and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kernel density estimator for data on the polysphere $\mathbb{S}^{d_1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{S}^{d_r}$, with $r,d_1,\ldots,d_r\geq 1$, is presented in this paper. We derive the main asymptotic properties of the estimator, including mean square error, normality, and optimal bandwidths. We address the kernel theory of the estimator beyond the von Mises-Fisher kernel, introducing new kernels that are more efficient and investigating normalizing constants, moments, and sampling methods thereof. Plug-in and cross-validated bandwidth selectors are also obtained. As a spin-off of the kernel density estimator, we propose a nonparametric $k$-sample test based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Numerical experiments illuminate the asymptotic theory of the kernel density estimator and demonstrate the superior performance of the $k$-sample test with respect to parametric alternatives in certain scenarios. Our smoothing methodology is applied to the analysis of the morphology of a sample of hippocampi of infants embedded on the high-dimensional polysphere $(\mathbb{S}^2)^{168}$ via skeletal representations ($s$-reps).</description>

      <title>Conjugate gradient methods for high-dimensional GLMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are a widely used tool in statistical analysis. The main bottleneck of many computational approaches lies in the inversion of the high dimensional precision matrices associated with the random effects. Such matrices are typically sparse; however, the sparsity pattern resembles a multi partite random graph, which does not lend itself well to default sparse linear algebra techniques. Notably, we show that, for typical GLMMs, the Cholesky factor is dense even when the original precision is sparse. We thus turn to approximate iterative techniques, in particular to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. We combine a detailed analysis of the spectrum of said precision matrices with results from random graph theory to show that CG-based methods applied to high-dimensional GLMMs typically achieve a fixed approximation error with a total cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters and observations. Numerical illustrations with both real and simulated data confirm the theoretical findings, while at the same time illustrating situations, such as nested structures, where CG-based methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust inference with censoring unbiased transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends doubly robust censoring unbiased transformations to a broad class of censored data structures under the assumption of coarsening at random and positivity. This includes the classic survival and competing risks setting, but also encompasses multiple events. A doubly robust representation for the conditional bias of the transformed data is derived. This leads to rate double robustness and oracle efficiency properties for estimating conditional expectations when combined with cross-fitting and linear smoothers. Simulation studies demonstrate favourable performance of the proposed method relative to existing approaches. An application of the methods to a regression discontinuity design with censored data illustrates its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Dynamic Quantile Model Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:1602.00856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel dynamic framework to Bayesian model averaging for time-varying parameter quantile regressions. By employing sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo, we combine empirical estimates derived from dynamically chosen quantile regressions, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the quantile model instabilities. The effectiveness of our methodology is initially validated through the examination of simulated datasets and, subsequently, by two applications to the US inflation rates and to the US real estate market. Our empirical findings suggest that a more intricate and nuanced analysis is needed when examining different sub-period regimes, since the determinants of inflation and real estate prices are clearly shown to be time-varying. In conclusion, we suggest that our proposed approach could offer valuable insights to aid decision making in a rapidly changing environment.</description>

      <title>The ODE Method for Asymptotic Statistics in Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14427v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concerns the $d$-dimensional stochastic approximation recursion, $$ \theta_{n+1}= \theta_n + \alpha_{n + 1} f(\theta_n, \Phi_{n+1}) $$ where $ \{ \Phi_n \}$ is a stochastic process on a general state space, satisfying a conditional Markov property that allows for parameter-dependent noise. The main results are established under additional conditions on the mean flow and a version of the Donsker-Varadhan Lyapunov drift condition known as (DV3):
  {(i)} An appropriate Lyapunov function is constructed that implies convergence of the estimates in $L_4$.
  {(ii)} A functional central limit theorem (CLT) is established, as well as the usual one-dimensional CLT for the normalized error. Moment bounds combined with the CLT imply convergence of the normalized covariance $\textsf{E} [ z_n z_n^T ]$ to the asymptotic covariance in the CLT, where $z_n{=:} (\theta_n-\theta^*)/\sqrt{\alpha_n}$.
  {(iii)} The CLT holds for the normalized version $z^{\text{PR}}_n{=:} \sqrt{n} [\theta^{\text{PR}}_n -\theta^*]$, of the averaged parameters $\theta^{\text{PR}}_n {=:} n^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n\theta_k$, subject to standard assumptions on the step-size. Moreover, the covariance in the CLT coincides with the minimal covariance of Polyak and Ruppert.
  {(iv)} An example is given where $f$ and $\bar{f}$ are linear in $\theta$, and $\Phi$ is a geometrically ergodic Markov chain but does not satisfy (DV3). While the algorithm is convergent, the second moment of $\theta_n$ is unbounded and in fact diverges.
  {\bf This arXiv version 3 represents a major extension of the results in prior versions.} The main results now allow for parameter-dependent noise, as is often the case in applications to reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid t-tests and confidence sequences for Gaussian means with unknown variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03722v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1976, Lai constructed a nontrivial confidence sequence for the mean $\mu$ of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Curiously, he employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper (flat) mixture over $\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not yield an "e-process" (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null, as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting confidence sequences, which have a curious polynomial dependence on the error probability $\alpha$ that we prove to be not only unavoidable, but (for universal inference) even better than the classical fixed-sample t-test. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and contrast the various approaches, including some recent suboptimal ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decision-making, maxitive functions are used for worst-case and best-case evaluations. Maxitivity gives rise to a rich structure that is well-studied in the context of the pointwise order. In this article, we investigate maxitivity with respect to general preorders and provide a representation theorem for such functionals. The results are illustrated for different stochastic orders in the literature, including the usual stochastic order, the increasing convex/concave order, and the dispersive order.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study discrete quasi-copulas associated with imprecise copulas. We focus on discrete imprecise copulas that are in correspondence with the Alternating Sign Matrices and provide some construction techniques of dual pairs. Additionally, we show how to obtain (full-domain) self-dual imprecise copulas through patchwork techniques. We further investigate the properties of the constructed dual pairs and prove that they are coherent and avoid sure loss.</description>

      <title>Using negative controls to identify causal effects with invalid instrumental variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many proposals for the identification of causal effects require an instrumental variable that satisfies strong, untestable unconfoundedness and exclusion restriction assumptions. In this paper, we show how one can potentially identify causal effects under violations of these assumptions by harnessing a negative control population or outcome. This strategy allows one to leverage sup-populations for whom the exposure is degenerate, and requires that the instrument-outcome association satisfies a certain parallel trend condition. We develop the semiparametric efficiency theory for a general instrumental variable model, and obtain a multiply robust, locally efficient estimator of the average treatment effect in the treated. The utility of the estimators is demonstrated in simulation studies and an analysis of the Life Span Study.</description>

      <title>A class of sparse Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms and analysis of their extreme singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in modern algorithm design. The lemma states that any set of high-dimensional points in a Euclidean space can be flattened to lower dimensions while approximately preserving pairwise Euclidean distances. Random matrices satisfying this lemma are called JL transforms (JLTs). Inspired by existing $s$-hashing JLTs with exactly $s$ nonzero elements on each column, the present work introduces an ensemble of sparse matrices encompassing so-called $s$-hashing-like matrices whose expected number of nonzero elements on each column is~$s$. The independence of the sub-Gaussian entries of these matrices and the knowledge of their exact distribution play an important role in their analyses. Using properties of independent sub-Gaussian random variables, these matrices are demonstrated to be JLTs, and their smallest and largest singular values are estimated non-asymptotically using a technique from geometric functional analysis. As the dimensions of the matrix grow to infinity, these singular values are proved to converge almost surely to fixed quantities (by using the universal Bai--Yin law), and in distribution to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) Tracy--Widom law after proper rescalings. Understanding the behaviors of extreme singular values is important in general because they are often used to define a measure of stability of matrix algorithms. For example, JLTs were recently used in derivative-free optimization algorithmic frameworks to select random subspaces in which are constructed random models or poll directions to achieve scalability, whence estimating their smallest singular value in particular helps determine the dimension of these subspaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback: from independence number to MAS number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider contextual bandits with graph feedback, a class of interactive learning problems with richer structures than vanilla contextual bandits, where taking an action reveals the rewards for all neighboring actions in the feedback graph under all contexts. Unlike the multi-armed bandits setting where a growing literature has painted a near-complete understanding of graph feedback, much remains unexplored in the contextual bandits counterpart. In this paper, we make inroads into this inquiry by establishing a regret lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{\beta_M(G) T})$, where $M$ is the number of contexts, $G$ is the feedback graph, and $\beta_M(G)$ is our proposed graph-theoretic quantity that characterizes the fundamental learning limit for this class of problems. Interestingly, $\beta_M(G)$ interpolates between $\alpha(G)$ (the independence number of the graph) and $\mathsf{m}(G)$ (the maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS) number of the graph) as the number of contexts $M$ varies. We also provide algorithms that achieve near-optimal regret for important classes of context sequences and/or feedback graphs, such as transitively closed graphs that find applications in auctions and inventory control. In particular, with many contexts, our results show that the MAS number essentially characterizes the statistical complexity for contextual bandits, as opposed to the independence number in multi-armed bandits.</description>
