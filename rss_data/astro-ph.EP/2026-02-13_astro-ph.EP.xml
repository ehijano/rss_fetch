      <title>Gas-depleted planet formation occurred in the four-planet system around the red dwarf LHS 1903</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small exoplanet radii show two populations, referred to as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, separated by a gap known as the radius valley. This may be produced by the removal of atmospheres due to stellar or internal heating, or lack of an initial envelope. We us transit photometry and radial velocity measurements to detect and characterize four planets orbiting LHS 1903, a red dwarf (M-dwarf) star in the Milky Way's thick disk. The planets have orbital periods between 2.2 and 29.3 days, and span the radius valley within a single planetary system. The derived densities indicate that LHS 1903 b is rocky, while LHS 1903 c and LHS 1903 d have extended atmospheres. Although the most distant planet from the host star, LHS 1903 e, has no gaseous envelope, indicating it formed from gas-depleted material.</description>

      <title>Revealing Exotic Nanophase Iron in Lunar Samples Through Impact-Driven Spatial Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophase iron (npFe) plays a crucial role in controlling the optical, chemical, and physical evolution of lunar regolith grains. While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from X.Zeng et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters. These contrasting spatial signatures provide a potential diagnostic criterion for distinguishing exotic versus in-situ np-Fe in returned lunar soils. In agreement with Chang'e-5 observations, our simulations demonstrate that exotic np-Fe production can be substantial, particularly in Fe-poor terrains such as highland regions. These findings highlight the need to account for exotic np-Fe when interpreting space weathering processes and remote-sensing data for the Moon and other airless bodies.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity Evolution of Warm Jupiters: The Role of Distant Perturbers and Nearby Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm Jupiters-giant exoplanets with orbital periods between 10 and 200 days-exhibit a broad range of eccentricities and are often accompanied by nearby low-mass planets. Understanding the origins of their orbital architectures requires examining both their migration histories and subsequent dynamical interactions. In this study, we perform extensive N-body simulations to explore how distant giant planet perturbers affect the eccentricity evolution of warm Jupiters and the role of nearby super-Earth companions in mediating these interactions. We find that while distant perturbers can induce large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations in warm Jupiters via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, the presence of nearby super-Earth companions often suppresses these variations via strong dynamical coupling. This mechanism naturally leads to a bimodal eccentricity distribution: warm Jupiters with nearby companions tend to maintain low eccentricities, whereas those without exhibit significantly broader eccentricity distributions. We show that reproducing the observed eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters lacking nearby companions is most naturally explained if a substantial fraction of distant perturbers occupy dynamically extreme orbits, either with large mutual inclinations or high orbital eccentricities. These results support a scenario in which warm Jupiters experience substantial post-disk dynamical evolution, shaped jointly by distant perturbers and nearby companions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Karin and Koronis2 asteroid families: new findings and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use our home catalog of the asteroid proper elements to study the Karin family. The hierarchical clustering method provides formal identification with 3,863 members, but this set also includes objects from the neighboring Koronis2 and Kuitaisi families, as well as interlopers originating from the much older Koronis family. By tracking the trajectories of cluster objects backward in time, we identified 2,161 asteroids whose orbits converged with that of their parent body (832) Karin at $5.72\pm 0.09$ My ago ($95$\% C.L.). This method of calculating the family's age is based on a novel convergence metric that is directly related to the velocities at which fragments were ejected from (832) Karin. We analyze the extent to which members $\leq 1.5$ km in diameter had drifted in semimajor axis due to Yarkovsky thermal forces and find it reflects the tilt of their rotation poles away from the ecliptic, recording the influence of the YORP torque. Karin's size frequency distribution in the $\simeq(0.8-3)$ km range follows a power-law with a cumulative slope index $-3.20\pm 0.01$. Removing members of the Karin family from the original group, we examine the Koronis2 family, whose members are associated with (158) Koronis. We find it difficult for large members of the Koronis2 family to converge with the orbit of (158) Koronis within its previously estimated age of $7.6$ My. Achieving such convergence would require the Koronis2 family to be older than $10$ My, but our result must be verified with a direct numerical approach in the future.</description>

      <title>An optical transient candidate of $\lesssim$ 2-second duration captured by wide-field video observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent time-domain surveys have revealed rapid transients that evolve on timescales of $\lesssim 10$ days, expanding the transient population into the short-duration regime. The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\mathrm{s} \leq \tau \lesssim 15~\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} \lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case. We highlight that continuous monitoring observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow could be a key strategy to unveil a new population of optical transients on timescales of seconds or less.</description>

      <title>Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. II. Vertical-net-flux regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a relatively well-ionised, turbulent active zone located interior to a poorly ionised 'dead' zone. In this second paper, we investigate a model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of discs threaded by a large-scale poloidal-net-flux magnetic field. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, the interface acts as a one-way barrier to inward transport of large-scale magnetic flux from the dead zone. This leads to magnetic flux depletion throughout most of the active zone, whereby it either advects inwards to the inner numerical boundary or accumulates just inside the interface. Second, two sources of strong variability emerge from the interface due to the difficulty of maintaining a constant, vertically integrated electrical current across distinct and evolving magnetic-field states. Third, despite the weak magnetothermal wind in the dead zone, a pressure maximum forms at the interface, leading to Rossby-wave-induced vortices. Fourth, unlike the model of Iwasaki et. al (2024), there is no 'transition zone' devoid of magnetic flux and magnetic winds. Instead, multiple outflow zones span all disc radii reflecting the radially varying launch conditions, with an inner turbulent wind impinging upon an outer, more laminar one. Fifth, a heated corona prevents the 'puffing up' of poloidal-net-flux, active disc regions.</description>

      <title>The Radius Cliff is a Waterfall: Explaining Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Steam Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demographics of Kepler planets provide a key testbed for models of planet formation and evolution, particularly for explaining the radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. A primordial interpretation based on differences in bulk densities -- where rocky and water-rich planets form via migration pathways -- offers an alternative to atmospheric loss scenarios. Updated interior structure models of water worlds with adiabatic steam atmospheres reproduce the observed valley near $\sim2~R_\oplus$ more accurately. Furthermore, migration models from our Genesis library suggest that these formation pathways can also account for the distinct period distributions of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, as well as the emergence of the hot Neptune desert. Motivated by this, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for close-in Kepler planets ($P&lt;100$ days), combining rocky planets and water worlds without H/He envelopes. The inferred mass distributions of rocky and water-rich planets peak at $\sim2.6~M_\oplus$ and $\sim7~M_\oplus$, respectively, with the water mass fraction of water worlds peaking at $\sim41\%$. Water worlds provide a good representation of the Kepler sub-Neptune population, with the radius cliff emerging as a ``waterfall" -- a sharp decline in their occurrence. However, our mass-radius analysis shows that water worlds alone cannot explain planets with $R \gtrsim 3~R_\oplus$, implying that at least $\sim20\%$ of sub-Neptunes in the sample are enriched in H/He gas.</description>

      <title>Velocities of Free Floaters in a Sea of Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (``free floaters'') through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Dielectric Properties of Juno's Regolith at One Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the modeling results of the thermal lightcurve of asteroid (3) Juno at the wavelength of $\lambda$ = 1.3 mm measured by the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array. A thermophysical model together with a radiative transfer model suggest a thermal inertia of 13$\pm$10 [J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.5}$], an equivalent emissivity of 0.8$\pm$0.1, a loss tangent of 0.4$\pm$0.3, and an index of refraction 1.8$\pm$0.3. Based on previous laboratory measurements, the modeled index of refraction suggests a regolith porosity of about 45%. However, thermal inertia models using the material parameters of ordinary chondrite indicate a grain size of 10s $\mu$m and require a high porosity of $\sim$90% to explain the low thermal inertia. In order to explain such a contradiction, we postulate that some repulsive mechanism might be in effect to reduce the contact of grains and therefore the thermal inertia. The loss tangent of Juno's regolith corrected for the modeled thermal skin depth is in the order of 0.5, much higher than that of the lunar regolith and indicating an electrical skin depth of L = 0.1 - 1.4 mm that is within the thermal skin depth. The shape of the rotational lightcurve of Juno in the mm wavelengths is dominated by its irregular shape, but rotational variations in the thermal and/or dielectric properties cannot be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that mm-wavelength observations of asteroids provide an extra dimension of constraints to the porosity and grain size of asteroid regolith compared to the thermal infrared observations.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel finite-element methods for planetary gravitation: DtN and multipole expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson equation governing a planet's gravitational field is posed on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^3$, whereas finite-element computations require bounded meshes. We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling.</description>

      <title>Oxygen left behind: Atmospheric Enrichment due to Fractionation in Sub-Neptunes using BOREAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres is strongly influenced by atmospheric escape, particularly for close-in planets. Fractionation during atmospheric loss can preferentially remove lighter elements such as hydrogen, while retaining heavier species like oxygen. In this study, we investigate how and under what conditions hydrodynamic escape and chemical fractionation jointly shape the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, especially for mixed H2 + H2O atmospheres. We develop BOREAS, a self-consistent mass loss model coupling a 1D Parker wind formulation with a mass-dependent fractionation scheme, which we apply across a range of planet masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and incident XUV fluxes, allowing us to track hydrogen and oxygen escape rates at different snapshots in time. We find that oxygen is efficiently retained over most of the parameter space. Significant oxygen loss occurs under high incident XUV fluxes, while at intermediate fluxes oxygen loss is largely confined to low-gravity planets. Where oxygen is retained, irradiation is too weak to drive significant escape of hydrogen and thus limiting atmospheric enrichment. By contrast, our model predicts that sub-Neptunes undergo substantial atmospheric enrichment over approx. 200 Myr when hydrogen escape is efficient and accompanied by partial oxygen entrainment. Notably, our results imply that sub-Neptunes near the radius valley can evolve into water-rich planets, in agreement with GJ 9827 d. Present-day water-rich atmospheres may have originated from water-poor envelopes under some conditions, highlighting the need to include chemical fractionation in evolution models.

      <title>Tidal triggers and the predictability of solar activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline are currently considered to be one of the main determinants of solar activity. In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing. By contrast, the Carrington event (1959 September 1) does not fit this pattern.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the democratic detrender: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The democratic detrender allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. It then combines the individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized light curve. Additionally, the democratic detrender inflates each data point's uncertainty based on the scatter between detrenders, thereby propagating model-selection uncertainty into the final light curve. This ensemble strategy does not guarantee improvement over the single best-performing detrending method, but it substantially reduces the risk of selecting a detrending solution that is poorly calibrated or overfit to noise.</description>

      <title>Impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency on transit light-curves: A correction strategy for PLATO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than \(2\%\) via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardise this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assessed and quantified the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and developed a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we modelled the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and used least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)). Smearing was modelled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We modelled the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients (\(a_{p,k}\)), the well-fill power index (\(\beta\)), and the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)) were adjusted via an iterative application of the extended pixel edge response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induced a bias of about \(4\%\) in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of \(0.06\%\) after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derived a correction scheme that brought the photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.</description>

      <title>Zooming into the water snowline: high resolution water observations of the HL Tau disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water is one of the central molecules for the formation and habitability of planets. In particular, the region where water freezes-out, the water snowline, could be a favorable location to form planets in protoplanetary disks. We use high resolution ALMA observations to spatially resolve H$_2$O, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and SO emission in the HL Tau disk. A rotational diagram analysis is used to characterize the water reservoir seen with ALMA and compare this to the reservoir visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the H$_2$O 183 GHz line has a compact central component and a diffuse component that is seen out to ~75 au. A radially resolved rotational diagram shows that the excitation temperature of the water is ~350 K independent of radius. The steep drop in the water brightness temperature outside the central beam of the observations where the emission is optically thick is consistent with the water snowline being located inside the central beam ($\lesssim 6$ au) at the height probed by the observations. Comparing the ALMA lines to those seen at shorter wavelengths shows that only 0.02%-2% of the water reservoir is visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths, respectively, due to optically thick dust hiding the emission whereas 35-70% is visible with ALMA. An anti-correlation between the H$_2$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission is found but this is likely caused by optically thick dust hiding the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission in the disk center. Finally, we see SO emission tracing the disk and for the first time in SO a molecular outflow and the infalling streamer out to ~2". The velocity structure hints at a possible connection between the SO and the H$_2$O emission. Spatially resolved observations of H$_2$O lines at (sub-)mm wavelengths provide valuable constraints on the location of the water snowline, while probing the bulk of the gas-phase reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Sequential Fragmentation of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) After Its Near-Sun Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) reached perihelion at 0.33 au on 2025 October 8. Daily monitoring by the LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project revealed a major activity increase between November 2 and 4, accompanied by rapid changes in coma morphology. Serendipitous HST/STIS acquisition images obtained on November 8-10 captured the comet only days after this event and resolved five fragments, providing an early high-resolution view of a nucleus in the process of disruption. Fragment motions and morphologies indicate a hierarchical fragmentation sequence, including a slow secondary split of fragment II. Back extrapolation shows that both the primary and secondary breakups preceded their associated photometric outbursts by roughly one to three days. This consistent lag, together with the appearance of thin, short-lived arclets around fragment I in the first HST epoch, suggests that freshly exposed interior material warms rapidly but requires time before dust can be released efficiently. Given the comet's close perihelion passage, rotational instability driven by enhanced outgassing torques is a plausible contributor to nucleus disintegration and dust release, and may represent the primary source of the observed brightening. These combined ground- and space-based observations provide rare, time-resolved constraints on the thermal and structural evolution of a fragmented comet near perihelion and highlight the scientific value of capturing a nucleus within days of disruption, when thermal adjustment, dust mantle re-formation, and outgassing-driven torques jointly govern the onset of activity.</description>

      <title>The Astrometric Resoeccentric Degeneracy: Eccentric Single Planets Mimic 2:1 Resonant Planet Pairs in Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\mathrm{eff} = \, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.</description>

      <title>Efficient reduction of stellar contamination and noise in planetary transmission spectra using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: JWST has enabled transmission spectroscopy at unprecedented precision, but stellar heterogeneities (spots and faculae) remain a dominant contamination source that can bias atmospheric retrievals if uncorrected. Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The nature of ASASSN-24fw's occultation: modelling the event as dimming by optically thick rings around a sub-stellar companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.</description>
