      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Hidden order in dielectrics: string condensation, solitons, and the charge-vortex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Description of electrons in a dielectric as solitons of the polarization field requires that the interaction between the solitons (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism) is short-ranged. We present an analytical study of the mechanism by which this is achieved. The mechanism is unusual in that it enables screening of electrically neutral soliton cores by polarization charges. We also argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, which give rise to a topological contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.</description>
