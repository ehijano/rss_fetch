      <title>Parity-dependent state transfer for direct entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum information technologies advance they face challenges in scaling and connectivity. In particular, two necessities remain independent of the technological implementation: the need for connectivity between distant qubits and the need for efficient generation of entanglement. Perfect State Transfer is a technique which realises the time optimal transfer of a quantum state between distant nodes of qubit lattices with only nearest-neighbour couplings, hence providing an important tool to improve device connectivity. Crucially, the transfer protocol results in effective parity-dependent non-local interactions, extending its utility to the efficient generation of entangled states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Perfect State Transfer and the generation of multi-qubit entanglement on a chain of superconducting qubits. The system consists of six fixed-frequency transmon qubits connected by tunable couplers, where the couplings are controlled via parametric drives. By simultaneously activating all couplings and engineering their individual amplitudes and frequencies, we implement Perfect State Transfer on up to six qubits and observe the respective single-excitation dynamics for different initial states. We then apply the protocol in the presence of multiple excitations and verify its parity-dependent property, where the number of excitations within the chain controls the phase of the transferred state. Finally, we utilise this property to prepare a multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using only a single transfer operation, demonstrating its application for efficient entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Space and time correlations in quantum histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of generalized quantum histories allows a symmetrical treatment of space and time correlations, by taking different traces of the same history density matrix. We recall how to characterize spatial and temporal entanglement in this framework. An operative protocol is presented, to map a history state into the ket of a static composite system. We show, by examples, how the Leggett-Garg and the temporal CHSH inequalities can be violated in our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that several potentials proposed recently for the analysis of the vibrational-rotational spectra of diatomic molecules and their thermodynamic properties exhibit a flaw. One can easily show that the parameters $D_e $ and $r_e$ in those potentials are not the dissociation energy and equilibrium bond length, respectively, as the proposers believe. We show how to overcome the mistake in a simple and quite general way.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for tensor-SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising area of applications for quantum computing is in linear algebra problems. In this work, we introduce two new quantum t-SVD (tensor-SVD) algorithms. The first algorithm is largely based on previous work that proposed a quantum t-SVD algorithm for context-aware recommendation systems. The new algorithm however seeks to address and fix certain drawbacks to the original, and is fundamentally different in its approach compared to the existing work. The second algorithm proposed uses a hybrid variational approach largely based on a known variational quantum SVD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical entanglement induced by backward stimulated Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate robust optomechanical entanglement. This scheme is based on a Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process, which is hosted within an optomechanical structure. Our benchmark system consists of an acoustic (mechanical) mode coupled to two optical modes through the BSBS (radiation pressure) process. For a moderate values of the effective mechanical coupling, the BSBS induces a relatively weak entanglement. This entanglement is greatly enhanced, for at least up to one order of magnitude, when the mechanical coupling strength is strong enough. The generated entanglement is robust enough against thermal fluctuation. Our work provides a new scheme for entanglement generation based on BSBS effect, and can be extended to microwaves and hybrid optomechanical structures. Such a generated entangled states can be used for quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Qiskit Code Assistant: Training LLMs for generating Quantum Computing Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, revolutionizing the software development landscape by automating the coding process and reducing time and effort required to build applications. This paper focuses on training Code LLMs to specialize in the field of quantum computing. We begin by discussing the unique needs of quantum computing programming, which differ significantly from classical programming approaches or languages. A Code LLM specializing in quantum computing requires a foundational understanding of quantum computing and quantum information theory. However, the scarcity of available quantum code examples and the rapidly evolving field, which necessitates continuous dataset updates, present significant challenges. Moreover, we discuss our work on training Code LLMs to produce high-quality quantum code using the Qiskit library. This work includes an examination of the various aspects of the LLMs used for training and the specific training conditions, as well as the results obtained with our current models. To evaluate our models, we have developed a custom benchmark, similar to HumanEval, which includes a set of tests specifically designed for the field of quantum computing programming using Qiskit. Our findings indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in quantum computing tasks. We also provide examples of code suggestions, comparing our model to other relevant code LLMs. Finally, we introduce a discussion on the potential benefits of Code LLMs for quantum computing computational scientists, researchers, and practitioners. We also explore various features and future work that could be relevant in this context.</description>

      <title>Generating Einstein$\unicode{x2013}$Podolsky$\unicode{x2013}$Rosen correlations for teleporting collective spin states in a two dimensional trapped ion crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of phonon$\unicode{x2013}$mediated interactions as an entanglement resource to engineer Einstein$\unicode{x2013}$Podolsky$\unicode{x2013}$Rosen (EPR) correlations and to perform teleportation of collective spin states in two$\unicode{x2013}$dimensional ion crystals. We emulate continuous variable quantum teleportation protocols between subsystems corresponding to different nuclear spin degrees of freedom. In each of them, a quantum state is encoded in an electronic spin degree of freedom that couples to the vibrational modes of the crystal. We show that high fidelity teleportation of spin-coherent states and their phase-displaced variant, entangled spin-squeezed states, and Dicke states, is possible for realistic experimental conditions in arrays from a few tens to a few hundred ions.</description>

      <title>Optimal complexity of parameterized quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits play a key role for the development of quantum variational algorithms in the realm of the NISQ era. Knowing their actual capability of performing different kinds of tasks is then of the utmost importance. By comparing them with a prototypical class of universal random circuits we have found that their approach to the asymptotic complexity defined by the Haar measure is faster, needing less gates to reach it. Topology has been revealed crucial for this. The majorization criterion has proven as a relevant complementary tool to the expressibility and the mean entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum error detection with noise-resilient parity-controlled gate in two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error detection relies primarily on precise measurement of qubit parity, a fundamental operation in quantum information processing. Here, we introduce a resilient parity-controlled gate tailored for detecting quantum errors within a 2D Rydberg atom array. Our method enables the discrimination between even and odd parities of virtually excited control atoms by tracking the dynamic evolution of an auxiliary atom. Using spin-exchange dipolar interactions of Rydberg states and single- and two-photon driving between ground states and Rydberg states, our method speeds up Rydberg-parity measurements by a large amount compared to previous methods. In practical application, we explore three-qubit repetition codes, standard surface codes featuring stabilizers in the forms $ZZZZ$ and $XXXX$, as well as rotated surface codes in the $XZZX$ configuration, facilitating the measurement of stabilizers with a single-shot readout. We carry out thorough numerical simulations to evaluate the feasibility of our strategy, considering potential experimental imperfections such as undesired interactions between Rydberg states, fluctuations in atomic positions, dephasing noise, and laser amplitude inhomogeneities. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring the reliability and advantages of the physical mechanisms of the parity meter. These results affirm the robustness and viability of our protocol, positioning it as a promising candidate for quantum error detection employing the Rydberg atom system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithm for Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy in Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>The uncertainty of quantum states with respect to the projective measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty relation is a distinctive characteristic of quantum theory. The uncertainty is essentially rooted in quantum states. In this work we regard the uncertainty as an intrinsic property of quantum state and characterize it systematically with respect to given projective measurement. Some basic concepts about uncertainty are reformulated in this context. We prove and get the form of the uncertainty preserving operations. The quantum states with maximal uncertainty are characterized. A universal decomposition of uncertainty into classical uncertainty and quantum uncertainty is provided. Furthermore, a unified and general relation among uncertainty, coherence and coherence of assistance is established. These results are independent of any explicit uncertainty measure. At last, we propose a new uncertainty measure called the geometric uncertainty based on the fidelity and link it with the geometric coherence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Real-Time Thermal Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid Path Integral Monte Carlo (hPIMC) algorithm to calculate real-time quantum thermal correlation functions and demonstrate its application to open quantum systems. The hPIMC algorithm leverages the successes of classical PIMC as a computational tool for high-dimensional system studies by exactly simulating dissipation using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional on a classical computer. We achieve a quantum speed-up over the classical algorithm by computing short-time matrix elements of the quantum propagator on a quantum computer. We show that the component of imaginary-time evolution can be performed accurately using the recently developed Probabilistic Imaginary-Time Evolution (PITE) algorithm, and we introduce a novel low-depth circuit for approximate real-time evolution under the kinetic energy operator using a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). We test the accuracy of the approximation by computing the position-position thermal correlation function of a proton transfer reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic phase transitions and multistabilities in atom-cavity coupled systems have attracted tremendous interests recently. In this work, we investigate the effect of photon hopping between two Dicke cavities, which induces rich quantum phases for steady states and dynamic process. Starting from a generic dimer system where the two cavities are not necessarily identical, we analytically prove all possible steady-state phases, which are confirmed by numerical calculations. We then focus on the special case with two identical cavities, where all the steady states are confirmed by exact solutions. We show that photon hopping is a convenient and powerful tool to manipulate the quantum phases and induce multistable behavior in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced notion of tensor enumerator to the circuit enumerator. We provide a mathematical framework that offers a novel method for analyzing circuits and error models without resorting to Monte Carlo techniques. We introduce an analogue of the Poisson summation formula for stabilizer codes, facilitating a method for the exact computation of the number of error paths within the syndrome extraction circuit of the code that does not require direct enumeration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by explicitly providing the number of error paths in a distance five surface code under various error models, a task previously deemed infeasible via simulation. We also show our circuit enumerator is related to the process matrix of a channel through a type of MacWilliams identity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect on Genuine Tripartite Nonlocality and Entanglement in Quantum Dissipative System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a precious global resource in quantum information, genuine tripartite nonlocality(GTN) can be quantified by violating Svetlichny inequality. However, there is still no analytical expression for the general three-qubit states due to the difficulty of theoretical calculations. In this paper, we achieve highly accurate quantization of GTN for arbitrary three-qubit quantum states numerically. As an example, we study the dynamics of GTN and genuine tripartite entanglement(GTE) for the W state. Moreover, the complementarity of GTN is verified by examining the nonlocality between the tripartite and the bipartite. Finally, we also find a useful strategy to protect the correlation of GTN and GTE under decoherence by utilizing the Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum Visual Feature Encoding Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although quantum machine learning has been introduced for a while, its applications in computer vision are still limited. This paper, therefore, revisits the quantum visual encoding strategies, the initial step in quantum machine learning. Investigating the root cause, we uncover that the existing quantum encoding design fails to ensure information preservation of the visual features after the encoding process, thus complicating the learning process of the quantum machine learning models. In particular, the problem, termed "Quantum Information Gap" (QIG), leads to a gap of information between classical and corresponding quantum features. We provide theoretical proof and practical demonstrations of that found and underscore the significance of QIG, as it directly impacts the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a simple but efficient new loss function named Quantum Information Preserving (QIP) to minimize this gap, resulting in enhanced performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance compared to current methodologies and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in quantum modeling.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in Free Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been much explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of a MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcome the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to a MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law transition as the measurement strength is increased. Possible experimental relevance to levitated nanoparticle arrays is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Anisotropic Dicke-Stark Model with A-square terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superradiant phase transition (SRPT) is forbidden in the standard isotropic Dicke model due to the so-called no-go theorem induced by A-square term. In the framework of the Dicke model, we demonstrate that SRPTs can occur at both zero and finite temperatures if we intrinsically tune the rotating wave and count-rotating atom-cavity coupling independently, and/or introduce the nonlinear Stark coupling terms, thus overcoming the no-go theorem. The phase transitions in this so-called anisotropic Dicke-Stark model share the same universality class with the original Dicke model. The critical coupling strength of this model decreases with the isotropic constant gradually, but can be driven to zero quickly with the strong nonlinear Stark coupling. We believe that we have proposed a feasible scheme to observe the SRPT in the future solid-state experiments.</description>

      <title>Improving the Fidelity of CNOT Circuits on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an improved CNOT synthesis algorithm that considers nearest-neighbour interactions and CNOT gate error rates in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Compared to IBM's Qiskit compiler, it improves the fidelity of a synthesized CNOT circuit by about 2 times on average (up to 9 times). It lowers the synthesized CNOT count by a factor of 13 on average (up to a factor of 162).
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we define a $\textsf{Cost}$ function by approximating the average gate fidelity $F_{avg}$. According to the simulation results, $\textsf{Cost}$ fits the error probability of a noisy CNOT circuit, $\textsf{Prob} = 1 - F_{avg}$, much tighter than the commonly used cost functions. On IBM's fake Nairobi backend, it matches $\textsf{Prob}$ to within $10^{-3}$. On other backends, it fits $\textsf{Prob}$ to within $10^{-1}$. $\textsf{Cost}$ accurately quantifies the dynamic error characteristics and shows remarkable scalability. Second, we propose a noise-aware CNOT routing algorithm, NAPermRowCol, by adapting the leading Steiner-tree-based connectivity-aware CNOT synthesis algorithms. A weighted edge is used to encode a CNOT gate error rate and $\textsf{Cost}$-instructed heuristics are applied to each reduction step. NAPermRowCol does not use ancillary qubits and is not restricted to certain initial qubit maps. Compared with algorithms that are noise-agnostic, it improves the fidelity of a synthesized CNOT circuit across varied NISQ hardware. Depending on the benchmark circuit and the IBM backend selected, it lowers the synthesized CNOT count up to $56.95\%$ compared to ROWCOL and up to $21.62\%$ compared to PermRowCol. It reduces the synthesis $\textsf{Cost}$ up to $25.71\%$ compared to ROWCOL and up to $9.12\%$ compared to PermRowCol. Our method can be extended to route a more general quantum circuit, giving a powerful new tool for compiling on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations for overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of informationally overcomplete measurements. The existence of $d+1$ of mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Such measurements are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the measurements of interest, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

      <title>Implementation of B$^{\alpha}$ Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief report, we discuss the characteristics of B$^{\alpha}$ gates. We propose an experimental scheme to implement B$^{\alpha}$ gates in ion-trap system. In this scheme, we assume that only a single vibrational mode contributes to spin-spin coupling. This scheme is an extension of a recently proposed scheme to realize XY-type interaction in ion-trap system. With the successful implementation of this scheme, B$^{\alpha}$ gates can be used for doing quantum computation in ion-trap quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Spontaneous Emission for a giant driven $\Lambda $-type three-level atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics with giant atoms provides a new approach for implementing optical memory devices at the atomic scale. Here, we theoretically study the relaxation dynamics of a single driven three-level atom interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide, via two coupling points. Under certain conditions, after the long-time dynamics, we found that the population of giant atom can either maintain stable values or exhibit regular periodic oscillation behavior, while photons can be trapped in the region of giant atoms. This phenomenon is not achievable using a two-level atom with two legs. It is worth noting that the atomic excitation probability of a stable bound state is a constant value, which is determined by the size of the atom. Crucially, the size of the atom (the distance between the two coupling points) is much larger than the wavelength of the light field, which is a necessary condition for the existence of oscillating bound states.</description>

      <title>Comparison of non-decoy single-photon source and decoy weak coherent pulse in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in practical single-photon sources (SPS) exhibiting high brightness and low $g^{(2)}(0)$ have garnered significant interest for their application in quantum key distribution (QKD). To assess their QKD performance, it is essential to compare them with the widely employed weak coherent pulses (WCPs) in the decoy state method. In this work, we analyze the non-decoy efficient BB84 protocol for an SPS, partially characterising its photon statistics by its $g^{(2)}(0)$ and mean photon number. We compare it to the 2-decoy efficient BB84 with WCPs within the finite-key analysis framework while optimizing the parameters of both protocols. Our findings indicate that the non-decoy SPS with a mean photon number of $\langle n \rangle = 0.5$ and $g^{(2)}(0) = 3.6\%$ can enhance the secure key generation over the 2-decoy WCP for block sizes under $4.66 \cdot 10^9$ sent signals ($29$ seconds of acquisition time) at a channel loss of $10$ dB ($52.5$ km of optical fibre). Additionally, we demonstrate an increase in the maximum tolerable channel loss for SPSs with mean photon number $\langle n \rangle \geq 0.0142$ at block sizes below $10^8$ sent signals ($0.62$ seconds of acquisition time). These results suggest that SPSs hold potential for key rate enhancement in short-range QKD networks, though further research is required to evaluate their key generation capabilities when integrated into the decoy method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed bipartite quantum systems subject to fast local unitary control are studied using quantum optimal control theory and a method of reduced control systems based on the Schmidt decomposition. Particular focus is given to the time-optimal generation of maximally entangled states and product states, as well as to the problem of stabilizing quantum states with a certain amount of entanglement. Explicit analytical solutions are given for general systems consisting of two qubits (as well as for bosonic and fermionic analogues) and also for a class of systems consisting of two coupled qutrits which is studied using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle.</description>

      <title>Higher-order incompatibility improves distinguishability of causal quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that incompatible ``higher-order quantum theoretic testing procedures", known as quantum testers, perform better in distinguishing causal quantum networks than its compatible counterparts. To demonstrate our finding, we consider a specific two-party quantum comb discrimination (QCD) game based on the task in which a receiver gets a black-box that implements a quantum comb and they attempt to determine which comb it implements based on prior information. We show that the receiver does better at winning the game when they have exclusive access to incompatible testers over compatible ones. Our investigation generalises the earlier finding that the incompatibility of POVMs is a {\em bona fide} resource in quantum state distinguishability. We also show that any quantum resource in testers is useful in comb exclusion tasks using the resource measure, {\em convex weight}.</description>

      <title>Few-Photon SUPER: Quantum emitter inversion via two off-resonant photon modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the realization of controlled quantum systems, exploring excitations beyond the resonant case opens new possibilities. We investigate an extended Jaynes-Cummings model where two photon modes are coupled off-resonantly to a quantum emitter. This allows us to identify few-photon scattering mechanisms that lead to a full inversion of the emitter while transferring off-resonant photons from one mode to another. This behaviour connects to recent measurements of a two-level emitter scattering two off-resonant photons simultaneously. Furthermore, our results can be understood as quantized analogue of the recently developed off-resonant quantum control scheme known as Swing-UP of quantum EmitteR (SUPER). Our intuitive formalism gives a deeper insight into the interaction of a two-level emitter with off-resonant light modes with the prospect of novel photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating pump harmonics generation in a SNAIL-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) are extensively employed in experiments involving weak microwave signals for their highly desirable quantum-limited and broadband characteristics. However, TWPAs' broadband nature comes with the disadvantage of admitting the activation of spurious nonlinear processes, such as harmonics generation, that can potentially degrade amplification performance. Here we experimentally investigate a Josephson TWPA device with SNAIL (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive Element)-based unit cells focusing on the amplification behaviour along with the generation of second and third harmonics of the pump. By comparing experimental results with transient numerical simulations, we demonstrate the influence of Josephson junctions' fabrication imperfections on the occurrence of harmonics and on the gain behaviour.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a type of phase transition in quantum many-body systems, which occurs in highly excited quantum many-body scar states, while the rest of the spectrum is largely unaffected. Such scar state phase transitions can be realized by embedding a matrix product state, known to undergo a phase transition, as a scar state into the thermal spectrum of a parent Hamiltonian. We find numerically that the mechanism for the scar state phase transition involves the formation or presence of low-entropy states at energies similar to the scar state in the vicinity of the phase transition point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monogamy of nonlocality is one the most intriguing and cryptographically significant predictions of quantum theory. The physical principle of information causality offers a promising means to understand and restrict the extent of nonlocality without invoking the abstract mathematical formalism of quantum theory. In this article, we demonstrate that the original bipartite formulation of information causality cannot imply non-trivial monogamy relations, thereby refuting the previous claims. Nevertheless, we show that the recently proposed multipartite formulation of information causality implies stronger-than-no-signaling monogamy relations. We use these monogamy relations to enhance the security of device-independent quantum key distribution against a no-signaling eavesdropper constrained by information causality.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of quantum theory as games between physicists and nature played in Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, we introduced games in Minkowski spacetime as a generalization of game theory to special relativity that subsumes games in normal form (spacelike separation) and games in extensive form (timelike separation). Many concepts including Nash equilibria naturally extend to spacetime games. We also emphasized the importance of these games to model quantum experiments such as Bell experiments and more generally any adaptive measurements. Subsequent work suggested to formalize a special case of such games in terms of strategy presheaves. In the case that measurements have a unique causal bridge and if a natural cover is taken, we show that the two frameworks are isomorphic to each other and provide complementary perspectives. Spacetime games provide a visual and intuitive framework that also captures the distinction between joint experiments and either-or experiments, so that they are rich enough in their causal structure to imply a natural cover for the corresponding causal contextuality scenario. Based on this observation, we suggest to define the strategy presheaf directly based on the pure strategies (and restrictions thereof) of the spacetime game, and we show that the sheaf property obtains for the games at hand. The argument is rather simple and similar to event sheaves for the flat case. Finally, we explain how, in the other direction, the failure of the sheaf property on strategy distribution presheaves is consistent with our previous argument that Nash game theory is not compatible with quantum physics. This shows that the insights of the two frameworks, taken together, can contribute positively to the advancement of the field of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Repeated measurements and random scattering in quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of random scattering in quantum walks on a finite graph and compare it with the effect of repeated measurements. To this end, a constructive approach is employed by introducing a localized and a delocalized basis for the underlying Hilbert space. This enables us to design Hamiltonians whose eigenvectors are either localized or delocalized. By presenting some specific examples we demonstrate that the localization of eigenvectors restricts the transition probabilities on the graph and leads to dark states in the monitored evolution. We conclude that repeated measurements as well as random scattering provide efficient tools for controlling quantum walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of a controllable decoherence-assisted quantum key distribution scheme. Our method is based on the possibility of introducing controllable decoherence to polarization qubits using the spatial degree of freedom of light. We show that our method reduces the amount of information that an eavesdropper can obtain in the BB84 protocol under the entangling probe attack. We demonstrate experimentally that Alice and Bob can agree on a scheme to that gives low values of the quantum bit error rate, despite the presence of a large amount of decoherence in the transmission channel of the BB84 protocol.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the presentation and evaluation of the high-level quantum programming language Eclipse Qrisp. The presented framework, used for developing and compiling quantum algorithms, is measured in terms of efficiency for its implementation of the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Module. We measure this efficiency and compare it against two alternative QAOA algorithm implementations using IBM's Qiskit toolkit. The evaluation process has been carried out over a benchmark composed of 15 instances of the well-known Maximum Cut Problem. Through this preliminary experimentation, Eclipse Qrisp demonstrated promising results, outperforming both versions of its counterparts in terms of results quality and circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Enhanced Emission and Absorption of Color Centers in a Diamond Membrane With Selectable Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group IV color centers in diamond are among the most promising optically active spin systems with strong optical transitions and long spin coherences. The ground-state splitting of the center is particularly important to suppress the interaction with coherence-limiting phonons, which improves the coherence properties and sets the upper limit for the operating temperature. Negatively charged silicon-vacancy centers have an ordinary ground-state splitting of only 48GHz, resulting in required temperatures below one Kelvin, which can only be achieved by dilution refrigerators. Here, we increase the ground-state splitting by up to an order of magnitude by induced strain in a single-crystal diamond membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate cavity-assisted spectroscopy enabled by coupling the emitter ensemble with a selectable strain to the mode of a Fabry-Perot microcavity. Calculation of the absorption cross-section yields $\sigma_{ens} = $4.9*10^-11 cm^2. Together with the Purcell-enhanced twofold reduction in emitter lifetime below 1ns, this makes the system a promising spin-photon interface at moderate temperatures of 4K.</description>

      <title>Novel oracle constructions for quantum random access memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel ways of designing quantum (random access) memory, also known as quantum dictionary encoders or data-access oracles. More precisely, given a function, $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_2^d$, we construct oracles, $\mathcal{O}_f$, with the property $\mathcal{O}_f |x\rangle_n |0\rangle_d = |x\rangle_n |f(x)\rangle_d$. Our constructions are based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform of $f$, viewed as an integer valued function. In general, the complexity of our method scales with the sparsity of the Walsh--Hadamard transform and not the sparsity of $f$, yielding more favorable constructions in cases such as binary optimization problems and function with low-degree Walsh--Hadamard Transforms. Our design comes with a tuneable amount of ancillas that can trade depth for size. In the ancillas-free design, these oracles can be $\epsilon$-approximated so that the Clifford $+$ $T$ depth is $O \left( \left( n + \log_2\left( \tfrac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \right) \mathcal{W}_f \right)$, where $\mathcal{W}_f$ is the number of nonzero components in the Walsh--Hadamard Transform. The depth of the shallowest design is $O \left( \log_2 \left( \mathcal{W}_f \right) + \log_2 \left( \tfrac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \right)$, using $n + d \mathcal{W}_f$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Training-efficient density quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning requires powerful, flexible and efficiently trainable models to be successful in solving challenging problems. In this work, we present density quantum neural networks, a learning model incorporating randomisation over a set of trainable unitaries. These models generalise quantum neural networks using parameterised quantum circuits, and allow a trade-off between expressibility and efficient trainability, particularly on quantum hardware. We demonstrate the flexibility of the formalism by applying it to two recently proposed model families. The first are commuting-block quantum neural networks (QNNs) which are efficiently trainable but may be limited in expressibility. The second are orthogonal (Hamming-weight preserving) quantum neural networks which provide well-defined and interpretable transformations on data but are challenging to train at scale on quantum devices. Density commuting QNNs improve capacity with minimal gradient complexity overhead, and density orthogonal neural networks admit a quadratic-to-constant gradient query advantage with minimal to no performance loss. We conduct numerical experiments on synthetic translationally invariant data and MNIST image data with hyperparameter optimisation to support our findings. Finally, we discuss the connection to post-variational quantum neural networks, measurement-based quantum machine learning and the dropout mechanism.</description>

      <title>A relativistic statistical field theory on a discretized Minkowski lattice with quantum-like observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic statistical field theory is constructed for a fluctuating complex-valued scalar field on a discretized Minkowski lattice. A Hilbert space of observables is then constructed from functionals of the fluctuating complex-valued scalar field with an inner product defined in terms of expectation values of the functionals. A bosonic Fock space is then constructed from the Hilbert space and creation and annihilation operators that act on the Fock space are defined. The creation and annihilation operators are used to define field operators. These field operators have some interesting quantum-like properties. For example, the field operators do not commute in general and, in the particular case of the free field theory, can be shown to satisfy the microcausality condition.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free many-body Hamiltonians in nonlinear waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing interactions in many-body quantum systems, while protecting them from environmental decoherence, is at the heart of many quantum technologies. Waveguide quantum electrodynamics is a promising platform for achieving this, as it hosts infinite-range interactions and decoherence-free subspaces of quantum emitters. However, as coherent interactions between emitters are typically washed out in the wavelength-spacing regime hosting decoherence-free states, coherent control over the latter becomes limited, and many-body Hamiltonians in this important regime remain out of reach. Here we show that by incorporating emitter arrays with nonlinear waveguides hosting parametric gain, we obtain a unique class of many-body interaction Hamiltonians with coupling strengths that increase with emitter spacing, and persist even for wavelength-spaced arrays. We then propose to use these Hamiltonians to coherently generate decoherence-free states directly from the ground state, using only global squeezing drives, without the need for local addressing of individual emitters. Interestingly, we find that the dynamics approaches a unitary evolution in the limit of weak intra-waveguide squeezing, and discuss potential experimental realizations of this effect. Our results pave the way towards coherent control protocols in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, with applications including quantum computing, simulation, memory and nonclassical light generation.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary State Preparation via Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on dynamic graphs, referred to as dynamic CTQWs, are a recently introduced universal model of computation that offers a new paradigm in which to envision quantum algorithms. In this work we develop a mapping from dynamic CTQWs to the gate model of computation in the form of an algorithm to convert arbitrary single edge walks and single self loop walks, which are the fundamental building blocks of dynamic CTQWs, to their circuit model counterparts. We use this mapping to introduce an arbitrary quantum state preparation framework based on dynamic CTQWs. Our approach utilizes global information about the target state, relates state preparation to finding the optimal path in a graph, and leads to optimizations in the reduction of controls that are not as obvious in other approaches. Interestingly, classical optimization problems such as the minimal hitting set, minimum spanning tree, and shortest Hamiltonian path problems arise in our framework. We test our methods against uniformly controlled rotations methods, used by Qiskit, and find ours requires fewer CX gates when the target state has a polynomial number of non-zero amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Our study explores multipartite nonlocality by extending $2$-player nonlocal games to multiplayer games, where the players are positioned across the vertices of a graph. We characterize when $2$-player games cannot violate Bell nonlocality on graphs with more than $2$ vertices. Using similar techniques, we show the CHSH game only exhibits nonlocality in two distributed scenarios: the original 2-player game and the 4-player game on the path graph. In contrast, several other well-studied games have no such violations on larger graphs. Lastly, we provide a $2$-player game that exhibits nonlocality on infinitely many graphs.</description>

      <title>How (not) to Build Quantum PKE in Minicrypt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal work by Impagliazzo and Rudich (STOC'89) demonstrated the impossibility of constructing classical public key encryption (PKE) from one-way functions (OWF) in a black-box manner. However, the question remains: can quantum PKE (QPKE) be constructed from quantumly secure OWF? A recent line of work has shown that it is indeed possible to build QPKE from OWF, but with one caveat -- they rely on quantum public keys, which cannot be authenticated and reused. In this work, we re-examine the possibility of perfect complete QPKE in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), where OWF exists. Our first main result: QPKE with classical public keys, secret keys and ciphertext, does not exist in the QROM, if the key generation only makes classical queries. Therefore, a necessary condition for constructing such QPKE from OWF is to have the key generation classically ``un-simulatable''. Previous discussions (Austrin et al. CRYPTO'22) on the impossibility of QPKE from OWF rely on a seemingly strong conjecture. Our work makes a significant step towards a complete and unconditional quantization of Impagliazzo and Rudich's results. Our second main result extends to QPKE with quantum public keys. The second main result: QPKE with quantum public keys, classical secret keys and ciphertext, does not exist in the QROM, if the key generation only makes classical queries and the quantum public key is either pure or ``efficiently clonable''. The result is tight due to all existing QPKEs constructions. Our result further gives evidence on why existing QPKEs lose reusability. To achieve these results, we use a novel argument based on conditional mutual information and quantum Markov chain by Fawzi and Renner (Communications in Mathematical Physics). We believe the techniques used in the work will find other usefulness in separations in quantum cryptography/complexity.</description>

Abstract: We address quantum metrology in critical spin chains with anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, and show how local and quasi-local measurements may be exploited to characterize global properties of the systems. In particular, we evaluate the classical (magnetization) and quantum Fisher information of the relevant parameters for the density matrix of a single spin and that of a pair of spins ranging from nearest to sixth-nearest neighbors, to the limiting case of very distant spins. Our results allow us to elucidate the role of the different parameters and to individuate the optimal working regimes for the precise characterization of the system, also clarifying the effects of correlations on the estimation precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have been essential for simulating statistical physical systems and have proven well applicable to other systems with complex degrees of freedom. Motivated by the statistical physics origins, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en [CKG23] proposed a continuous-time quantum thermodynamic analog to Glauber dynamic that is (i) exactly detailed balanced, (ii) efficiently implementable, and (iii) quasi-local for geometrically local systems. Physically, their construction gives a smooth variant of the Davies' generator derived from weak system-bath interaction. In this work, we give an efficiently implementable discrete-time quantum counterpart to Metropolis sampling that also enjoys the desirable features (i)-(iii). Also, we give an alternative highly coherent quantum generalization of detailed balanced dynamics that resembles another physically derived master equation, and propose a smooth interpolation between this and earlier constructions. We study generic properties of all constructions, including the uniqueness of the fixed-point and the locality of the resulting operators. We hope our results provide a systematic approach to the possible quantum generalizations of classical Glauber and Metropolis dynamics.</description>

      <title>mRNA secondary structure prediction using utility-scale quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have opened new avenues for tackling long-standing complex combinatorial optimization problems that are intractable for classical computers. Predicting secondary structure of mRNA is one such notoriously difficult problem that can benefit from the ever-increasing maturity of quantum computing technology. Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical in designing RNA-based therapeutics as it dictates various steps of an mRNA life cycle, including transcription, translation, and decay. The current generation of quantum computers have reached utility-scale, allowing us to explore relatively large problem sizes. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of solving mRNA secondary structures on a quantum computer with sequence length up to 60 nucleotides representing problems in the qubit range of 10 to 80. We use Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based VQE algorithm to solve the optimization problems, originating from the mRNA structure prediction problem, on the IBM Eagle and Heron quantum processors. To our encouragement, even with ``minimal'' error mitigation and fixed-depth circuits, our hardware runs yield accurate predictions of minimum free energy (MFE) structures that match the results of the classical solver CPLEX. Our results provide sufficient evidence for the viability of solving mRNA structure prediction problems on a quantum computer and motivate continued research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Torsional Regularization of Self-Energy and Bare Mass of Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, the momentum components do not commute; therefore, in quantum field theory, summation over the momentum eigenvalues will replace integration over the momentum. In the Einstein--Cartan theory of gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin, the separation between the eigenvalues increases with the magnitude of the momentum. Consequently, this replacement regularizes divergent integrals in Feynman diagrams with loops by turning them into convergent sums. In this article, we apply torsional regularization to the self-energy of a charged lepton in quantum electrodynamics. We show that this procedure eliminates the ultraviolet divergence. We also show that torsion gives a photon a small nonzero mass, which regularizes the infrared divergence. In the end, we calculate the finite bare masses of the electron, muon, and tau lepton: $0.4329\,\mbox{MeV}$, $90.95\,\mbox{MeV}$, and $1543\,\mbox{MeV}$, respectively. These values constitute about $85\%$ of the observed, re-normalized masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that, in the non-relativistic limit, causal fermion systems give rise to an effective collapse theory. The nonlinear and stochastic correction terms to the Schr\"odinger equation are derived from the causal action principle. The dynamics of the statistical operator is described by a deterministic equation of Kossakowski-Lindblad form. Moreover, the quantum state undergoes a dynamical collapse compatible with Born's rule. The effective model has similarities with the continuous spontaneous localization model, but differs from it by a conservation law for the probability integral as well as a non-locality in time on a microscopic length scale $\ell_{\min}$.</description>

      <title>Ground state phases of the two-dimension electron gas with a unified variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a fundamental model, which is drawing increasing interest because of recent advances in experimental and theoretical studies of 2D materials. Current understanding of the ground state of the 2DEG relies on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, based on variational comparisons of different ansatze for different phases. We use a single variational ansatz, a general backflow-type wave function using a message-passing neural quantum state architecture, for a unified description across the entire density range. The variational optimization consistently leads to lower ground-state energies than previous best results. Transition into a Wigner crystal (WC) phase occurs automatically at rs = 37 +/- 1, a density lower than currently believed. Between the liquid and WC phases, the same ansatz and variational search strongly suggest the existence of intermediate states in a broad range of densities, with enhanced short-range nematic spin correlations.</description>

Abstract: We report on the trapping of single rubidium atoms in large arrays of optical tweezers comprising up to 2088 sites in a cryogenic environment at 6 K. Our approach relies on the use of microscope objectives that are in-vacuum but at room temperature, in combination with windowless thermal shields into which the objectives are protruding to ensure a cryogenic environment for the trapped atoms. To achieve enough optical power for efficient trapping, we combine two lasers at slightly different wavelengths. We discuss the performance and limitations of our design. Finally, we demonstrate atom-by-atom rearrangement of an 828-atom target array using moving optical tweezers controlled by a field-programmable gate array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their versatile chemistry and efficient photoluminescence (PL) properties. While visible emitters are well-established, the pursuit of excellent (near-)infrared sources continues. One notable candidate in this regard are photoluminescent two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibiting excitonic emission at 720 nm (1.7 eV) directly tying to the typical emission range limit of CdSe NPLs. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from this material class. Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and revealing Moire patterns in overlapping structures. At 4K, we observe unique PL features in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no immanent blinking over minutes is observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underpin the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinants are useful to represent the state of an interacting system of (effectively) repulsive and independent elements, like fermions in a quantum system and training samples in a learning problem. A computationally challenging problem is to compute the sum of powers of principal minors of a matrix which is relevant to the study of critical behaviors in quantum fermionic systems and finding a subset of maximally informative training data for a learning algorithm. Specifically, principal minors of positive square matrices can be considered as statistical weights of a random point process on the set of the matrix indices. The probability of each subset of the indices is in general proportional to a positive power of the determinant of the associated sub-matrix. We use Gaussian representation of the determinants for symmetric and positive matrices to estimate the partition function (or free energy) and the entropy of principal minors within the Bethe approximation. The results are expected to be asymptotically exact for diagonally dominant matrices with locally tree-like structures. We consider the Laplacian matrix of random regular graphs of degree $K=2,3,4$ and exactly characterize the structure of the relevant minors in a mean-field model of such matrices. No (finite-temperature) phase transition is observed in this class of diagonally dominant matrices by increasing the positive power of the principal minors, which here plays the role of an inverse temperature.</description>

      <title>Atomistic compositional details and their importance for spin qubits in isotope-purified silicon-germanium quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding crystal characteristics down to the atomistic level increasingly emerges as a crucial insight for creating solid state platforms for qubits with reproducible and homogeneous properties. Here, isotope composition depth profiles in a SiGe/$^{28}$Si/SiGe heterostructure are analyzed with atom probe tomography (APT) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry. Spin-echo dephasing times $T_2^{echo}=128 \mu s$ and valley energy splittings around $200 \mu eV$ have been observed for single spin qubits in this quantum well (QW) heterostructure, pointing towards the suppression of qubit decoherence through hyperfine interaction or via scattering between valley states. The concentration of nuclear spin-carrying $^{29}$Si is 50 ppm in the $^{28}$Si QW. APT allows to uncover that both the top SiGe/$^{28}$Si and the bottom $^{28}$Si/SiGe interfaces of the QW are shaped by epitaxial growth front segregation signatures on a few monolayer scale. A subsequent thermal treatment broadens the top interface by about two monolayers, while the width of the bottom interface remains unchanged. Using a tight-binding model including SiGe alloy disorder, these experimental results suggest that the combination of the slightly thermally broadened top interface and of a minimal Ge concentration of $0.3 \%$ in the QW, resulting from segregation, is instrumental for the observed large valley splitting. Minimal Ge additions $&lt; 1 \%$, which get more likely in thin QWs, will hence support high valley splitting without compromising coherence times. At the same time, taking thermal treatments during device processing as well as the occurrence of crystal growth characteristics into account seems important for the design of reproducible qubit properties.</description>

      <title>Chirp asymmetry in Zeeman electromagnetically induced transparency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplest three-level system exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) exhibits an effective conjugation symmetry as well as a permutation symmetry. Breaking conjugation symmetry leads to a distinct chirp asymmetry; the differential response to a frequency increase versus a frequency decrease. Hanle-Zeeman EIT resonance is an ideal platform for testing the theory of chirp asymmetry because so many optical parameters of the system can be changed experimentally. We describe the theory and compare it to an experiment using 87Rb in a buffer gas cell. In contrast with earlier multi-photon chirp asymmetry work this present effort explores the asymmetry at nearly one billionth the earlier chirp rate, yet displays its universal features. Chirp asymmetry may have metrological consequences for understanding systematic dependence on modulation/demodulation parameters.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Rydberg-dressed extended Bose Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition of different length scales in quantum many-body systems leads to various novel phenomena, including the emergence of correlated dynamics or non-local order. To access and investigate such effects in an itinerant lattice-based quantum simulator, it has been proposed to introduce tunable extended-range interactions using off-resonant optical coupling to Rydberg states. However, experimental realizations of such "Rydberg dressing" have so far mostly concentrated on spin systems without motion. Here, we overcome a number of experimental challenges limiting previous work and realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM). Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively-bound pairs at low filling, and kinetically-constrained "hard rods" at half filling. Near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions. Our results demonstrate the versatility of Rydberg dressing in engineering itinerant optical lattice-based quantum simulators and pave the way to realizing novel light-controlled extended-range interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superpositions of black holes can be described geometrically using a combined canonical formulation for space-time and quantum states. A previously introduced black-hole model that includes quantum fluctuations of metric components is shown here to give full access to the corresponding space-time geometry of weak-field gravity in terms of suitable line elements with quantum corrections. These results can be interpreted as providing covariant formulations of the gravitational force implied by a distribution of black holes in superposition. They can also be understood as a distribution of quantum matter constituents in superposition for a single black hole. A detailed analysis in the weak-field limit reveals quantum corrections to Newton's potential in generic semiclassical states, as well as new bounds on quantum fluctuations, implied by the covariance condition, rather than the usual uncertainty principle. These results provide additional control on quantum effects in Newton's potential that can be used in a broad range of predictions to be compared with observations.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization in Medium from Open Quantum Systems and Chromomagnetic Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Tight Characterizations for Preprocessing against Cryptographic Salting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptography often considers the strongest yet plausible attacks in the real world. Preprocessing (a.k.a. non-uniform attack) plays an important role in both theory and practice: an efficient online attacker can take advantage of advice prepared by a time-consuming preprocessing stage.
  Salting is a heuristic strategy to counter preprocessing attacks by feeding a small amount of randomness to the cryptographic primitive. We present general and tight characterizations of preprocessing against cryptographic salting, with upper bounds matching the advantages of the most intuitive attack. Our result quantitatively strengthens the previous work by Coretti, Dodis, Guo, and Steinberger (EUROCRYPT'18). Our proof exploits a novel connection between the non-uniform security of salted games and direct product theorems for memoryless algorithms.
  For quantum adversaries, we give similar characterizations for property finding games, resolving an open problem of the quantum non-uniform security of salted collision resistant hash by Chung, Guo, Liu, and Qian (FOCS'20). Our proof extends the compressed oracle framework of Zhandry (CRYPTO'19) to prove quantum strong direct product theorems for property finding games in the average-case hardness.</description>

      <title>New Quantum Algorithms for Computing Quantum Entropies and Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a series of quantum algorithms for computing a wide range of quantum entropies and distances, including the von Neumann entropy, quantum R\'{e}nyi entropy, trace distance, and fidelity. The proposed algorithms significantly outperform the prior best (and even quantum) ones in the low-rank case, some of which achieve exponential speedups. In particular, for $N$-dimensional quantum states of rank $r$, our proposed quantum algorithms for computing the von Neumann entropy, trace distance and fidelity within additive error $\varepsilon$ have time complexity of $\tilde O(r/\varepsilon^2)$, $\tilde O(r^5/\varepsilon^6)$ and $\tilde O(r^{6.5}/\varepsilon^{7.5})$, respectively. By contrast, prior quantum algorithms for the von Neumann entropy and trace distance usually have time complexity $\Omega(N)$, and the prior best one for fidelity has time complexity $\tilde O(r^{12.5}/\varepsilon^{13.5})$.
  The key idea of our quantum algorithms is to extend block-encoding from unitary operators in previous work to quantum states (i.e., density operators). It is realized by developing several convenient techniques to manipulate quantum states and extract information from them. The advantage of our techniques over the existing methods is that no restrictions on density operators are required; in sharp contrast, the previous methods usually require a lower bound on the minimal non-zero eigenvalue of density operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical tradeoffs and multi-controlled quantum gate decompositions in variational algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational capabilities of near-term quantum computers are limited by the noisy execution of gate operations and a limited number of physical qubits. Hybrid variational algorithms are well-suited to near-term quantum devices because they allow for a wide range of tradeoffs between the amount of quantum and classical resources used to solve a problem. This paper investigates tradeoffs available at both the algorithmic and hardware levels by studying a specific case -- applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to instances of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. We consider three variants of the QAOA which offer different tradeoffs at the algorithmic level in terms of their required number of classical parameters, quantum gates, and iterations of classical optimization needed. Since MIS is a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the QAOA must respect the problem constraints. This can be accomplished by using many multi-controlled gate operations which must be decomposed into gates executable by the target hardware. We study the tradeoffs available at this hardware level, combining the gate fidelities and decomposition efficiencies of different native gate sets into a single metric called the \textit{gate decomposition cost}.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics for two-level systems with time-dependent driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03342v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation can only be exactly solvable in very rare cases, even for two-level quantum systems. Therefore, finding exact quantum dynamics under time-dependent Hamiltonian is not only of fundamental importance in quantum physics but also can facilitate active quantum manipulations for quantum information processing. Here, we present a method which could generate a near infinite number of analytical-assisted solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a qubit with time-dependent driving. This analytical-assisted solution has free parameters with only boundary restrictions, and thus can find many applications in precise quantum manipulations. Due to the general form of the time-dependent Hamiltonian in our scheme, it can be readily implemented in various experimental setups of qubits. Therefore, our scheme provides new solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger equation, thus provides an alternative and analytical-based routine for precise control over qubits.</description>

      <title>Geometric Visualizations of Single and Entangled Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bloch Sphere visualization of the possible states of a single qubit has proved a useful pedagogical and conceptual tool as a one-to-one map between qubit states and points in a 3-D space. However, understanding many important concepts of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, requires developing intuitions about states with a minimum of two qubits, which map one-to-one to unvisualizable spaces of 6 dimensions and higher. In this paper we circumvent this visualization issue by creating maps of subspaces of 1- and 2-qubit systems that quantitatively and qualitatively encode properties of these states in their geometries. For the 1-qubit case, the subspace approach allows one to visualize how mixed states relate to different choices of measurement in a basis-independent way and how to read off the entries in a density matrix representation of these states from lengths in a simple diagram. For the 2-qubit case, a toroidal map of 2-qubit states illuminates the non-trivial topology of the state space while allowing one to simultaneously read off, in distances and angles, the level of entanglement in the 2-qubit state and the mixed-state properties of its constituent qubits. By encoding states and their evolutions through quantum logic gates with little to no need of mathematical formalism, these maps may prove particularly useful for understanding fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum information at the introductory level. Interactive versions of the visualizations introduced in this paper are available at https://quantum.bard.edu/.</description>

      <title>Estimating Coherent Contributions to the Error Profile Using Cycle Error Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigation and calibration schemes are central to maximize the computational reach of today's Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, but these schemes are often specialized to exclusively address either coherent or decoherent error sources. Quantifying the two types of errors hence constitutes a desirable feature when it comes to benchmarking error suppression tools. In this paper, we present a scalable and cycle-centric methodology for obtaining a detailed estimate of the coherent contribution to the error profile of a hard computing cycle. The protocol that we suggest is based on Cycle Error Reconstruction (CER), also known as K-body Noise Reconstruction (KNR). This protocol is similar to Cycle Benchmarking (CB) in that it provides a cycle-centric diagnostic based on Pauli fidelity estimation [1]. We introduce an additional hyper-parameter in CER by allowing the hard cycles to be folded multiple times before being subject to Pauli twirling. Performing CER for different values of our added hyper-parameter allows estimating the coherent error contributions through a generalization of the fidelity decay formula. We confirm the accuracy of our method through numerical simulations on a quantum simulator, and perform proof-of-concept experiments on three IBM chips, namely ibmq_guadalupe, ibmq_manila, and ibmq_montreal. In all three experiments, we measure substantial coherent errors biased in Z.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having common reference frames or aligned coordinate systems, is one of the presumptions in witnessing entanglement in a two-party state possessed by two remote parties. This assumption may fail for many reasons. With an unlimited supply of singlet states, the two parties can first align their coordinate systems and then measure any entanglement witness. In this article, we propose an alternative method which uses the same resource for incomplete teleportation of states between the two parties, enabeling them to witness the entanglement of any shared state by local measurements without the need of prior alignment of the coordinate systems. The method works for any kind of witness and in any dimension. Beyond the context of Entanglement Witnesses, our method works also for remote measurements of observables of particles (entangled or not) in laboratories which may have deficiency in their resources.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical systems: Quasi-free Markovian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the case of a quantum-classical hybrid system with a finite number of degrees of freedom, the problem of characterizing the most general dynamical semigroup is solved, under the restriction of being quasi-free. This is a generalization of a Gaussian dynamics, and it is defined by the property of sending (hybrid) Weyl operators into Weyl operators in the Heisenberg description. The result is a quantum generalization of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula; Gaussian and jump contributions are included. As a byproduct, the most general quasi-free quantum-dynamical semigroup is obtained; on the classical side the Liouville equation and the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation are included. As a classical subsystem can be observed, in principle, without perturbing it, information can be extracted from the quantum system, even in continuous time; indeed, the whole construction is related to the theory of quantum measurements in continuous time. While the dynamics is formulated to give the hybrid state at a generic time $t$, we show how to extract multi-time probabilities and how to connect them to the quantum notions of positive operator valued measure and instrument. The structure of the generator of the dynamical semigroup is analized, in order to understand how to go on to non quasi-free cases and to understand the possible classical-quantum interactions; in particular, all the interaction terms which allow to extract information from the quantum system necessarily vanish if no dissipation is present in the dynamics of the quantum component. A concrete example is given, showing how a classical component can input noise into a quantum one and how the classical system can extract information on the behaviour of the quantum one.</description>

Abstract: Some quantum information processing protocols necessitate quantum operations that are invariant under complex conjugation. In this study, we analyze the non-local resources necessary for implementing conjugation-symmetric measurements on multipartite quantum networks. We derive conditions under which a given multipartite conjugation can have locally implementable symmetric measurements. In particular, a family of numbers called the ``magic-basis spectrum'' comprehensively characterizes the local measurability of a given 2-qubit conjugation, as well as any other properties that are invariant under local unitary transformations. We also explore the non-local resources required for optimal measurements on known quantum sensor networks by using their conjugation symmetries as a guide.</description>

Abstract: Stabiliser states play a central role in the theory of quantum computation. For example, they are used to encode computational basis states in the most common quantum error correction schemes. Arbitrary quantum states admit many stabiliser decompositions: ways of being expressed as a superposition of stabiliser states. Understanding the structure of stabiliser decompositions has significant applications in verifying and simulating near-term quantum computers.
  We introduce and study the vector space of linear dependencies of $n$-qubit stabiliser states. These spaces have canonical bases containing vectors whose size grows exponentially in $n$. We construct elegant bases of linear dependencies of constant size three.
  Critically, our sparse bases can be computed without first compiling a dictionary of all $n$-qubit stabiliser states. We utilise them to explicitly compute the stabiliser extent of states of more qubits than is feasible with existing techniques. Finally, we delineate future applications to improving theoretical bounds on the stabiliser rank of magic states.</description>

      <title>From the classical Frenet-Serret apparatus to the curvature and torsion of quantum-mechanical evolutions. Part I. Stationary Hamiltonians</title>

Abstract: It is known that the Frenet-Serret apparatus of a space curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space determines the local geometry of curves. In particular, the Frenet-Serret apparatus specifies important geometric invariants, including the curvature and the torsion of a curve. It is also acknowledged in quantum information science that low complexity and high efficiency are essential features to achieve when cleverly manipulating quantum states that encode quantum information about a physical system. In this paper, we propose a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the twisting of quantum curves traced by dynamically evolving state vectors. Specifically, we propose a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a quantum trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced by a parallel-transported pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a stationary Hamiltonian specifying the Schrodinger equation. Our proposed constant curvature coefficient is given by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to the state vector and represents a useful measure of the bending of the quantum curve. Our proposed constant torsion coefficient, instead, is defined in terms of the magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector, orthogonal to both the tangent vector and the state vector. The torsion coefficient provides a convenient measure of the twisting of the quantum curve. Remarkably, we show that our proposed curvature and torsion coefficients coincide with those existing in the literature, although introduced in a completely different manner...</description>

Abstract: We present a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the twisting of quantum curves traced by state vectors evolving under nonstationary Hamiltonians. Specifically, relying on the existing geometric viewpoint for stationary Hamiltonians, we discuss the generalization of our theoretical construct to time-dependent quantum-mechanical scenarios where both time-varying curvature and torsion coefficients play a key role. Specifically, we present a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a quantum trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced out by a parallel-transported pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a time-dependent Hamiltonian specifying the Schrodinger evolution equation. The time-varying curvature coefficient is specified by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to the state vector and measures the bending of the quantum curve. The time-varying torsion coefficient, instead, is given by the magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to the state vector, orthogonal to the tangent vector and state vector and, in addition, measures the twisting of the quantum curve. We find that the time-varying setting exhibits a richer structure from a statistical standpoint. For instance, unlike the time-independent configuration, we find that the notion of generalized variance enters nontrivially in the definition of the torsion of a curve traced out by a quantum state evolving under a nonstationary Hamiltonian. To physically illustrate the significance of our construct, we apply it to an exactly soluble time-dependent two-state Rabi problem specified by a sinusoidal oscillating time-dependent potential...</description>

      <title>Gouy phase and quantum interference with cross-Wigner functions for matter-waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gouy phase is essential for accurately describing various wave phenomena, ranging from classical electromagnetic waves to matter waves and quantum optics. In this work, we employ phase-space methods based on the cross-Wigner transformation to analyze spatial and temporal interference in the evolution of matter waves characterized initially by a correlated Gaussian wave packet. First, we consider the cross-Wigner of the initial function with its free evolution, and second for the evolution through a double-slit arrangement. Different from the wave function which acquires a global Gouy phase, we find that the cross-Wigner acquires a Gouy phase difference due to different evolution times. The results suggest that temporal like-Gouy phases are important for an accurate description of temporal interference. Furthermore, we propose a technique based on the Wigner function to reconstruct the cross-Wigner from the spatial intensity interference term in a double-slit experiment with matter waves.</description>

      <title>Tight concentration inequalities for quantum adversarial setups exploiting permutation symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an $N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-view Feature Extraction (MvFE) has wide applications in machine learning, image processing and other fields. When dealing with massive high-dimensional data, the performance of classical computer faces severe challenges due to MvFE involves expensive matrix calculation. To address this challenge, a quantum-accelerated cross-regression algorithm for MvFE is proposed. The main contributions are as follows:(1) a quantum version algorithm for MvFE is proposed for the first time, filling the gap of quantum computing in the field of MvFE;(2) a quantum algorithm is designed to construct the block-encoding of the target data matrix, so that the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technology based on the block-encoding framework can be used to efficiently realize the quantum simulation of the target data matrix. This approach reduces the dependence of the algorithm's on simulation errors to enhance algorithm performance;(3) compared with the classical counterpart algorithm, the proposed quantum algorithm has a polynomial acceleration in the number of data points, the dimension of data points and the number of view data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative optimal control method of quantum systems, aimed at an implementation of a desired operation with optimal fidelity. The update step of the method is based on the linear response of the fidelity to the control operators, and its projection onto the mode functions of the corresponding operator. Our method extends methods such as gradient ascent pulse engineering and variational quantum algorithms, by determining the fidelity gradient in a hyperparameter-free manner, and using it for a multi-parameter update, capitalizing on the multi-mode overlap of the perturbation and the mode functions. This directly reduces the number of dynamical trajectories that need to be evaluated in order to update a set of parameters. We demonstrate this approach, and compare it to the standard GRAPE algorithm, for the example of a quantum gate on two qubits, demonstrating a clear improvement in convergence and optimal fidelity of the generated protocol.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic Quantum Logic Perspective: Static and Dynamic Revision Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical belief revision framework, as proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson, involves the revision of a theory based on eight postulates. In this paper, we focus on the exploration of a revision theory grounded in quantum mechanics, referred to as the natural revision theory.
  There are two reasoning modes in quantum systems: static intuitionistic reasoning, which incorporates contextuality, and dynamic reasoning, which is achieved through projection measurement. We combine the advantages of two intuitionistic quantum logic frameworks, as proposed by D{\"o}ring and Coecke, respectively. Our goal is to establish a truth-value assignment for intuitionistic quantum logic that not only aligns with the inherent characteristics of quantum mechanics but also supports truth-value reasoning. The natural revision theory is then investigated based on this approach.
  We introduce two types of revision operators that correspond to the two reasoning modes in quantum systems: static and dynamic revision. Furthermore, we highlight the distinctions between these two operators. Shifting away from classical revision paradigms, we consider the revision of consequence relations in intuitionistic quantum logic. We demonstrate how, within the natural revision theory framework, both revision operators collectively influence the consequence relations. Notably, the outcomes of revision process are impacted by the sequence in which these interweaved operators are deployed.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple description of rectangular matrices that can be implemented by a post-selected stabilizer circuit. Given a matrix with entries in dyadic cyclotomic number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\exp(i\frac{2\pi}{2^m}))$, we show that it can be implemented by a post-selected stabilizer circuit if it has entries in $\mathbb{Z}[\exp(i\frac{2\pi}{2^m})]$ when expressed in a certain non-orthogonal basis. This basis is related to Barnes-Wall lattices. Our result is a generalization to a well-known connection between Clifford groups and Barnes-Wall lattices. We also show that minimal vectors of Barnes-Wall lattices are stabilizer states, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we provide a few examples of generalizations beyond standard Clifford groups.</description>

Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1~K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for computational fluid dynamics based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method. Our approach involves a novel encoding strategy and a modified collision operator, assuming full relaxation to the local equilibrium within a single time step. Our quantum algorithm enables the computation of multiple time steps in the linearized case, specifically for solving the advection-diffusion equation, before necessitating a full state measurement. Moreover, our formulation can be extended to compute the non-linear equilibrium distribution function for a single time step prior to measurement, utilizing the measurement as an essential algorithmic step. However, in the non-linear case, a classical postprocessing step is necessary for computing the moments of the distribution function. We validate our algorithm by solving the one dimensional advection-diffusion of a Gaussian hill. Our results demonstrate that our quantum algorithm captures non-linearity.</description>

Abstract: We apply the quantum error detection scheme Pauli check sandwiching (PCS) to quantum networks by turning it into a distributed multiparty protocol. PCS is a distance 1 code and requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection methods. We provide analytical equations for the final fidelity and postselection rate. We also introduce a recursive version of PCS for entanglement purification that only scales polynomially in the resources required as a function of the number of recursions. The recursive PCS scheme generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against BBPSSW in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain substantial fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</description>

      <title>Measurements conspire nonlocally to restructure critical quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically how local measurements perfomed on critical quantum ground states affect long-distance correlations. These states are highly entangled and feature algebraic correlations between local observables. As a consequence, local measurements can have highly nonlocal effects. Our focus is on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) ground states, a continuous family of critical states in one dimension whose structure is parameterized by a Luttinger parameter $K$. We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements, performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a particular measurement outcome we show that there is a transition in the character of the post-measurement quantum state for $K&lt;1$, and highlight a formal analogy with the effect of a static impurity on transport through a TLL. To investigate the full ensemble of measurement outcomes we consider averages of physical quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory under exchange of replicas is broken for $K&lt;1/2$. A well-known barrier to experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has been the need to post-select on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the transition. The phenomena we discuss are, moreover, robust to local decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a massless, minimally coupled scalar field in a $(1+1)$ dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime. In particular, one of the detectors, corresponding to $Alice$, is moving along an outgoing null trajectory. While the other detector carried by $Bob$ is static. With this set-up, we investigate the entangling condition and the measure of the entanglement, concurrence, in the nonextremal and extremal scenarios. Our observations suggest, as expected, a qualitative similarity in characteristics of the entanglement between these two scenarios. However, we find quantitative differences between the nonextremal and extremal concurrences for a broad range of black hole charges. With moderately large detector transition energy, the extremal background always accounts for the larger entanglement than the nonextremal one. In contrast, with low detector transition energy, entanglement on the nonextremal background can be greater. Therefore, by adjusting the detector transition energy, one can perceive optimum entanglement from either the extremal or the nonextremal background.</description>

Abstract: We identify emergent hydrodynamics governing charge transport in Brownian random circuits with various symmetries, constraints, and ranges of interactions. This is accomplished via a mapping between the averaged dynamics and the low energy spectrum of a Lindblad operator, which acts as an effective Hamiltonian in a doubled Hilbert space. By explicitly constructing dispersive excited states of this effective Hamiltonian using a single mode approximation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of diffusive, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive relaxation in many-body systems with conserved multipole moments and variable interaction ranges. Our approach further allows us to identify exotic Krylov-space-resolved hydrodynamics exhibiting diffusive relaxation despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically. Our approach provides a general and versatile framework to qualitatively understand the dynamics of conserved operators under random unitary time evolution.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

Abstract: We generalize L\'evy's lemma, a concentration-of-measure result for the uniform probability distribution on high-dimensional spheres, to a much more general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. For any given density matrix $\rho$ on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, GAP$(\rho)$ is the most spread out probability measure on the unit sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ that has density matrix $\rho$ and thus forms the natural generalization of the uniform distribution. We prove concentration-of-measure whenever the largest eigenvalue $\|\rho\|$ of $\rho$ is small. We use this fact to generalize and improve well-known and important typicality results of quantum statistical mechanics to GAP measures, namely canonical typicality and dynamical typicality. Canonical typicality is the statement that for ``most'' pure states $\psi$ of a given ensemble, the reduced density matrix of a sufficiently small subsystem is very close to a $\psi$-independent matrix. Dynamical typicality is the statement that for any observable and any unitary time-evolution, for ``most'' pure states $\psi$ from a given ensemble the (coarse-grained) Born distribution of that observable in the time-evolved state $\psi_t$ is very close to a $\psi$-independent distribution. So far, canonical typicality and dynamical typicality were known for the uniform distribution on finite-dimensional spheres, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, and for rather special mean-value ensembles. Our result shows that these typicality results hold also for GAP$(\rho)$, provided the density matrix $\rho$ has small eigenvalues. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the canonical ensemble of classical mechanics, our results can also be regarded as a version of equivalence of ensembles.</description>

      <title>Statistics of local level spacings in single- and many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of local level spacings and study their statistics within a random-matrix-theory approach. In the limit of infinite-dimensional random matrices, we determine universal sequences of mean local spacings and of their ratios which uniquely identify the global symmetries of a quantum system and its internal -- chaotic or regular -- dynamics. These findings, which offer a new framework to monitor single- and many-body quantum systems, are corroborated by numerical experiments performed for zeros of the Riemann zeta function, spectra of irrational rectangular billiards and many-body spectra of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Rydberg platform for non-ergodic chiral quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for engineering chiral interactions in Rydberg atoms via a directional antiblockade condition, where an atom can change its state only if an atom to its right (or left) is excited. The scalability of our scheme enables us to explore the many-body dynamics of kinetically constrained models with unidirectional character. We observe non-ergodic behavior via either scars, confinement, or localization, upon simply tuning the strength of two driving fields acting on the atoms. We discuss how our mechanism persists in the presence of classical noise and how the degree of chirality in the interactions can be tuned, opening towards the frontier of directional, strongly correlated, quantum mechanics using neutral atoms arrays.</description>

      <title>SpiDy.jl: open-source Julia package for the study of non-Markovian stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SpiDy.jl solves the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of interacting classical spin vectors and harmonic oscillator networks in contact with a dissipative environment. The methods implemented allow the user to include arbitrary memory effects and colored quantum noise spectra. In this way, SpiDy.jl provides key tools for the simulation of classical and quantum open systems including non-Markovian effects and arbitrarily strong coupling to the environment. Among the wide range of applications, some examples range from atomistic spin dynamics to ultrafast magnetism and the study of anisotropic materials. We provide the user with Julia notebooks to guide them through the various mathematical methods and help them quickly set up complex simulations.</description>

      <title>Unified linear response theory of quantum electronic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the electrical response of multi-level quantum systems at finite frequency has been typically performed in the context of two incomplete paradigms: (i) input-output theory, which is valid at any frequency but neglects dynamic losses, and (ii) semiclassical theory, which captures well dynamic dissipation effects but is only accurate at low frequencies. Here, we develop a unifying theory, valid for arbitrary frequencies, that captures both the quantum behaviour and the non-unitary effects introduced by relaxation and dephasing. The theory allows a multi-level system to be described by a universal small-signal equivalent circuit model, a resonant RLC circuit, whose topology only depends on the number of energy levels. We apply our model to a double quantum-dot charge qubit and a Majorana qubit, showing the capability to continuously describe the systems from adiabatic to resonant and from coherent to incoherent, suggesting new and realistic experiments for improved quantum state readout. Our model will facilitate the design of hybrid quantum-classical circuits and the simulation of qubit control and quantum state readout.</description>

      <title>Single-electron qubits based on quantum ring states on solid neon surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single electrons trapped on solid neon surfaces (eNe) have recently emerged as a promising platform for charge qubits. Experimental results have revealed their exceptionally long coherence times, yet the actual quantum states of these trapped electrons, presumably on imperfectly flat neon surfaces, remain elusive. In this paper, we examine the electron's interactions with neon surface topography, such as bumps and valleys. By evaluating the surface charges induced by the electron, we demonstrate its strong perpendicular binding to the neon surface. The Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the electron's lateral motion on the curved 2D surface is then solved for extensive topographical variations. Our results reveal that surface bumps can naturally bind an electron, forming unique quantum ring states that align with experimental observations. We also show that the electron's excitation energy can be tuned using a modest magnetic field to facilitate qubit operation. This study offers a leap in our understanding of eNe qubit properties and provides strategic insights on minimizing charge noise and scaling the system to propel forward quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we follow the framework given in the article {\it Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pg 58-63 (1989) by R. Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is a circumference of length $\beta$. The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced narrowband spectral filters using rare-earth ions doped in thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip optical filters are fundamental components in optical signal processing. While rare-earth ion-doped crystals offer ultra-narrow optical filtering via spectral hole burning, their applications have primarily been limited to those using bulk crystals, restricting their utility. In this work, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced spectral filtering based on rare-earth ions in an integrated nonlinear optical platform. We incorporate rare-earth ions into high quality-factor ring resonators patterned in thin-film lithium niobate. By spectral hole burning at 4K in a critically coupled resonance mode, we achieve bandpass filters ranging from 7 MHz linewidth, with 13.0 dB of extinction, to 24 MHz linewidth, with 20.4 dB of extinction. By reducing the temperature to 100 mK to eliminate phonon broadening, we achieve an even narrower linewidth of 681 kHz, which is comparable to the narrowest filter linewidth demonstrated in an integrated photonic device, while only requiring a small device footprint. Moreover, the cavity enables reconfigurable filtering by varying the cavity coupling rate. For instance, as opposed to the bandpass filter, we demonstrate a bandstop filter utilizing an under-coupled ring resonator. Such versatile integrated spectral filters with high extinction ratio and narrow linewidth could serve as fundamental components for optical signal processing and optical memories on-a-chip.</description>

      <title>Comparative Microscopic Study of Entropies and their Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>A coherence sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>
