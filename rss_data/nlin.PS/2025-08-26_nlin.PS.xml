      <title>Features of Surface Structuring of Direct and Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors by Femtosecond Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of femtosecond (fs) laser radiation on semiconductors with direct (ZnSe, GaAs, CdZnTe) band gap, with the structurally induced direct-to-indirect band gap transition (PbI2, GaSe) and indirect band gap (Si) has been studied. The fs-laser treatment of semiconductors has been performed in the multi-pulse regime in air environment. The influence of fs-laser radiation parameters on surface morphology of the semiconductors has been analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2D Fourier transform of SEM images, optical photoluminescence spectroscopy. Under the treatment with the fundamental fs-laser radiation (800 nm, about 130-150 fs) both low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS have been observed. Specific features of LIPSS of two types (low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS) and other structure peculiarities (grooves, grains, different defects in periodic structure, i.e. loops, strip breaks, and ablation products) have been also analysed. The formation mechanisms of LIPSS are also considered within the scope of two approaches,namely an electromagnetic approach and matter reorganization processes.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Quasi one dimensional anomalous (rogue) waves in multidimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations 1: fission and fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability (NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and hyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of propagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the behavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order, and described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of NLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of basic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by fission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process of fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are critical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking, and with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$ dimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane, fission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$ axis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D analogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical experiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of "AW growth + fission" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of the modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests their observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Designing reaction-cross-diffusion systems with Turing and wave instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General conditions are established under which reaction-cross-diffusion systems can undergo spatiotemporal pattern-forming instabilities. Recent work has focused on designing systems theoretically and experimentally to exhibit patterns with specific features, but the case of non-diagonal diffusion matrices has yet to be analysed. Here, a framework is presented for the design of general $n$-component reaction-cross-diffusion systems that exhibit Turing and wave instabilities of a given wavelength. For a fixed set of reaction kinetics, it is shown how to choose diffusion matrices that produce each instability; conversely, for a given diffusion tensor, how to choose linearised kinetics. The theory is applied to several examples including a hyperbolic reaction-diffusion system, two different 3-component models, and a spatio-temporal version of the Ross-Macdonald model for the spread of malaria.</description>

      <title>General two-component long-wave short-wave resonance interaction system: Non-degenerate vector solitons and their collision dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the emergence of non-degenerate bright solitons and summarize their several interesting features in a completely integrable two-component long-wave-short-wave resonance interaction model with a general form of nonlinearity coefficients. Through the classical Hirota's bilinear method, we obtain a fully non-degenerate $N$-soliton solution in Gram determinant form for this LSRI model. Depending on the choice of velocity conditions, the obtained non-degenerate fundamental soliton is classified into two types, namely ($1,1,1$)- and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate one solitons. We then show that the basic ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton exhibits novel profile structures, including a double-hump, a special flat-top, and a conventional single-hump profile, and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate soliton admits two-soliton like oblique collision, a behavior akin to KP line soliton interaction with a short stem structure. A detailed asymptotic analysis is carried out to study the long time behavior of ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate solitons and it reveals that they undergo both shape-preserving and shape-changing collisions. However, our analysis confirms that the shape changing collision between these solitons become elastic in nature after appropriate shift of time coordinates. Further, we identified that the ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate solitons also undergo elastic collision. In addition, we have also investigated the formation or suppression of breathing phenomena during collision between a degenerate soliton and a ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton. For completeness, we also point out the collision scenario between the completely degenerate solitons. The results presented in this paper are broadly applicable to Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and other closely related fields.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations - so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable - into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that displays the breaking of 'supersymmetry' causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion and could emerge in other settings, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal breathing solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They can propagate and carry information and energy in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but propagating breathers have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation when a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation is struck; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Importantly, discrete effects tend to stabilize these non-reciprocal breathers over a wider range of initial conditions. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>
