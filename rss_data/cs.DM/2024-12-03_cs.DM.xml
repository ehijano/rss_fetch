      <title>On the Computational Complexity of Multi-Objective Ordinal Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems (MUCO) are in general hard to solve, i.e., the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard and the outcome set is intractable. In this paper we explore special cases of MUCO problems that are actually easy, i.e., solvable in polynomial time. More precisely, we show that MUCO problems with up to two ordinal objective functions plus one real-valued objective function are tractable, and that their complete nondominated set can be computed in polynomial time. For MUCO problems with one ordinal and a second ordinal or real-valued objective function we present an even more efficient algorithm that applies a greedy strategy multiple times.</description>

      <title>Complexity of graph evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A permutation of the elements of a graph is a {\it construction sequence} if no edge is listed before either of its endpoints. The complexity of such a sequence is investigated by finding the delay in placing the edges, an {\it opportunity cost} for the construction sequence. Maximum and minimum cost c-sequences are provided for a variety of graphs and are used to measure the complexity of graph-building programs.</description>

      <title>The Schrijver system of the length polyhedron of an interval order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The length polyhedron of an interval order $P$ is the convex hull of integer vectors representing the interval lengths in possible interval representations of $P$ in which all intervals have integer endpoints. This polyhedron is an integral translation of a polyhedral cone, with its apex corresponding to the canonical interval representation of $P$ (also known as the minimal endpoint representation).
  In earlier work, we introduced an arc-weighted directed graph model, termed the key graph, inspired by this canonical representation. We showed that cycles in the key graph correspond, via Fourier-Motzkin elimination, to inequalities that describe supporting hyperplanes of the length polyhedron. These cycle inequalities derived from the key graph form a complete system of linear inequalities defining the length polyhedron. By applying a theorem due to Cook, we establish here that this system of inequalities is totally dual integral (TDI).
  Leveraging circulations, total dual integrality, and the special structure of the key graph, our main theorem demonstrates that a cycle inequality is a positive linear combination of other cycle inequalities if and only if it is a positive integral linear combination of smaller cycle inequalities (where `smaller' here refers a natural weak ordering among these cycle inequalities). This yields an efficient method to remove redundant cycle inequalities and ultimately construct the unique minimal TDI-system, also known as the Schrijver system, for the length polyhedron. Notably, if the key graph contains a polynomial number of cycles, this gives a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Schrijver system for the length polyhedron.
  Lastly, we provide examples of interval orders where the Schrijver system has an exponential size.</description>

      <title>Compression with wildcards: All induced subgraphs that are (respectively) connected, chordal, bipartite, or forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all connected induced subgraphs of a graph $G=(V,E)$. As a variation we enumerate all "conn-partitions", i.e. partitions $\Pi$ of $V$ with the property that each part of $\Pi$ induces a connected subgraph. In another vein, we enumerate all $X\subseteq V$ which induce a subgraph that is (respectively) chordal, bipartite, or a forest. Mentioned four algorithms, and two more, run in ouput-polynomial time (and deliver their fare in compressed fashion). Along the way we give fresh and short proofs of well-known facts about bipartite graphs and chordless cycles respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LoRa for Edge Computing with TinyML Pipeline for Channel Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to integrate long-distance LongRange (LoRa) communication solution for sending the data from IoT to the edge computing system, by taking advantage of its unlicensed nature and the potential for open source implementations that are common in edge computing. We propose a channel hoping optimization model and apply TinyML-based channel hoping model based for LoRa transmissions, as well as experimentally study a fast predictive algorithm to find free channels between edge and IoT devices. In the open source experimental setup that includes LoRa, TinyML and IoT-edge-cloud continuum, we integrate a novel application workflow and cloud-friendly protocol solutions in a case study of plant recommender application that combines concepts of microfarming and urban computing. In a LoRa-optimized edge computing setup, we engineer the application workflow, and apply collaborative filtering and various machine learning algorithms on application data collected to identify and recommend the planting schedule for a specific microfarm in an urban area. In the LoRa experiments, we measure the occurrence of packet loss, RSSI, and SNR, using a random channel hoping scheme to compare with our proposed TinyML method. The results show that it is feasible to use TinyML in microcontrollers for channel hopping, while proving the effectiveness of TinyML in learning to predict the best channel to select for LoRa transmission, and by improving the RSSI by up to 63 %, SNR by up to 44 % in comparison with a random hopping mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Core Stability Relaxations in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called $\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.</description>

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Topology-Based Reconstruction Prevention for Decentralised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralised learning has recently gained traction as an alternative to federated learning in which both data and coordination are distributed. To preserve the confidentiality of users' data, decentralised learning relies on differential privacy, multi-party computation, or both. However, running multiple privacy-preserving summations in sequence may allow adversaries to perform reconstruction attacks. Current reconstruction countermeasures either cannot trivially be adapted to the distributed setting, or add excessive amounts of noise.
  In this work, we first show that passive honest-but-curious adversaries can infer other users' private data after several privacy-preserving summations. For example, in subgraphs with 18 users, we show that only three passive honest-but-curious adversaries succeed at reconstructing private data 11.0% of the time, requiring an average of 8.8 summations per adversary. The success rate depends only on the adversaries' direct neighbourhood, and is independent of the size of the full network. We consider weak adversaries that do not control the graph topology, cannot exploit the summation's inner workings, and do not have auxiliary knowledge; and show that these adversaries can still infer private data.
  We analyse how reconstruction relates to topology and propose the first topology-based decentralised defence against reconstruction attacks. We show that reconstruction requires a number of adversaries linear in the length of the network's shortest cycle. Consequently, exact attacks over privacy-preserving summations are impossible in acyclic networks.
  Our work is a stepping stone for a formal theory of topology-based decentralised reconstruction defences. Such a theory would generalise our countermeasure beyond summation, define confidentiality in terms of entropy, and describe the interactions with (topology-aware) differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Spectral Antisymmetry of Twisted Graph Adjacency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph with a special character called the canonical character being an extremum. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>
