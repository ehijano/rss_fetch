      <title>Surface chemistry-based continuous separation of polystyrene particles in a microchannel via diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles is of great importance in many fields, such as chemistry, medicine, and chemical engineering. However, separating particles based on their surface physico-chemical properties remains challenging. Diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis have been used for the continuous separation of colloids based on particle size and zeta potential. Here, we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis in electrolyte streams enable the separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. A double junction microfluidic device, fed with low and high electrolyte concentration streams, was used to create steady-state salt concentration gradients. As the streams mix along the channel, the particles are exposed to environments with varying salinity levels, and their dynamics are influenced by the sensitivity of their zeta potential to the local salt concentration. Typically, for carboxylate polystyrene particles, the magnitude of the electrophoretically measured zeta potential decreases with increasing salt concentrations. However, surface conductance effects, which depend on the surface concentration of the carboxyl groups, may lead to an opposite sensitivity of the zeta potential to salt. Therefore, under selected salt conditions, similarly sized polystyrene colloids with comparable zeta potentials in the low concentration stream, but different surface concentrations of carboxyl groups, can be separated in a continuous flow process when they exhibit opposite zeta potential sensitivities to salt. This mechanism has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface physico-chemical properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. Even after tremendous simulation efforts, substantial errors in the free energy profiles remain, which we propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a mixture of electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current theories of diffusiophoresis in porous media are limited to a porous medium saturated with a valence symmetric electrolyte. A predictive model for diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a valence asymmetric electrolyte, or a general mixture of valence symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes, is lacking. To close this knowledge gap, in this work we develop a mathematical model, based upon the regular perturbation method and numerical integration, to compute the diffusiophoretic mobility of a colloid in porous media saturated with a general mixture of electrolytes. We model the electrokinetics using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and the fluid transport in porous media using the Brinkman equation with an electric body force. We report three novel key findings. First, we demonstrate that, in the same electrolyte concentration gradient, lowering the permeability of the porous medium can significantly weaken the colloid diffusiophoretic motion. Second, we show that, surprisingly, by using a valence asymmetric electrolyte the colloid diffusiophoretic motion in a denser porous medium can be stronger than that in a less dense porous medium saturated with a symmetric electrolyte. Third, we demonstrate that varying the composition of an electrolyte mixture does not only change the strength of the colloid diffusiophoretic motion drastically, but also qualitatively its direction. The model developed from this work can be used to understand and predict natural phenomena such as intracellular transport, as well as design technological applications such as enhanced oil recovery, nanoparticle drug delivery, and colloidal species separation.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of hydrophobic-amphiphilic block copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</description>

      <title>A Universal Localized Failure Mechanism for Real Cylindrical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From cell development to space rockets, the mechanical stability of thin shells is crucial across many industrial and natural processes. However, predicting shells' failure properties remains an open challenge, owing to their sensitivity to imperfections inevitably present in real structures. Existing predictive methods are informed by classical stability analyses of idealized shells, which associate shell buckling with a spontaneously emerging delocalized buckling mode. Here, we show through experimental and numerical observations how realistic geometric imperfections instead result in a universal localized buckling mode. The profile of this mode is robust across shells despite their differing underlying defect structures. Further contrasting with classical predictions, a real shell's equilibrium surface deformations grow in the shape of this universal localized mode even at stable loads well before failure. Our findings show that these complex nonlinear dynamics for loads below buckling are described by a 1-D relationship for structures buckling from a saddle-node bifurcation instability. This breakthrough provides a simplified yet general understanding of buckling mechanisms, leading to improved non-destructive predictive methods. To showcase these applications, we experimentally implement a lateral-probing technique that predicts the buckling loads of several unmodified shells to within 1% of the correct value.</description>

      <title>Defect Positioning in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response depends on the frustration (or its absence) due to the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. Specifically, any minimal loop of blocks that may not simultaneously deform in their softest mode defines a mechanical defect at the vertex (in two dimensions) or edge (in three dimensions) that the loop encircles. Defects stiffen the metamaterial, and allow to design the spatial patterns of stress and deformation as the system is externally loaded. We study the ability to place defects at arbitrary positions in metamaterials made of a family of block types that we recently introduced for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Alongside blocks for which we show that any defect configuration is possible, we identify situations in which not all sets are realizable as defects. One of the restrictions is that in three dimensions, defected edges form closed curves. Even in cases when not all geometries of defect lines are possible, we show how to produce defect lines of arbitrary knottedness.</description>

      <title>Physically Constrained 3D Diffusion for Inverse Design of Fiber-reinforced Polymer Composite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored nonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across various industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of FRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop PC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of FRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves for training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually appealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are collision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints during generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous structural transitions in fluids with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. The study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the Rational-Function Approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour of primitive models of molecular ionic liquids in porous media: effects of cation shape, ion association and disordered confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase behaviour of room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) confined in disordered porous media is studied using a theoretical approach that combines an extension of scaled particle theory, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the associative mean spherical approximation. Two models, differing in the shape of the molecular cation, are considered: one with cations formed as charged flexible chains and the other with cations modelled as charged hard spherocylinders. Each model is described by a mixture of dimerized and free ions, while the porous medium is represented as a disordered matrix of hard spheres. We focus on the effects of the molecular cation shape, partial ion association, and disordered confinement on the liquid-vapour-like phase behaviour of the model ILs. In the approximation considered, we find that both the critical temperature and critical density in the model with spherocylinder cations are lower than those in the model with chain cations, and the phase coexistence region is narrower. This is the first theoretical attempt to describe an IL model with molecular ions shaped as spherocylinders, particularly in a disordered porous medium.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization Enables Water Dissociation on Ru(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>

      <title>Self organisation of invasive breast cancer driven by the interplay of active and passive nematic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In invasive breast cancer, cell clusters of varying sizes and shapes are embedded in the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM). Although the prevailing view attributes this structure to increasing disorder resulting from loss of function and dedifferentiation, our findings reveal that it arises through a process of active self-organization driven by cancer cell motility. Simulations and histological analyses of tumours from over 2,000 breast cancer patients reveal that motile, aligned cancer cells within clusters move as active nematic aggregates through the surrounding highly aligned ECM fibres, which form a confining, passive nematic phase. Cellular motion leads to cluster splitting and coalescence. The degree of cluster activity, combined with heterogeneity in cell motility, is reflected in specific scaling behaviours for cluster shape, size distribution, and the distance between cluster boundaries and nematic defects in ECM alignment. Increased activity estimates correlate with tumour progression and are associated with a poorer prognosis for patients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Double Layer-Interlocked Crystals of Nitrogen-Rich Compounds under Zero-Pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01497v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of polyelectrolytes in the presence of varying dielectric discontinuity between solution and substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interactions between polyelectrolytes (PEs) and uncharged substrates at conditions corresponding to a dielectric discontinuity between the aqueous solution and the substrate. To this end, we vary the relevant system characteristics, in particular the substrate dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm s}$ under different salt conditions. We employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with rodlike PEs in salt solutions with explicit ions and implicit water solvent with dielectric constant $\varepsilon_{\rm w} = 80$. As expected, at low salt concentrations, PEs are repelled from the substrates with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} &lt; \varepsilon_{\rm w}$ but are attracted to substrates with a high dielectric constant due to image charges. This attraction considerably weakens for high salt and multivalent counterions due to enhanced screening. Further, for monovalent salt, screening enhances adsorption for weakly charged PEs, but weakens it for strongly charged ones. Multivalent counterions, on the other hand, have little effect on weakly charged PEs, but prevent adsorption of highly charged PEs, even at low salt concentrations. We also find that correlation-induced charge inversion of a PE is enhanced close to the low dielectric constant substrates, but suppressed when the dielectric constant is high. To explore the possibility of a PE monolayer formation, we examine the interaction of a pair of like-charged PEs aligned parallel to a high dielectric constant substrate with $\varepsilon_{\rm s} = 8000$. Our main conclusion is that monolayer formation is possible only for weakly charged PEs at high salt concentrations of both monovalent and multivalent counterions. Finally, we also consider the energetics of a PE approaching the substrate perpendicular to it, in analogy to polymer translocation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of pulsating active liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We demonstrate that such a feedback is compatible with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.</description>

      <title>Surface Furrowing Instability in Everting Soft Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a surface instability observed during the extrusion of extremely soft elastic solids in confined geometries. Due to their unique rheological properties, these soft solids can migrate through narrow gaps by continuously everting the bulk material. The extrusion front spontaneously buckles in the direction transverse to the flow, resulting in a furrow-like morphology that deepens over time. We characterize the distinct features of this instability using experiments and theory and contrast the results with known elastic surface instabilities. Our study may provide insights into various processes involving the extrusion-like deformations of soft solids, including biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in multicomponent liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>
