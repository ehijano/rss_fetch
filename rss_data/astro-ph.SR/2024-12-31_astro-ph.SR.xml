      <title>The magnetic origin of the mystery of rare H$\alpha$ Moreton waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves were detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called the Moreton waves, were rarely captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares in 2010--2023. The H$\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our statistical results show that more than 80\% of the events occur at the edge of active regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Nanoflare Heating During Active Region Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar non-flaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of AR12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by SDO/HMI. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by Chandrayaan-2/XSM. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate- frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.</description>

      <title>Multi-Epoch precise photometry from the ground: MUDEHaR, magnetic stars and everything around</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MUDEHaR is an on-going multi-epoch photometric survey with two narrow filters in H$\alpha$ and the calcium triplet window that uses the T80Cam wide-field imager at the JAST/T80 telescope at Spanish Javalambre astronomical observatory. It is obtaining 100 epochs/year per field for 20 fields in the Galactic disk, each of 2\,deg$^2$, for a total of 40\,deg$^2$. Focused on stellar clusters and HII regions including bright stars, its main objective is to detect tens of thousands OB stars that present emission variability in H$\alpha$ on days-months-years scale. The observed targets include magnetic massive stars, pulsating stars, and all kinds of variable stars. Among our driving scientific objectives of MUDEHaR observations is to identify potential magnetic candidates in massive stars. Only 10--20\,\% of OB stars display a measurable magnetic field, and its origin is still in debate. We outline here the multi-step process involved in identifying OB magnetic stars, highlighting the significance of MUDEHaR observations in this process.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Invited Review) According to modern definition, a symbiotic nova is an otherwise normal nova (i.e. powered by explosive thermonuclear burning) that erupts within a symbiotic star, which is a binary where a WD accretes from a cool giant companion. Guided primarily by the very well observed eruptions of RS Oph in 2006 and 2021, and that of V407 Cyg in 2010, we investigate the main multi-wavelength properties of symbiotic novae and their relation to classical novae, and propose a 3D model structure that identifies the emitting source location for hard and supersoft X-rays, radio syncrothron and thermal, permitted and forbidden emission lines. Very few symbiotic novae are known in the Galaxy, and we compile a revised catalog based on firm astrometric identification. The exciting prospect of an imminent new outburst of T CrB is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Resolving Pleiades binary stars with Gaia and speckle interferometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pleiades is the most prominent open star cluster visible from Earth and an important benchmark for simple stellar populations, unified by common origin, age, and distance. Binary stars are its essential ingredient, yet their contribution remains uncertain due to heavy observational biases. A resolved multiplicity survey was conducted for a magnitude-limited G &lt; 15mag sample of 423 potential cluster members, including sources with poorly fitted astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3. Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter telescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the identification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10 arcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered 21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is confirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia multipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all sources with ipd_frac_multi_peak &gt; 4% are successfully resolved. We found that 10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q &gt; 0.5 within projected separation of 27 &lt; s &lt; 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide binaries with s &gt; 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass ratio (q &gt; 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime at the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q &gt; 0.5 systems is extrapolated to be around 25%.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in Migdal search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the delayed response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>From terrestrial weather to space weather through the history of scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at radio frequencies have proved to be a powerful tool for probing the solar environment from the ground. But how far back does this tradition really extend? Our survey of the literature to date has revealed a long history of scintillating observations, beginning with the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples from around the globe, encompassing the works of the Ancient Greeks and Renaissance scholars, and continuing right through into modern optics, astronomy and space science. We outline here the major steps that humanity has taken along this journey, using scintillation as a tool for predicting first terrestrial, and then space weather without ever having to leave the ground.</description>

      <title>Pattern Finding in mm-Wave Spectra of Massive Young Stellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars play a pivotal role in shaping their galactic surroundings due to their high luminosity and intense ionizing radiation. However, the precise mechanisms governing the formation of massive stars remain elusive. Complex organic molecules (COMs) offer an avenue for studying star formation across the low- to high-mass spectrum because COMs are found in every young stellar object phase and offer insight into the structure and temperature. We aim to unveil evolutionary patterns of COM chemistry in 41 massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) sourced from diverse catalogues, using ALMA Band 6 spectra. Previous line analysis of these sources showed the presence of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$CCH with diverse excitation temperatures and column densities, indicating a possible evolutionary path across sources. However, this analysis usually involves manual line extraction and rotational diagram fitting. Here, we improve upon this process by directly retrieving the physicochemical state of MYSOs from their dimensionally-reduced spectra. We use a Locally Linear Embedding to find a lower-dimensional projection for the physicochemical parameters obtained from individual line analysis. We identify clusters of similar MYSOs in this embedded space using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We find three groups of MYSOs with distinct physicochemical conditions: i) cold, COM-poor sources, ii) warm, medium-COM-abundance sources, and iii) hot, COM-rich sources. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the spectral sample, finding further evidence for an evolutionary path across MYSO groups. Finally, we find that the physicochemical state of our sample can be derived directly from the spectra by training a simple random forest model on the first few PCA components. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in obtaining clear physical insights directly from MYSO spectra.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Solar System Formation Based on Al-Ti Isotope Correlation by Supernova Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radioactive decay of short-lived 26Al to 26Mg has been used to estimate the timescales over which 26Al was produced in a nearby star and the protosolar disk evolved. The chronology commonly assumes that 26Al was uniformly distributed in the protosolar disk; however, this assumption is challenged by the discordance between the timescales defined by the Al-Mg and assumption-free Pb-Pb chronometers. We find that the 26Al heterogeneity is correlated with the nucleosynthetic stable Ti isotope variation, which can be ascribed to the non-uniform distribution of ejecta from a core-collapse supernova in the disk. We use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to calibrate variable 26Al abundances in Al-Mg dating of early solar system processes. The calibrated Al-Mg chronometer indicates a &gt;1 Myr gap between parent body accretion ages of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites. We further use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to constrain the timing and location of the supernova explosion, indicating that the explosion occurred at 20-30 pc from the protosolar cloud, 0.94 +0.25/-0.21 Myr before the formation of the oldest solar system solids. Our results imply that the Sun was born in association with a ~25 solar mass star.</description>

      <title>Two Egyptian Kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, and a solar eclipse (2471 BC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli's arXiv/2412.13640 paper, the eclipse is defined as the 'Shepseskaf eclipse'. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the 'last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf'. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find mentioned by Magli the Akhet Khufu and the symbol of the 'solarized' horizon, it is necessary to stress that Akhet (horizon) is written with the crested ibis, as clearly shown by the Wady el-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. The use of the crested ibis for 'horizon' is attested also in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.</description>

      <title>Solar Filaments Detection using Active Contours Without Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, an active contours without edges (ACWE)-based algorithm has been proposed for the detection of solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar images. The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing. These are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing. Here in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to deform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the boundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the contour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few benchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object detection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of object detection.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter-wave spectroscopy of the CH$_3$O radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f &lt; 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Axion-like Particles from Massive Stars with X-rays and Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot interiors of massive stars in the later stages of their evolution provide an ideal place for the production of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with mass up to O(100 keV) range. We show that a fraction of these ALPs could stream out of the stellar photosphere and subsequently decay into two photons that can be potentially detected on or near the Earth. In particular, we estimate the photon flux originating from the spontaneous decay of heavy ALPs produced inside Horizontal Branch and Wolf-Rayet stars, and assess its detectability by current and future $X$-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. Our results indicate that current and future telescopes can probe axion-photon couplings down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 4\times 10^{-11}$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for $m_a\sim 10-100$ keV, which covers new ground in the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>On Benchmarking SRc $\alpha$ Ori using Period-Luminosity Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14232v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a benchmarking analysis of the semi-regular pulsator and red supergiant $\alpha$ Ori. In its dimming episode last 2020, our observational results include the binned measurements from the space-based telescope SMEI collated. We report a long secondary period of $P_{\text{LSP}}$ = 2350 $\pm$ 10 d and a fundamental radial pulse of $P_0$ = 415 d $\pm$ 30 d along a radial velocity amplitude of the harmonic of $A_{RV}$ = $2.21_{-0.50}^{+0.95}$ km s\textsuperscript{--1} for the interest. Meanwhile, we also detected the first overtone component of $P_1$ = 185 d which all supports the current literature's standing for this newly acquired pulse. At $\sim$2.20 $\pm$ 0.10 $\mu$m, we acquired Near-Infrared $K$-band photometric measurements from several catalogues and surveys in accordance of the calibration. Our assigned inherent color plays at the middle of the extremes from the existing literature. Likewise, we attained a weighted excess color index of $E_{(B-V)}$ = 0.340 and using a $K$-extinction factor of $R_K$ = 0.382 yields an extinction of $A_K$ = 0.130. By subtracting extinction to all $K$-band photometry with usage of both the linearity and newly-derived distance from previous literature, our effort results to a log($L$/$L_{\odot}$) = 5.00 $\pm$ $0.15_{(-0.45)}^{(+0.48)}$ for $\alpha$ Ori. In turn, this allowed us to conduct the benchmarking scheme alongside the data from existing reports that are stitched together using Period-Luminosity ($P$-$L$) Relationship. This results to a best-fit of log($L$/$L_{\odot}$) = 7.26 $\pm$ 0.10 $\times$ log $P$ + ($-14.10$ $\pm$ 0.25) and reveals that $\alpha$ Ori can be situated in the lower bound 18 $M_{\odot}$ regime caused by current pulsation trends.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications. (I) A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate the radiative transfer equation (RTE) efficiently, but current methods are local, limited to constant propagation matrices. The formalism presented in this paper lays the foundations to achieve an efficient non-local integration of the RTE based on the Magnus expansion. Our approach starts formulating the problem in terms of rotations represented in the Lorentz-Poincare group (Stokes formalism) and motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. Then, we combine a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix with Magnus to reformulate the homogenous solution to the RTE. Thus, we obtain a compact analytical evolution operator supporting arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix to first and second order in the Magnus expansion and showing the way to higher orders. Finally, we reformulate the inhomogeneous part to make it solvable with the Magnus expansion too, which gives rise to an interesting new object: the inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent and general formal solution of the RTE that furthermore is non-local, efficient, and accurate by design, with other peculiarity: it separates the integration part from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and with a computational implementation that leads to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and suggests several applications, e.g. accelerating NLTE calculations with non-local radiative transfer. With cosmetic changes, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz-Poincare algebra of the RTE and special relativity.</description>

      <title>An In-depth Investigation of the Primordial Cluster Pair ASCC 19 and ASCC 21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing \texttt{Gaia} data from the literature, we report a new young ($\sim$8.9~Myr) cluster pair, ASCC~19 and ASCC~21, located near the Orion star-forming complex. The clusters are separated by a 3D distance of ~27.00~$\pm$~7.51~pc. Both clusters share a common age (Log(age)~=~6.95~$\pm$~0.05), similar radial velocities ($R_{v}$~=~21.34~$\pm$~4.47~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~19 and $R_{v}$~=~20.05~$\pm$~3.86~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~21), and comparable metallicities ([Fe/H]~=~$-$0.14~$\pm$~0.25~dex for ASCC~19 and [Fe/H]~=~$-$0.12~$\pm$~0.04~dex for ASCC~21, from LAMOST-DR11). These similarities suggest that the clusters likely originated from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud, forming a primordial cluster pair. Furthermore, the formation of the two clusters is attributed to the coalescence of multiple subclusters, as inferred from the distribution analysis between metal abundances and distances to clusters' centers. Neither cluster shows significant mass segregation. Their members with radial velocities exceeding 100~km s$^{-1}$ are young variables. Additionally, a tidal interaction between the clusters is observed. Comparisons of the Roche radius with tidal radii, and velocity difference with orbital velocity, suggest that the pair is an unbound system, that is, a double cluster. Finally, orbital motion simulations show that the clusters will not merge into a single system.</description>

      <title>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>

      <title>Using debris disk observations to infer substellar companions orbiting within or outside a parent planetesimal belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations.
  Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the $K$, $N$, and $Q$ bands and at wavelengths of 70$\mu$m and 1300$\mu$m.
  Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for example between the $N$ and $Q$ band. This can be explained by the varying relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation with JWST/MIRI in the $Q$ band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.</description>

      <title>Star-Disk Collisions: Implications for Quasi-periodic Eruptions and Other Transients Near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star-accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the debris' orbital properties. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass-loss per collision; the mass-loss is much larger after repeated collisions due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass-loss in star-disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ~1000 years; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star-disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (`circularization shocks'). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.</description>

      <title>Spectral dataset of young type Ib supernovae and their time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to high-cadence automated surveys, we can now detect and classify supernovae (SNe) within a few days after explosion, if not earlier. Early-time spectra of young SNe directly probe the outermost layers of the ejecta, providing insights into the extent of stripping in the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism in the case of core-collapse supernovae. However, many SNe show overlapping observational characteristics at early times, complicating the early-time classification. In this paper, we focus on the study and classification of type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib), which are a subclass of core-collapse SNe that lack strong hydrogen lines but show helium lines in their spectra. Here we present a spectral dataset of eight SNe Ib, chosen to have at least three pre-maximum spectra, which we call early spectra. Our dataset was obtained mainly by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and it consists of a total of 82 optical photospheric spectra, including 38 early spectra. This dataset increases the number of published SNe Ib with at least three early spectra by ~60%. For our classification efforts, we used early spectra in addition to spectra taken around maximum light. We also converted our spectra into SN IDentification (SNID) templates and make them available to the community for easier identification of young SNe Ib. Our dataset increases the number of publicly available SNID templates of early spectra of SNe Ib by ~43%. Half of our sample has SN types that change over time or are different from what is listed on the Transient Name Server (TNS). We discuss the implications of our dataset and our findings for current and upcoming SN surveys and their classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Diverse dust populations in the near-Sun environment characterized by PSP/IS$\odot$IS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.</description>
