      <title>Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Indel Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note introduces the harmonic indel distance (HID), a new distance between strings where the cost of an insertion or deletion is inversely proportional to the string length. We present a closed-form formula and show that the HID is a proper distance metric. Then we perform an experimental comparison of HID to normalized and unnormalized versions of the indel distance on benchmark tasks for biomedical sequence data. We finally show planar embeddings of the benchmark datasets to provide some insights into the geometry of the metric spaces associated with the different distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Closed and asymptotic formulae for harmonic and quadratic harmonic sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present here a large collection of harmonic and quadratic harmonic sums, that can be useful in applied questions, e.g., probabilistic ones. We find closed-form formulae, that we were not able to locate in the literature.</description>

      <title>Larger Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set ${\cal A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors of ${\cal A}$ include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists some $\delta = \delta(p)&gt;0$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k/\log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. The size of the set is optimal up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. We further prove two extensions of this result. In the first, we provide a large set ${\cal A}$ of non-self-orthogonal vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ such that for every two subsets of ${\cal A}$ of size $k+1$ each, some vector of one of the subsets is orthogonal to some vector of the other. In the second extension, every $k+1$ vectors of the produced set ${\cal A}$ include $\ell+1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors for an arbitrary fixed integer $1 \leq \ell \leq k$. The proofs involve probabilistic and spectral arguments and the hypergraph container method.</description>
