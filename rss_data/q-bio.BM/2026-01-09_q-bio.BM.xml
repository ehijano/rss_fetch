      <title>Structural-dynamic behavior of histamine in solution: the role of water models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly diluted aqueous solution of histamine was studied by molecular dynamics using the TIP3P and SPC/E water models. It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water'' system under physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>Fold-switching proteins push the boundaries of conformational ensemble prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A protein's function depends critically on its conformational ensemble, a collection of energy weighted structures whose balance depends on temperature and environment. Though recent deep learning (DL) methods have substantially advanced predictions of single protein structures, computationally modeling conformational ensembles remains a challenge. Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability. They reveal that DL models often predict conformational ensembles by association with training-set structures, limiting generalizability. These observations suggest use cases for when DL methods will likely succeed or fail. Developing computational methods that successfully identify new fold-switching proteins from large pools of candidates may advance modeling conformational ensembles more broadly.</description>
