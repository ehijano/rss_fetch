      <title>Viscous current-induced forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion (translational, vibrational, and rotational) of a diatomic impurity immersed in an electron liquid and exposed to electronic current. An approach based on the linear response time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Ehrenfest dynamics leads to a system of linear algebraic equations, which account for the competing and counteracting effects of the current-induced force (electron wind) and the electronic friction. These forces, by means of the dynamic exchange-correlation kernel $f_{xc}({\bf r},{\bf r}',\omega)$, include the electronic viscosity contribution. Starting from the ground state at the equilibrium inter-nuclear distance and applying a current pulse, we observe three phases of the motion: (I) acceleration due to the prevalence of the current-induced force, (II) stabilization upon balancing of the two forces, and (III) deceleration due to the friction after the end of the pulse. The viscous contribution to the force largely increases the acceleration (deceleration) at the first (third) phase of the process. For the aluminium HEG electron density, we find this correction to amount to up to 70% of the total electron wind and friction effects.</description>

      <title>Magnon bands and transverse transport in a proposed two-dimensional $Cu_2F_5$ ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The copper fluoride $Cu_2F_5$ is a proposed stable compound that can be seen as a layered magnetic lattice of $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ sites, corresponding to copper ions. Intending to cast light on the transport properties of ferrimagnetic magnons, we use the linear spin wave approach to study the magnon band structure of the 2D lattice in a ferrimagnetic off-plane order, as well as the transverse transport of magnons in the crystal bulk. That transverse (Hall-like) transport can be induced by a magnetic field or temperature gradient, and within the linear response theory is generated by the Berry curvature of the eigenstates. As in most of the cases for magnons, the Berry curvature here is related to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next-near-neighbors. The band structure of the system is non-degenerate and the transport coefficients are non-null. We also determine the condition for two transport coefficients to change sign in response to temperature.</description>

      <title>Towards adiabatic-connection interpolation model with broader applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adiabatic Connection Integrand Interpolation (ACII) method represents a general path for calculating correlation energies in electronic systems within the Den sity Functional Theory. ACII functionals include both exact-exchange and the second-order correlation energy, as well as an interpolating function toward the strictly-correlated electron (SCE) regime. Several interpolating functions have been proposed in the last years targeting different properties, yet an accurate ACII approach with broad applicability is sti ll missing. Recently, we have proposed an ACII functional that was made accurate for the three-dimensional (3D) uniform electron gas as well as for model metal clusters. In this work we present an ACII functional (named genISI2) which is very accurate for both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) uniform electron gases and for the q uasi-2D infinite barrier model, where most of the exchange-correlation functionals fail badly, as well as for strongly correlated two-electrons systems. Using the exact-exchange Kohn-Sham orbitals, we have also assessed the genISI2 for various molecular systems, showing a superior performance with respect to the o ther ACII methods for total energies, atomization energies, and ionization potentials. The genISI2 functional can thus find application in a broad range of systems and properties.</description>

      <title>Crystal design of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in condensed matter. The unique entanglement between magnetic sublattices and alternating crystal environment in altermagnets provides a unique opportunity for designing magnetic space symmetry. There have been extensive experimental efforts concentrated on tuning the Neel vector to reconstruct altermagnetic symmetry. However, it remains challenging to modulate the altermagnetic symmetry through the crystal aspect. Here, the crystal design of altermagnetism is successfully realized, by breaking glide mirrors and magnetic mirrors of the (0001) crystallographic plane in CrSb films via crystal distortion. We establish a locking relationship between altermagnetic symmetry and the emergent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) vectors in different CrSb films, realizing unprecedentedly room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnetic metal. The concept of exchange-coupling torques is broadened to include both antiferromagnetic exchange-coupling torque and DM torque. Their relationship is designable, determining electrical manipulation modes, e.g., field-assisted switching for CrSb(1-100)/Pt and field-free switching for W/CrSb(11-20). Particularly, the unprecedentedly field-free 100-percent switching of Neel vectors is realized by making these two torques parallel or antiparallel, dependent on Neel vector orientation. Besides unravelling the rich mechanisms for electrical manipulation of altermagnetism rooted in broadened concept of exchange-coupling torques, we list other material candidates and propose that crystal design of altermagnetism would bring rich designability to magnonics, topology, etc.</description>

      <title>Grain growth competition and formation of grain boundaries during solidification of hcp alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth competition during directional solidification of a polycrystal with hexagonal (hcp) symmetry (Mg-1wt%Gd alloy) is studied by phase-field modeling, exploring the effect of the temperature gradient G on the resulting grain boundary (GB) orientation selection. Results show that selection mechanisms and scaling laws derived for cubic (fcc, bcc) crystals also apply to hcp materials (within their basal plane), provided a re-estimation of fitting parameters and re-scaling to account for the sixfold symmetry. While grain growth competition remains stochastic with rare events of unexpected elimination or side-branching along the developing GBs, we also confirm an overall transition from a geometrical limit to a favorably oriented grain limit behavior with an increase of thermal gradient within the dendritic regime, and the progressive alignment of dendrites and GBs toward the temperature gradient direction with an increase of G during the dendritic-to-cellular morphological transition. Comparisons with original thin-sample directional solidification experiments show a qualitative agreement with PF results, yet with notable discrepancies, which nonetheless can be explained based on the stochastic variability of selected GB orientations, and the statistically limited experimental sample size. Overall, our results extend the understanding of GB formation and grain growth competition during solidification of hcp materials, and the effect of thermal conditions, nonetheless concluding on the challenges of extending the current studies to three dimensions, and the need for much broader (statistically significant) data sets of GB orientation selected under well-identified solidification conditions.</description>

      <title>A compact approach to higher-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering detection using photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of inelastically scattered soft X-rays with high energy resolution usually requires large grating spectrometers. Recently, photoelectron spectrometry for analysis of X-rays (PAX) has been rediscovered for modern spectroscopy experiments at synchrotron light sources. By converting scattered photons to electrons and using an electron energy analyser, the energy resolution for resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) becomes decoupled from the X-ray spot size and instrument length. In this work, we develop PAX towards high energy resolution using a modern photoemission spectroscopy setup studying Ba2Cu3O4Cl2 at the Cu L3-edge. We measure a momentum transfer range of 24% of the first Brillouin zone simultaneously. Our results hint at the observation of a magnon excitation below 100 meV energy transfer and show intensity variations related to the dispersion of dd-excitations. With dedicated setups, PAX can become an alternative to the best and largest RIXS instruments, while at the same time opening new opportunities to acquire RIXS at a range of momentum transfers simultaneously and combine it with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a single instrument.</description>

      <title>Physics-Transfer Learning for Material Strength Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of materials, like many problems in the natural sciences, spans multiple length and time scales, and the solution has to balance accuracy and performance. Peierls stress is one of the central concepts in crystal plasticity that measures the strength through the resistance of a dislocation to plastic flow. The determination of Peierls stress involves a multiscale nature depending on both elastic lattice responses and the energy landscape of crystal slips. Material screening by strength via the Peierls stress from first-principles calculations is computationally intractable for the nonlocal characteristics of dislocations, and not included in the state-of-the-art computational material databases. In this work, we propose a physics-transfer framework to learn the physics of crystal plasticity from empirical atomistic simulations and then predict the Peierls stress from chemically accurate density functional theory-based calculations of material parameters. Notably, the strengths of single-crystalline metals can be predicted from a few single-point calculations for the deformed lattice and on the {\gamma} surface, allowing efficient, high-throughput screening for material discovery. Uncertainty quantification is carried out to assess the accuracy of models and sources of errors, showing reduced physical and system uncertainties in the predictions by elevating the fidelity of training models. This physics-transfer framework can be generalized to other problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma, by harnessing the hierarchy of physics in the multiscale models of materials science.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and thermodynamic optimization of phase diagram of lithium niobate tantalate solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of the lithium niobate and lithium tantalate solid solutions was investigated using experimental data from differential thermal analysis (DTA) and crystal growth. We used XRF analysis to determine the elemental composition of crystals. Based on the Neumann-Kopp rule, essential data of end members lithium niobate (LN) and lithium tantalate (LT) was created. The heats of fusion of end members given by DTA measurements of LN (103 kJ/mol at 1531 K) and LT (289 kJ/mol at 1913 K) were given as input parameters to generate the data. This data served as the basis for calculating a phase diagram for LN and LT solid solutions. Finally, based on the experimental data and thermodynamic solution model, the phase diagram was optimized in the Calphad Factsage module. We also generated thermodynamic parameters for Gibb's excess energy of the solid solution. A plot of segregation coefficient as a function of Ta concentration was derived from the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Electronic and dynamical properties of cobalt monogermanide CoGe phases under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the pressure dependence of the electronic and dynamical properties of six different CoGe phases: orthorhombic Cmmm, hexagonal P6/mmm and P$\bar{6}$2m, monoclinic C2/m, cubic P2$_{1}$3, and orthorhombic Pnma. Using first-principles DFT calculations and the direct force-constants method, we study the dynamical stability of individual phases under external pressure. We show that the orthorombic Cmmm and hexagonal P6/mmm structures are unstable over a broad pressure range and most pronounced imaginary phonon soft mode in both cases leads to a stable hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m structure of the lowest ground-state energy of all studied phases at ambient and low (below $\sim 3$ GPa) external pressure. Under these conditions, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase has the highest energy, however, together with monoclinic C2/m and orthorombic Pnma it is dynamically stable and all these three structures can potentially coexist as meta-stable phases. Above $\sim 3$ GPa, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase becomes the most energetically favorable. Fitting the Birch--Murnaghan equation of state we derive bulk modulus for all mentioned phases, which indicate relatively high resistance of CoGe to compression. Such conclusions are confirmed by band structure calculations. Additionally, we show that electronic bands of the hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m phase reveal characteristic features of the kagome-like structure, while in the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase spectrum, one can locate spin-1 and double Weyl fermions. In both cases, the external pressure induces the Lifshitz transition, related to the modification of the Fermi surface topology.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Theory of Elastic Semiconductors with Consideration of Mobile Charge Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of nonlinear equations for the macroscopic theory of elastic semiconductors is derived which generalizes the seminal work of Tiersten by including the inertia of the mobile charge carriers. The equations obtained can describe carrier plasma waves and their interactions with elastic waves. Another generalization in this paper is that the internal energy densities of the mobile charges are allowed to depend on temperature in addition to charge densities. The equations are in SI units.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetic ruthenium oxide RuO$_{2}$ crystallizes with P4$_{2}$/mnm symmetry. Here we discuss the lattice dynamics of this structure. We show and discuss the phonon dispersion and density of states. The phonon dispersion curves contain several Dirac nodal lines and highly degenerate Dirac points. We present the characteristic frequencies and their irreducible representations at the $\Gamma$ point. Theoretically obtained frequencies of the Raman active modes nicely reproduce the ones reported experimentally.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Magnetic Topological Semimetal Eu3In2As4 with a Single Pair of Weyl Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetal (MWS) is a unique topological state with open surface Fermi arc states and other exotic transport phenomena. However, most reported MWSs show multiple pairs of Weyl points and complicated Fermi surfaces, which increases the difficulty of the investigation into the intrinsic chiral transport property. In this wor, we successfully synthesized a soft magnetic Weyl semimetal Eu3In2As4 with a single pair of Weyl points under magnetic fields. The Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillation with a single frequency, as well as a linear hall resistance with the same carrier density, is observed up to 50 Tesla, indicating a single pair of Weyl points around the Fermi level with a massless fermion (m* = 0.121 m0, Berry phase). Such a single pair of Weyl points is further confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. The magnetic ordering and band topology can be easily tuned by the external magnetic field. The field-induced MWS Eu3In2As4 with a single pair of Weyl points is a good platform to detect chiral transport properties, including possible quantum anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Phonon pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>

      <title>A first principles study of the Stark shift effect on the zero-phonon line of the NV center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are attractive candidates for quantum information science applications owing to their ability to act as spin-photon interface or single-photon emitters. However, the coupling between the change of dipole moment upon electronic excitation and stray electric fields in the vicinity of the defect, an effect known as Stark shift, can cause significant spectral diffusion in the emitted photons. In this work, using first principles computations, we revisit the methodology to compute the Stark shift of point defects up to the second order. The approach consists of applying an electric field on a defect in a slab and monitoring the changes in the computed zero-phonon line (i.e., difference in energy between the ground and excited state) obtained from constraining the orbital occupations (constrained-DFT). We study the Stark shift of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond using this slab approach. We discuss and compare two approaches to ensure a negatively charged defect in a slab and we show that converged values of the Stark shift measured by the change in dipole moment between the ground and excited states ($\Delta \mu$) can be obtained. We obtain a Stark shift of $\Delta \mu$=2.68D using the semi-local GGA-PBE functional and of $\Delta \mu$=2.23D using the HSE hybrid-functional. The results of the slab computations are significantly different than those obtained with Modern Theory of Polarization ($\Delta \mu$=4.34D for GGA-PBE) indicating a potential issue with the combination of constrained-DFT and Modern Theory of Polarization, at least in certain codes.</description>

      <title>Superexchange Mechanism in Coupled Triangulenes Forming Spin-1 Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the origin of the antiferromagnetic coupling in spin-1 triangulene chains, which were recently synthesized and measured by Mishra et al. Nature 598, 287-292 (2021) originates from a superexchange mechanism. This process, mediated by inter-triangulene states, opens the possibility to control parameters in the effective bilinear-biquadratic spin model. We start from the derivation of an effective tight-binding model for triangulene chains using a combination of tight-binding and Hartree-Fock methods fitted to hybrid density functional theory results. Next, correlation effects are investigated within the configuration interaction method. Our low-energy many-body spectrum for $N_{\rm Tr}=2$ and $N_{\rm Tr}=4$ triangulene chains agree well with the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain antiferromagnetic model when indirect coupling processes, and superexchange coupling between triangulene spins are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces a detailed computational framework designed to analyze and forecast the complex multiphase characteristics of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are essential for developing sustainable technological advancements. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have a significant thermo-electromechanical response, although their electromechanical characteristics vary throughout different phases of the material. Lead-free piezoelectric materials undergo phase changes, including rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases, when the temperature changes. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, multiple phases exist simultaneously under certain temperature, electrical, and mechanical conditions, resulting in the material displaying intricate multiphase behavior. Studying such behaviour is crucial for evaluating the performance of these materials. The computational approach in this research relies on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to model micro-domain phase changes in the material. This research will enhance our comprehension of the significance of complex multiphase behaviour in creating environment-friendly and sustainable technological solutions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the nature of quasi van der Waals Epitaxy of magnetic topological insulators Cr: (BixSb1-x)2Te3 on a GaAs (111) substrate through coherently strained interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi van der Waals Epitaxy (qvdWE) has been realized for decades at the interfaces between 3D and 2D materials or van der Waals materials. The growth of magnetic topological insulators (MTI) Cr: (BixSb1-x)2Te3 (CBST) on GaAs (111) substrates for Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAH) is actually one of the examples of qvdWE, which is not well noticed despite the fact that its advantages have been used in growth of various MTI materials. This is distinguished from the growth of MTIs on other substrates. Although the qvdWE mode has been used in many 2D growth on III-V substrates, the specific features and mechanisms are not well demonstrated and summarized yet. Here in this work, we have for the first time shown the features of both coherent interfaces and the existence of strain originating from qvdWE at the same time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a high current interest for novel plasmonic platforms and materials able to extend their applicability into the ultraviolet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the UV it is possible to explore spectral properties of biomolecules with small cross section in the visible spectral range. However, most used metals in plasmonics have their resonances at wavelengths &gt; 350 nm. Aluminum and rhodium are two interesting candidate materials for UV plasmonics, and in this work we developed a simple and low-cost preparation of functional substrates based on nanoporous aluminum decorated with rhodium nanoparticles. We demonstrate that these functionalized nanoporous metal films can be exploited as plasmonic materials suitable for enhanced UV Raman spectroscopy</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved random telegraph fluctuations of a single trap at the Si/SiO2 interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use electrostatic force microscopy to spatially resolve random telegraph noise at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Our measurements demonstrate that two-state fluctuations are localized at interfacial traps, with bias-dependent rates and amplitudes. These two-level systems lead to correlated carrier number and mobility fluctuations with a range of characteristic timescales; taken together as an ensemble, they give rise to a $1/f$ power spectral trend. Such individual defect fluctuations at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface impair the performance and reliability of nanoscale semiconductor devices, and will be a significant source of noise in semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers. The fluctuations measured here are associated with a four-fold competition of rates, including slow two-state switching on the order of seconds and, in one state, fast switching on the order of nanoseconds which is associated with energy loss.</description>

      <title>Metastable ordered states induced by low temperature annealing of {\delta}-Ag2/3V2O5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In {\delta}-Ag2/3V2O5 with charge degrees of freedom in V, it is known that the charge ordering state and physical properties of V that appear at low temperatures depend strongly on the ordering state of Ag. In this study, we focused on the Ag ions in the interlayer and studied the structure using synchrotron radiation powder diffraction in dependence on temperature. We found that when the sample is slowly cooled from room temperature and ordering occurs at the Ag sites, V4+/V5+ charge ordering of V and subsequent V4+-V4+ structural dimers are produced. Although quenching the sample from room temperature suppresses the ordering of Ag, annealing at around 160 K promotes partial ordering of Ag and allows a metastable phase to be realized. This metastable phase is maintained even when the temperature is lowered again, producing a remarkable change in low-temperature properties. These results indicate that the ordered state of Ag, which is the key to control the charge-ordered state and physical properties, can be controlled by low-temperature annealing. The results of this study may provide a methodology for the realization of metastable states in a wide range of material groups of vanadium compounds, where competition among various charge ordered states underlies the physical properties.</description>

      <title>Distance-Dependent Evolution of Electronic States in Kagome- Honeycomb Lateral Heterostructures in FeSn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the formation and electronic influence of lateral heterointerfaces in FeSn containing Kagome and honeycomb layers. Lateral heterostructures offer spatially resolved property control, enabling the integration of dissimilar materials and promoting phenomena not typically observed in vertical heterostructures. Using the molecular beam epitaxy technique, we achieve a controllable synthesis of lateral heterostructures in the Kagome metal FeSn. With scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in conjunction with first-principles calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the bonding motif connecting the Fe3Sn-terminated Kagome and Sn2-terminated honeycomb surfaces. More importantly, we reveal a distance-dependent evolution of the electronic states in the vicinity of the heterointerfaces. This evolution is significantly influenced by the orbital character of the flat bands. Our findings suggest an approach to modulate the electronic properties of the Kagome lattice, which should be beneficial for the development of future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Superconducting Infinite-Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revealing the momentum-resolved electronic structure of infinite-layer nickelates is essential for understanding this new class of unconventional superconductors, but has been hindered by the formidable challenges in improving the sample quality. In this work, we report for the first time the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and ${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ atomic-hydrogen reduction. The measured Fermi topology closely matches theoretical calculations, showing a large Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived Fermi sheet that evolves from hole-like to electron-like along $k_{z}$, and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket centered at Brillouin zone corner. The Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands show a mass enhancement ($m^*/m_{\rm{DFT}}$) of 2-3,while the 3D electron band shows negligible band renormalization. Moreover, the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived states also display a band dispersion anomaly at higher binding energy, reminiscent of the waterfall feature and kinks observed in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present research, we demonstrate the usage of plasmonic effects in thin film structures to control magnetic topological textures, specifically skyrmions and skyrmioniums. We investigate numerically the generation and alteration of these topological structures caused by hemisphere gold nanoparticle placed over a magnetic layer coated with a dielectric material. The electromagnetic and photothermal models are used to clarify the processes of producing heat and absorption, and the results were implemented in micromagnetic formalism to reveal the dynamics of magnetization under various conditions. Our findings demonstrate the significance of the laser pulse duration and the contact area between nanoparticles and the underlying magnetic layer in forming topological textures. In particular, we show how to generate a single skyrmion, multiple skyrmions, and skyrmioniums, and how to dynamically transition between these states. These results highlight the possibility of manipulating magnetic textures by using plasmonic effects, which presents significant opportunities for spintronics and non-conventional computer applications.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with 3D dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the infinite-layer (IL) nickelates provides a new platform and angle of view to study the long-standing problem of high temperature superconductivity . Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here, we fill this gap by preparing IL LaNiO$_2$ and La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films with superior surface quality and measuring their electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).The Fermi surface consists of a large three-dimensional hole pocket primarily contributed by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and a small electron pocket at the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner. The hole pocket exhibits a two-dimensional character over approximately 80% of the Brillouin zone, and its Fermi surface topology and band dispersion closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates, suggesting their superconducting mechanisms may be alike. Yet this hole pocket shows strong three-dimensional character near $k_z=\pi$, which deviates from previous calculations and adds new facets to the superconductivity in IL nickelates. The experimental electronic structure represents a pivotal step toward a microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb and Cs) have attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders. Among them, the charge density wave (CDW) order has been shown to host various unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the CDW order by a combination of both bulk and surface doping methods. While element substitutions in bulk doping change both carriers and the crystal lattice, the surface doping primarily tunes the carrier concentration. As such, our results reveal a two-dimensional phase diagram of the CDW in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. In the lightly bulk doped regime, the existence of CDW order is reversible by tuning the carrier concentration. But excessive bulk doping permanently destroys the CDW, regardless of the carrier doping level. These results provide insights to the origin of the CDW from both electronic and structural degrees of freedom. They also open an avenue for manipulating the exotic CDW order in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and WI$_3$ have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in both materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and compositional phase stability in refractory high-entropy alloys via first principles theory and atomistic modelling: NbMoTa, NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an all-electron, first principles, Landau-type theory, we study the nature of short-range order and compositional phase stability in equiatomic refractory high entropy alloys, NbMoTa, NbMoTaW, and VNbMoTaW. We also investigate selected binary subsystems to provide insight into the physical mechanisms driving order. Our approach examines the short-range order of the solid solutions directly, infers disorder/order transitions, and also extracts parameters suitable for atomistic modelling of diffusional phase transformations. We find a hierarchy of relationships between the chemical species in these materials which promote ordering tendencies. The most dominant is a relative atomic size difference between the 3d element, V, and the other 4d and 5d elements which drives a B32-like order. For systems where V is not present, ordering is dominated by the difference in filling of valence states; pairs of elements which are isoelectronic remain weakly correlated to low temperatures, while pairs with a valence difference present B2-like order. Our estimated order-disorder transition temperature in VNbMoTaW is sufficiently high for us to suggest that SRO in this material may be experimentally observable.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for advanced logic transistor technologies are deposited by various modifications of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using a wide variety of precursors. Being a major electrical performance limiter, the TMD crystal grain size strongly differs between the various CVD precursor chemistries from nano- to millimeter-sized crystals. However, it remains unclear how the CVD precursor chemistry affects the nucleation density and resulting TMD crystal grain size. This work postulates guiding principles to design a CVD process for highly crystalline TMD deposition using a quantitative analytical model benchmarked against literature. The TMD nucleation density reduces favorably under low supersaturation conditions, where the metal precursor sorption on the starting surface is reversible and the corresponding metal precursor desorption rate exceeds the overall deposition rate. Such reversible precursor adsorption guarantees efficient long-range gas-phase lateral diffusion of precursor species in addition to short-range surface diffusion, which vitally increases crystal grain size. As such, the proposed model explains the large spread in experimentally observed TMD nucleation densities and crystal grain sizes for state-of-the-art CVD chemistries. Ultimately, it empowers the reader to interpret and modulate precursor adsorption and diffusion reactions through designing CVD precursor chemistries compatible with temperature sensitive application schemes.</description>

      <title>Ideas of lattice-basis reduction theory for error-stable Bravais lattice determination and ab-initio indexing</title>

Abstract: Although newly developed indexing software is frequently reported in crystallography, it is not widely recognized that the use of error-stable Bravais lattice determinations can simplify indexing algorithms and increase their success rates. In indexing, a code for error-stable unit-cell identification is also required to exclude duplicate solutions. One of our goals is to collect information on the lattice-basis reduction theory and its application to these analyses.
  The main result is an error-stable Bravais lattice determination algorithm for 2D lattices, along with a mathematical proof that it works even for parameters containing large observational errors. As in our algorithm for 3D lattices, it uses two lattice-basis reduction methods that seem to be optimal for different symmetries.
  As another application of lattice-basis reduction theory to the unit-cell identification, we introduce several methods to measure the difference of unit cells known in crystallography and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Frustrated metastable-to-equilibrium grain boundary structural transition in NbMoTaW due to segregation and chemical complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundary structural transitions can lead to significant changes in the properties and performance of materials. In multi-principal element alloys, understanding these transitions becomes complex due to phenomena such as local chemical ordering and multi-component segregation. Using atomistic simulations, we explore a metastable-to-equilibrium grain boundary structural transition in NbMoTaW. The transition, characterized by structural disordering and reduced free volume, shows high sensitivity to its local chemical environment. Most notably, the transition temperature range of the alloy is more than twice that of a pure metal. Differences in composition between coexisting metastable and equilibrium structures highlight the change in local site availability due to structural relaxation. Further examination of grain boundaries with fixed chemical states at varying temperatures reveals that the amount of segregation significantly influences the onset temperature yet has minimal effect on the transition width. These insights underscore the profound effects of chemical complexity and ordering on grain boundary transitions in complex concentrated alloys, marking a meaningful advancement in our understanding of grain boundary behavior at the atomic level.</description>

      <title>A self-assembled periodic nanoporous framework in aqueous solutions of the DNA tetramer GCCG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective behavior of the shortest DNA oligomers in high concentration aqueous solutions is an unexplored frontier of DNA science and technology. Here we broaden the realm of DNA nanoscience by demonstrating that single-component aqueous solutions of the DNA 4-base oligomer GCCG can spontaneously organize into three-dimensional (3D) periodic mesoscale frameworks. This oligomer can form B-type double helices by Watson-Crick (WC) pairing, into tiled brickwork-like duplex strands, which arrange into mutually parallel arrays and form the nematic and columnar liquid crystal phases, as is typical for long WC chains. However, at DNA concentrations above 400mg/mL, these solutions nucleate and grow an additional mesoscale framework phase, comprising a periodic network on a three dimensional body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. This lattice is an array of nodes (valence-8, each formed by a pair of quadruplexes of GCCG terminal Gs), connected with a separation of 6.6 nm by struts (6-GCCG-long WC duplexes). This 3D-ordered DNA framework is of low density (DNA volume fraction ~0.2), but, due to its 3D crystal structure, is osmotically incompressible over its phase range. Atomistic simulations confirm the stability of such structures, which promise to form the basis of novel families of simply and inexpensively made nanoscale frameworks for templating and selection applications.</description>

      <title>Energy function for grain boundary plane orientation fundamental zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of grain boundary (GB) plane orientation fundamental zone (FZ) has connected GB structures across multiple crystallographic characters with their properties in a unique insight, but quantitative understandings of the structure-property relationship therein are still lacking. Based on the well-known Read-Shockley relationship, a theoretical derivation is proposed to predict low angle GB energies as a function of FZ parameters, which forms a standard energy function that accurately captures the simulated energy trends in a simple and clear manner. The theorization presented here is therefore expected to be a starting point for modern GB energy functions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of sliding ferroelectricity and dynamical magnetic field in van der Waals bilayer induced by light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is a unique type of polarity recently observed in a properly stacked van der Waals bilayer. However, electric-field control of sliding ferroelectricity is hard and could induce large coercive electric fields and serious leakage currents which corrode the ferroelectricity and electronic properties, which are essential for modern two-dimensional electronics and optoelectronics. Here, we proposed laser-pulse deterministic control of sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer h-BN by first principles and molecular dynamics simulation with machine-learned force fields. The laser pulses excite shear modes which exhibit certain directional movements of lateral sliding between bilayers. The vibration of excited modes under laser pulses is predicted to overcome the energy barrier and achieve the switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Furthermore, it is found that three possible sliding transitions - between AB (BA) and BA (AB) stacking - can lead to the occurrence of dynamical magnetic fields along three different directions. Remarkably, the magnetic fields are generated by the simple linear motion of nonmagnetic species, without any need for more exotic (circular, spiral) pathways. Such predictions of deterministic control of sliding ferroelectricity and multi-states of dynamical magnetic field thus expand the potential applications of sliding ferroelectricity in memory and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity by Engineering Noncollinear Magnetism in Magnet/ Superconductor Heterostructures: A Realistic Prescription for 2D Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a realistic and rather general scheme where noncollinear magnetic textures proximitized with the most common $s$-wave superconductor can appear as the alternative to $p$-wave superconductor{--}the prime proposal to realize two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev model for topological superconductors (TSCs) hosting Majorana flat edge mode (MFEM). A general minimal Hamiltonian suitable for magnet/superconductor heterostructures reveals robust MFEM within the gap of Shiba bands due to the emergence of an effective ``$p_x+p_y$"-type $p$-wave pairing, spatially localized at the edges of a 2D magnetic domain of spin-spiral. We finally verify this concept by considering Mn (Cr) monolayer grown on a $s$-wave superconducting substrate, Nb(110) under strain (Nb(001)). In both 2D cases, the antiferromagnetic spin-spiral solutions exhibit robust MFEM at certain domain edges that is beyond the scope of the trivial extension of 1D spin-chain model in 2D. This approach, particularly when the MFEM appears in the TSC phase for such heterostructure materials, offers a perspective to extend the realm of the TSC in 2D.</description>

      <title>Faraday rotation and transmittance as markers of topological phase transitions in 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the magneto-optical conductivity (and related magnitudes like transmittance and Faraday rotation of the irradiated polarized light) of some elemental two-dimensional Dirac materials of group IV (graphene analogues, buckled honeycomb lattices, like silicene, germanene, stannane, etc.), group V (phosphorene), and zincblende heterostructures (like HgTe/CdTe quantum wells) near the Dirac and gamma points, under out-of-plane magnetic and electric fields, to characterize topological-band insulator phase transitions and their critical points. We provide plots of the Faraday angle and transmittance as a function of the polarized light frequency, for different external electric and magnetic fields, chemical potential, HgTe layer thickness and temperature, to tune the material magneto-optical properties. We have shown that absortance/transmittance acquires extremal values at the critical point, where the Faraday angle changes sign, thus providing fine markers of the topological phase transition. In the case of non-topological materials as phosphorene, a minimum of the transmittance is also observed due to the energy gap closing by an external electric field.</description>

      <title>Probing the state of hydrogen in $\delta$-AlOOH at mantle conditions with machine learning potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrous and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) are a fundamental class of solids of enormous significance to geophysics. They are the water carriers in the deep geological water cycle and impact structural, elastic, plastic, and thermodynamic properties and phase relations in Earth's forming aggregates (rocks). They play a critical role in the geochemical and geophysical processes that shape the planet. Their complexity has prevented predictive calculations of their properties, but progress in materials simulations ushered by machine learning potentials is transforming this state of affairs. Here, we adopt a hybrid approach that combines deep learning potentials (DP) with the SCAN meta-GGA functional to simulate a prototypical hydrous system. We illustrate the success of this approach to simulate $\delta$-AlOOH ($\delta$), a phase capable of transporting water down to near the core-mantle boundary of the Earth (~2,900 km depth and ~135 GPa) in subducting slabs. A high-throughput sampling of phase space using molecular dynamics simulations with DP-potentials sheds light on the hydrogen-bond behavior and proton diffusion at geophysical conditions. These simulations provide a pathway for a deeper understanding of these crucial components that shape Earth's internal state.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nickelate superconductors have attracted a great deal of attention over the past few decades due to their similar crystal and electronic structures with high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that the electronic structure of La4Ni3O10 is very similar to that of La3Ni2O7, suggesting unified electronic properties of nickelates in Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of the $L_{2,3}$ and $M_{2,3}$ edges of Ru in antiferromagnetic RuO$_2$ using a combination of density functional + dynamical mean-field theory and configuration interaction treatment of Anderson impurity model. We study the dependence of the dichroic spectra on the orientation of the N\'eel vector and discuss it in the context of altermagnetism. Approximate equivalence between the XMCD spectra for geometries with X-rays propagating parallel and perpendicular to the N\'eel vector is found and shown to be exact in absence of valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipolar interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted much attention due to the famous, widely adopted interpretation in terms of the Berry curvature dipole in momentum space. Using ab initio Boltzmann transport equations, we find a 60% enhancement in the nonlinear Hall effect of p-doped GeTe and its noticeable frequency dependence, qualitatively different from the predictions based on the Berry curvature dipole. The origin of these differences is long-lived valley polarization in the electron distribution arising from electron-phonon scattering. Our findings await immediate experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Validation of the GreenX library time-frequency component for efficient GW and RPA calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations based on many-body perturbation theory (e.g. GW or the random-phase approximation (RPA)) require function evaluations in the complex time and frequency domain, for example inhomogeneous Fourier transforms or analytic continuation from the imaginary axis to the real axis. For inhomogeneous Fourier transforms, the time-frequency component of the GreenX library provides time-frequency grids that can be utilized in low-scaling RPA and GW implementations. In addition, the adoption of the compact frequency grids provided by our library also reduces the computational overhead in RPA implementations with conventional scaling. In this work, we present low-scaling GW and conventional RPA benchmark calculations using the GreenX grids with different codes (FHI-aims, CP2K and ABINIT) for molecules, two-dimensional materials and solids. Very small integration errors are observed when using 30 time-frequency points for our test cases, namely $&lt;10^{-8}$ eV/electron for the RPA correlation energies, and 10 meV for the GW quasiparticle energies.</description>
