      <title>Retrievals on NIRCam transmission and emission spectra of HD 189733b with PLATON 6, a GPU code for the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 2.4--5.0 \um JWST/NIRCam emission spectrum of HD 189733b, along with an independent re-reduction of the previously published transmission spectrum at the same wavelengths. We use an upgraded version of PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON) to retrieve atmospheric parameters from both geometries. In transit, we obtain [M/H]=$0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ and C/O=$0.41_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$, assuming a power-law haze and equilibrium chemistry with methane depletion. In eclipse, we obtain [M/H]=$0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$ and C/O=$0.43_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$, assuming a clear atmosphere and equilibrium chemistry without methane depletion. These results are consistent with each other, and with a re-run of our previously published joint retrieval of HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra. Accounting for methane depletion decreases the C/O ratio by 0.14/0.04 (transmission/emission), but changing the limb cloud parameterization does not affect the C/O ratio by more than 0.06. We detect H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$S in both the NIRCam transmission and emission spectra, find that methane is depleted on the terminator, and confirm with VULCAN that photochemistry is a potential cause of this depletion. We also find tentative (1.8$\sigma$) evidence of a dayside thermal inversion at millibar pressures. Finally, we take this opportunity to introduce a new version of PLATON. PLATON 6 supports GPU computation, speeding up the code up to 10x. It also supports free retrievals using both volume mixing ratio and centered-log ratio priors; emission from planetary surfaces of different compositions; updated opacities at improved resolution; and Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross validation (PSIS-LOO).</description>

      <title>Near-Earth Asteroids as the parents of the $\delta$-Cancrid Meteoroid Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\delta$-Cancrid meteoroid stream forms four active meteor showers which are observable on the Earth annually during January-February and August-September. The stream's definite parent comet has not been established. We performed a search for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) associated with this stream. We have followed the backward evolution of the orbital elements of a sample of NEAs and found their orbits at the Earth-crossing positions. Using these orbits, we alculated the theoretical parameters of meteor showers associated with the considered NEAs. We carried out our search for observable active showers that match theoretically predicted ones with published data, and the result turned out that the predicted meteor showers of 13 NEAs were identified with the active showers produced by the $\delta$-Cancrid meteoroid stream. The comet-like orbits of NEAs and established association with active meteor showers indicate their common cometary origin. The NEAs considered are moving within the stream and likely represent the dormant remnants of a parent comet of the $\delta$-Cancrid asteroid-meteoroid complex disintegrated more than 12 thousand years ago.</description>

      <title>Prominent mid-infrared excess of the dwarf planet (136472) Makemake discovered by JWST/MIRI indicates ongoing activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of a very prominent mid-infrared (18-25 {\mu}m) excess associated with the trans-Neptunian dwarf planet (136472) Makemake. The excess, detected by the MIRI instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope, along with previous measurements from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes, indicates the occurrence of temperatures of about 150 K, much higher than what solid surfaces at Makemake's heliocentric distance could reach by solar irradiation. We identify two potential explanations: a continuously visible, currently active region, powered by subsurface upwelling and possibly cryovolcanic activity, covering &lt;1% of Makemake's surface, or an as yet undetected ring containing very small carbonaceous dust grains, which have not been seen before in trans-Neptunian or Centaur rings. Both scenarios point to unprecedented phenomena among trans-Neptunian objects and could greatly impact our understanding of these distant worlds.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamic temperatures on pebble dynamics and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. To date, more than 5000 exoplanets have been discovered. The large majority of these planets have a mass between 1 and 17 {M_\oplus}, making them so-called super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. The exact formation process for this abundant planet population has not yet been fully constrained. Aims. Recent studies on the formation of these planets make various assumptions with regard to the disk. The primary mass budget, held in pebbles, is either assumed to have a constant size or is parametrized as a flux. Simplifications of the temperature structure, in the form of a static power law, do not consider the temperature evolution and high magnitudes of heating in the inner part of the disk. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect these simplifications of temperature and pebble sizes have on the pebble densities and resulting planet populations. Methods. To constrain the timescales needed to form super-Earths, we developed a model for exploring a large parameter space. We included the effect of two different temperature prescriptions on a viscously accreting and spreading disk. We formed a pebble reservoir utilizing a simplified conversion timescale with a time- and radially dependent Stokes number for the dust. We then tracked the temporal evolution of the surface densities of gas, dust, and pebbles. Pebbles were allowed to drift and be accreted onto a growing protoplanet. As a planet grows, it exerts a torque on the disk, carving out a gap and affecting the pebble drift, before halting the growth of the planet.</description>

      <title>Reactivity of chondritic meteorites under H2-rich atmospheres: Formation of H2S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models of chemical evolution during star and planetary formation rely on the presence of dust grains to act as a third body. However, they generally ignore the reactivity of the dust grains themselves. Dust grains present in the protoplanetary phase will evolve as the solar system forms and, after protoplanets have appeared, they will be constantly delivered to their surfaces in the form of large aggregates or meteorites. Chondritic meteorites are mostly unaltered samples of the dust present in the first stages of the Solar System formation, that still arrive nowadays to the surface of Earth and allow us to study the properties of the materials forming the early Solar System. These materials contain, amongst others, transition metals that can potentially act as catalysts, as well as other phases that can potentially react in different astrophysical conditions, such as FeS. In this work, we present the reactivity of chondritic meteorites under \hydrogen-rich atmospheres, particularly towards the reduction of FeS for the formation of H2S and metallic Fe during the early phases of the planetary formation. We present the obtained results on the reaction rates and the percentage of FeS available to react in the materials. Additionally, we include a computational study of the reaction mechanism and the energetics. Finally, we discuss the implications of an early formation of H2S in planetary surfaces.</description>

      <title>High Precision Astrometry Science in the Context of Space Mission Prospectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry is one of the oldest branches of astronomy which measures the position, the proper motion and parallax of celestial objects. Following the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that have measured several billions of them using global astrometry, we propose to increase astrometry precision on pointed objects using differential astrometry in a large field in order to unravel rocky planets in habitable zones of stars in the Sun vicinity and investigate the nature of dark matter in galactic environments as recommended by the ESA Senior Committee in the Voyager 2050 prospective. Substantial technology developments in a number of critical areas is needed in order to reach the highest required precision of sub-micro-arcsecond. One of them is CMOS image sensors using the stitching technique to merge the multiple design structures on the wafer and produce array with very large number of pixels. Another one is to calibrate the pixel positions using projecting modulating interferometric laser fringes on the array. Finally, the distortion of the optical system can be monitored and compensated using reference stars as metrology sources. The final precision depends on the diameter and the field of view of the telescope that is used as well as the time spent on each target. We present here the science goals that can be achieved with such missions either within the framework of an ESA Medium-class mission or even in the NASA most challenging Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope recommended by the American Astronomy and Astrophysics prospective for the 2020s and designed specifically to search for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snowline Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a metallicity-dependent enhancement of distant giant companions to close-in small planets in the California Legacy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between close-in small planets (CS) and distant giants (DG) is central to understanding the formation of planetary systems like our own. Most studies of this connection have found evidence for a positive correlation, though significant statistical and systematic uncertainties remain due to differences in sample size, target selection bias, and even the definitions of `close-in small' and `distant giant' planets. Recently, Bryan &amp; Lee (2024) conducted a study of 184 stars hosting super-Earths ($M \sin i = 1-20 \, M_{E}$ or $R = 1-4 \, R_{E}$) to determine the effect of stellar metallicity on the prevalence of distant giant companions ($M \sin i = 0.5-20 \, M_{Jup}$, $a = 1-10$ AU). They found that such giants are twice as common in the presence of inner planets, but \textit{only} in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]&gt;0) = $28^{+4.9}_{-4.6}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]&gt;0) = $14.3 ^{+2.0}_{-1.8}\%$. Further, they found that this correlation disappears for metal-poor stars: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $4.5^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $5.0^{+1.6}_{-1.3}\%$. We conducted an analogous study to test whether this effect was present in the California Legacy Survey sample. Using the same planet definitions, we did not find evidence for an enhancement in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]&gt;0) = $14^{+12}_{-8}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]&gt;0) = $16.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}\%$. We also found a $2\sigma$ tension between our conditional rate and a 2x enhancement. The discrepancy between our findings and theirs may arise from a variety of sources, underscoring the need for large exoplanet surveys to overcome both small number statistics and sample inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Shedding a Light on the Kinetics of the Carboxysulfitic Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way in which we can attempt to relate chemical pathways to geochemical environments is by studying the kinetics of a given sequence of reactions and identifying the conditions under which this chemistry is the most productive. Many prebiotic reactions rely on a source of fixed carbon, therefore chemical pathways that suggest prebiotically plausible ways of fixing carbon are of significant interest. One such pathway is the carboxysulfitic reaction network which uses solvated electrons, produced as a result of electron photodetachment from sulfite, to reduce carbon. In this work we explore carboxysulfitic chemistry at three different pH values: 6, 9, and 12. We utilise a new light source, that matches the broadband spectral shape of the young Sun, to irradiate a mixture of bicarbonate and sulfite. We determine the rate equation for the production of formate from these compounds and find the order to be 0.71 $\pm$ 0.12 with respect to bicarbonate and -0.60 $\pm$ 0.10 with respect to sulfite. Following this, we determine rate constants for the production of formate considering two different mechanisms. We find this chemistry to be feasible at all three of the pH values tested, with the magnitude of the rate constants being highly dependent on the assumed mechanism. We suggest that these results may have implications for Mars Sample Return owing to Jezero Crater having had lakes similar to those in which we propose carboxysulfitic chemistry to have been the most productive. Due to Mars' relatively unaltered surface, we propose that Mars Sample Return missions could look for preserved tracers of this chemistry, shedding light on Mars' past conditions and its potential for having hosted life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>

      <title>How black hole activity may influence exoplanetary evolution in our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of exoplanets have been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, which is also known to harbour a super-massive black hole (Sagittarius A*) at its centre. Here, we investigate how the central black hole (BH) activity may affect the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Accreting BHs emit high-energy radiation -- extreme ultraviolet and X-rays -- which can lead to XUV photoevaporation of the planetary atmospheres. We evaluate the atmospheric mass-loss using both theoretical estimates of the BH radiative output and observational constraints on the past activity history of Sgr A*. The resulting mass-loss is analysed as a function of the galactocentric distance. For the first time, we compute the exoplanet atmospheric evolution under BH irradiation by explicitly including the temporal evolution of the central luminosity output (i.e. the BH activity history). We obtain that Sgr A* could have a major impact on exoplanets located in the inner region of the Galaxy (e.g. Galactic bulge): a significant fraction of the atmospheric mass can be removed by BH irradiation; and in extreme cases, the initial atmosphere may be completely stripped away. Such mass-loss can have important consequences on the atmospheric chemistry and potential biological evolution. We discuss the physical implications for planetary habitability, and we also briefly consider the case of stellar-mass BHs. Overall, accreting black holes may play a significant role in the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>A Population Analysis of 20 Exoplanets Observed from the Optical to the Near-infrared Wavelengths with HST: Evidence for Widespread Stellar Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15505</link>

Abstract: We present a population study of 20 exoplanets, ranging from Neptune-like to inflated hot-Jupiter planets, observed during transit with the STIS and WFC3 instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. To obtain spectral information from the near-UV to the near-infrared, we reanalysed sixteen WFC3 and over fifty STIS archival data sets with our dedicated HST pipeline. We also include twenty-four WFC3 data sets previously reduced with the same software. Across our target sample we observe significant divergence among multiple observations conducted with the same STIS grating at various epochs, whilst we do not detect variations in the WFC3 data sets. These results are suggestive of stellar contamination, which we have investigated further using known Bayesian tools and other tailored metrics, facilitating a more objective assessment of stellar activity intensity within each system. Our findings reveal that stellar activity contaminates up to half of the studied exoplanet atmospheres, albeit at varying extents. Accounting for stellar activity can significantly alter planetary atmospheric parameters like molecular abundances (up to 6 orders of magnitude) and temperature (up to 145 %), contrasting with the results of analyses that neglect activity. Our results emphasise the importance of considering the effects of stellar contamination in exoplanet transit studies; this issue is particularly true for data sets obtained with facilities that do not cover the optical and/or UV spectral range where the activity is expected to be more impactful but also more easily detectable. Our results also provide a catalogue of potentially active stars for further investigation and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Planet Mass Function around M stars at 1-10 au: A Plethora of sub-Earth mass objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small planets ($\lesssim 1$ M$_\oplus$) at intermediate orbital distances ($\sim$1 au) represent an uncharted territory in exoplanetary science. The upcoming microlensing survey by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be sensitive to objects as light as Ganymede and unveil the small planet population at $1-10$ au. Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low and the number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying planet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet mass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble accretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function for M dwarfs ($0.4-0.6 \, M_\odot$) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass function is also expected to be bottom-heavy, skewing towards Ganymede and Mars mass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds. We follow the subsequent dynamical evolution of planetary systems over $\sim$100 Myr varying the initial eccentricity and orbital spacing. For initial planet separations of $\geq$3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets do not grow significantly by mergers. However, Earth-like planets undergo vigorous merging and turn into super-Earths, potentially creating a gap in the planet mass function at $\sim 1$ M$_{\oplus}$. Our results demonstrate that the slope of the mass function and the location of the potential gap in the mass function can probe the initial architecture of multi-planet systems. We close by discussing implications on the expected difference between bound and free-floating planet mass functions.</description>

      <title>Gen TSO: A General JWST Simulator for Exoplanet Times-series Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gen TSO is a noise calculator specifically tailored to simulate James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) time-series observations of exoplanets. Gen TSO enables the estimation of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for transit or eclipse depths through an interactive graphical interface, similar to the JWST Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). This interface leverages the ETC by combining its noise simulator, Pandeia, with additional exoplanet resources from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, the Gaia DR3 catalog of stellar sources, and the TrExoLiSTS database of JWST programs. The initial release of Gen TSO allows users to calculate S/Ns for all JWST instruments for the spectroscopic time-series modes available as of the Cycle 4 GO call. Additionally, Gen TSO allows users to simulate target acquisition on the science targets or, when needed, on nearby stellar targets within the visit splitting distance. This article presents an overview of Gen TSO and its main functionalities. Gen TSO has been designed to provide both an intuitive graphical interface and a modular API to access the resources mentioned above, facilitating planing and simulation of JWST exoplanet time-series observations. Gen TSO is available for installation via the Python Package Index and its documentation can be found at pcubillos.github.io/gen_tso.</description>

      <title>A geometric distortion solution specifically for historical observations and its implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric distortion (GD) critically constrains the precision of astrometry. Using well-established methods to correct GD requires calibration observations, which can only be obtained using a special dithering strategy during the observation period. Unfortunately, this special observation mode is not often used, especially for the historical observations before those GD correction methods presented. As a result, some telescopes have no GD calibration observations for a long period, making it impossible to accurately determine the GD effect. This limits the value of the telescope observations in certain astrometric scenarios, such as using historical observations of moving targets in the solar system to improve their orbits. We investigated a method for handling GD that does not rely on the calibration observations. With this advantage, it can be used to solve the GD models of telescopes which were intractable in the past. The method was implemented in Python and released on GitHub. It was then applied to solve GD in the observations taken with the 1-m and 2.4-m telescopes at Yunnan Observatory. The resulting GD models were compared with those obtained using well-established methods to demonstrate the accuracy. Furthermore, the method was applied in the reduction of observations for two targets, the moon of Jupiter (Himalia) and the binary GSC2038-0293, to show its effectiveness. After GD correction, the astrometric results for both targets show improvements. Notably, the mean residual between observed and computed position (O-C) for the binary GSC2038-0293 decreased from 36 mas to 5 mas.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a rotating massive object. Analysis in terms of osculating and nonosculating (contact) elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>
