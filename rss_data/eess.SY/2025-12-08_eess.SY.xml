      <title>ARCAS: An Augmented Reality Collision Avoidance System with SLAM-Based Tracking for Enhancing VRU Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360-degree 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubled pedestrians' time-to-collision and increased counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided-eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next-generation safety tool for urban mobility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare several representative barrier-like conditions from the literature for infinite-horizon reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems. Our comparison examines both their theoretical properties and computational tractability, highlighting each condition's strengths and limitations that affect applicability and conservativeness. Finally, we illustrate their practical performance through computational experiments using semidefinite programming (SDP) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Adaptive Output Regulation of Unknown Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the linear output regulation problem with both the exosystem and the plant fully unknown. A data-driven regulator is proposed to achieve asymptotic regulation and closed-loop stability without performing model identification. The method constructs a nominal approximate internal model and filters of input and outputs, thereby yielding a stabilizable cascaded nominal system whose states are available. For this nominal system, a stabilizing law is derived from an offline dataset that has been acquired from the plant during experiments, such that the system states exponentially converge to a subspace. An identifier in discrete-time is, then, implemented to correct the internal model and update the stabilizing law; as a result, the regulation error can be steered to zero asymptotically under some persistent excitation conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid modeling approach for better identification of building thermal network model and improved prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gray-box modeling approach, which uses a semi-physical thermal network model, has been widely used in building prediction applications, such as model predictive control (MPC). However, unmeasured disturbances, such as occupants, lighting, and in/exfiltration loads, make it challenging to apply this approach to practical buildings. In this study, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the gray-box model with a model for unmeasured disturbance. After reviewing several system identification approaches, we systematically designed the unmeasured disturbance model with a model selection process based on statistical tests to make it robust. We generated data based on the building model calibrated by real operational data and then trained the hybrid model for two different weather conditions. The Hybrid model approach demonstrates the reduction of RMSE approximately 0.2-0.9C and 0.3-2C on 1-day ahead temperature prediction compared to the Conventional approach for mild (Berkeley, CA) and cold (Chicago, IL) climates, respectively. In addition, this approach was applied for experimental data obtained from the laboratory building to be used for the MPC application, showing superior prediction performances.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Fully Distributed Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although distributed Gaussian process regression (GPR) enables multiple agents with separate datasets to jointly learn a model of the target function, its collaborative nature poses risks of private data leakage. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving fully distributed GPR protocol based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC) that preserves the confidentiality of each agent's local dataset. Building upon a secure distributed average consensus algorithm, the protocol guarantees that each agent's local model practically converges to the same global model that would be obtained by the standard distributed GPR. Further, we adopt the paradigm of simulation based security to provide formal privacy guarantees, and extend the proposed protocol to enable kernel hyperparameter optimization, which is critical yet often overlooked in the literature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solving Multiparametric Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems and Explicit Game-Theoretic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to compute explicit solutions of parametric Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) problems with convex quadratic cost functions and linear coupling and local constraints. Assuming the parameters only enter the linear terms of the cost functions and constraint right-hand sides, we provide the exact multiparametric solution of the GNE problem. Such a solution enables (i) minimal real-time computation, (ii) inherent interpretability, explainability, and exact enumeration of all multiple equilibria, (iii) determine desired GNE solution types in the case of infinitely-many equilibria, and (iv) zero-shot updates of the GNE solution due to changes of constraint right-hand sides and/or linear costs. In line with explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches, we apply our method to solve game-theoretic MPC (Receding Horizon Games) explicitly, comparing performance against centralized solvers in a battery charging game and in a toy two-mass spring system control problem. A Python implementation of the algorithms presented in this paper is available on https://github.com/bemporad/nash_mpqp.</description>

      <title>Constructive boundary observer-based control of high-dimensional semilinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive finite-dimensional output-feedback design for semilinear $M$-dimensional ($M\geq 2$) heat equations with boundary actuation and sensing. A key challenge in high dimensions is the slower growth rate of the Laplacian eigenvalues. The novel features of our modal-decomposition-based design, which allows to enlarge Lipschitz constants, include a larger class of shape functions that may be distributed over a part of the boundary only, the corresponding lifting transformation and the full-order controller gain found from the design LMIs. We further analyze the robustness of the closed-loop system with respect to either multiplicative noise (vanishing at the origin) or additive noise (persistent). Effective LMI conditions are provided for specifying the minimal observer dimension and maximal Lipschitz constants that preserve the stability (mean-square exponential stability for multiplicative noise and noise-to-state stability for additive noise). Numerical examples for 2D and 3D cases demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>PAC One-Step Safety Certification for Black-Box Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of safety certification for black-box discrete-time stochastic systems, where both the system dynamics and disturbance distributions are unknown, and only sampled data are available. Under such limited information, ensuring robust or classical quantitative safety over finite or infinite horizons is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that provides theoretical one-step safety guarantees in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sense. This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for solving the Inverse Stochastic Differential Game (ISDG) problem in finite-horizon linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) differential games. The objective is to recover cost function parameters of all players, as well as noise scaling parameters of the stochastic system, consistent with observed trajectories. The proposed framework combines (i) estimation of the feedback strategies, (ii) identification of the cost function parameters via a novel reformulation of the coupled Riccati differential equations, and (iii) maximum likelihood estimation of the noise scaling parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach recovers parameters, yielding trajectories that closely match the observed trajectories.</description>

      <title>Supervisory Measurement-Guided Noise Covariance Estimation: Discussing Forward and Reverse Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable state estimation depends on accurately modeled noise covariances, which are difficult to determine in practice. This paper formulates the noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization problem that factorizes the joint likelihood of primary and supervisory measurements to reconcile information exploitation with computational tractability. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian dependency into a Markov-chain structure, allowing efficient computation. At the lower level, a Kalman filter with state augmentation performs such computation. Meanwhile, closed-form forward and reverse differentiation provide efficient gradients for the upper-level updates, and we compare the two models' space and time complexities to inform their practical selection. The upper level subsequently refines the noise covariances to guide the lower-level estimation. Taken together, the proposed algorithms offer a systematic and computationally efficient approach to noise covariance estimation in linear Gaussian systems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.</description>

      <title>A Regularization and Active Learning Method for Identification of Quasi Linear Parameter Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an active learning method for designing experiments to identify quasi-Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) models. Since informative experiments are costly, input signals must be selected to maximize information content based on the currently available model. To improve the extrapolation properties of the identified model, we introduce a manifold-regularization strategy that enforces smooth variations in the qLPV dynamics, promoting Linear Time-Varying (LTV) behavior. Using this regularized structure, we propose a new active learning criterion based on path integrals of an inverse-distance variance measure and derive an efficient approximation exploiting the LTV smoothness. Numerical examples show that the proposed regularization enhances qLPV extrapolation and that the resulting active learning scheme accelerates the identification process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present a novel synchronization framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems enabled by neuro-spike communication, which induces emergence. Unlike conventional synchronization strategies that require continuous transmission of full-state data packets, our approach utilizes a bio-inspired neuromorphic amplifier to achieve practical synchronization via intermittent, 1-bit Dirac delta pulses. The proposed method drastically improves communication efficiency in terms of bandwidth and energy by minimizing the information payload to a single bit, with intermittent and asynchronous communication. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and validate the proposed scheme through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>LA-RL: Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning with Safety Guarantees for Autonomous Highway Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous highway driving demands a critical balance between proactive, efficiency-seeking behavior and robust safety guarantees. This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving. Compared to existing SOTA, it achieves approximately 20$\%$ higher success rate than the knowledge graph (KG) based baseline and about 30$\%$ higher than the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based baseline. In low-density environments, LA-RL achieves a 100$\%$ success rate. These results confirm its enhanced exploration of the state-action space and its ability to autonomously adopt more efficient, proactive strategies in complex, mixed-traffic highway environments.</description>

      <title>IMMPC: An Internal Model Based MPC for Rejecting Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful control method that allows to directly include state and input constraints into the controller design. However, errors in the model, e.g., caused by unknown disturbances, can lead to constraint violation, loss of feasibility and deteriorate closed-loop performance. In this paper, we propose a new MPC scheme based on the internal model principle. This enables the MPC to reject unknown disturbances provided that the dynamics of the linear signal generator are known. We reformulate the output regulation problem as a stability problem, to ensure feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and convergence to the optimal reachable setpoint. The controller is validated on a real fourtank system.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition of Impedance Matrices for Understanding the Root Cause of Instabilities in Grid-Connected Power Electronic Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impedance criterion has emerged as an alternative way to stability assessment of grid-connected power electronic converters. However, the lack of physical meaning of impedance and admittance matrices hinders the ability to understand the root cause of instabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of Pauli decomposition to the impedance matrices and the minor loop of grid-connected power electronic converters. The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Trust Evaluation for Multi-Hop Collaborator Selection via GNN-Aided Distributed Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of collaborative task completion among networked devices hinges on the effective selection of trustworthy collaborators. However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion.</description>

      <title>Safe Output Regulation of Coupled Hyperbolic PDE-ODE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safe output regulation control strategy for a class of systems modeled by a coupled $2\times 2$ hyperbolic PDE-ODE structure, subject to fully distributed disturbances throughout the system. A state-feedback controller is developed by the {{nonovershooting backstepping}} method to simultaneously achieve exponential output regulation and enforce safety constraints on the system output, which is the state furthest from the control input. To handle unmeasured PDE states and external disturbances, a state observer and a disturbance estimator are designed. Explicit bounds on the estimation errors are derived and used to construct a robust safe regulator that accounts for the uncertainties. The proposed control scheme guarantees that: 1) If the system output is initially within the safe region, it remains there; otherwise, it will be rescued to the safety within a prescribed time; 2) The output tracking error converges to zero exponentially; 3) The observer accurately estimates both the distributed states and external disturbances, with estimation errors converging to zero exponentially; 4) All signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a UAV delivery scenario with a cable-suspended payload, where the payload is regulated to track a desired reference while avoiding collisions with barriers.</description>

      <title>3D-ICE 4.0: Accurate and efficient thermal modeling for 2.5D/3D heterogeneous chiplet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing power densities and intricate heat dissipation paths in advanced 2.5D/3D chiplet systems necessitate thermal modeling frameworks that deliver detailed thermal maps with high computational efficiency. Traditional compact thermal models (CTMs) often struggle to scale with the complexity and heterogeneity of modern architectures. This work introduces 3D-ICE 4.0, designed for heterogeneous chip-based systems. Key innovations include: (i) preservation of material heterogeneity and anisotropy directly from industrial layouts, integrated with OpenMP and SuperLU MT-based parallel solvers for scalable performance, (ii) adaptive vertical layer partitioning to accurately model vertical heat conduction, and (iii) temperature-aware non-uniform grid generation. The results with different benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 achieves speedups ranging from 3.61x-6.46x over state-of-the-art tools, while reducing grid complexity by more than 23.3% without compromising accuracy. Compared to the commercial software COMSOL, 3D-ICE 4.0 effectively captures both lateral and vertical heat flows, validating its precision and robustness. These advances demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 is an efficient solution for thermal modeling in emerging heterogeneous 2.5D/3D integrated systems.</description>

      <title>Advanced Hybrid Automated Insulin Delivery System based on Successive Linearization Model Predictive Control: The UniBE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and objective: Hybrid automated insulin delivery (hAID) systems represent the most advanced therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Current systems rely on linear or linearized models of glucose homeostasis, which may compromise prediction accuracy and, in turn, timely decision-making by the controller. Physiological variability further complicates insulin requirements, underscoring the need for controllers that adapt dynamically and reduce user burden. Methods: We introduce the University of Bern (UniBE) hAID system, a framework based on successive linearization model predictive control (MPC). The controller integrates basal insulin infusion with the insulin bolus delivery module for meal-related and corrective bolus dosing, adapting bounds in real time to glucose dynamics while accounting for both automated and user-initiated inputs. In-silico evaluation was conducted using the commercial version of the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator across nine scenarios involving persistent and time-varying errors in meal timing, carbohydrate estimation, and basal insulin profiles. Results: In the baseline scenario, UniBE achieved a mean time in range of 92.0+-13.2%, with time below range at 0.1+-0.2% and time above range at 7.9+-13.2%. Across perturbation scenarios, time in range remained between 75.1 and 92.8%, with low hypoglycemia incidence, demonstrating resilience to clinically relevant disturbances.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Dynamic Model for Predicting Human Cognition and Reliance during Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple (12 parameter) hybrid dynamic model that simultaneously captures the continuous-valued dynamics of three human cognitive states-trust, perceived risk, and mental workload-as well as discrete transitions in reliance on the automation. The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods. Our results show that the model fits the observed trajectories well for several participants, with their reliance behavior primarily influenced by trust, perceived risk, or both. Importantly, the model is interpretable, such that the variations in model parameters across participants provide insights into differences in the time scales over which cognitive states evolve, and how these states are influenced by task complexity. Implications on the design of human-centric vehicle automation design are discussed.</description>

      <title>InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Log-linear Dynamic Inversion for Thrusting Spacecraft on SE2(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dynamics of a thrusting spacecraft can be embedded in the Lie group SE2(3) in a form that is group-affine with application of a feed-forward control law. This structure implies that the configuration-tracking error evolves exactly linearly in the associated Lie algebra coordinates (log-linear dynamics), rather than arising from a local linearization of the nonlinear system. As a result, a broad class of linear analysis and synthesis tools becomes directly applicable to powered spacecraft motion on SE2(3). A simple numerical example confirms that the error predicted by the linear Lie-algebra dynamics matches the error computed from the full nonlinear system, illustrating the exact log-linear behavior. This foundational property opens a path toward rigorous tools for satellite docking, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations, robust controller design, and convex safety certification-capabilities that are difficult to achieve with classical local linearizations such as Tschauner-Hempel/Yamanaka-Ankersen (TH/YA).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Parameter Control Using AAN for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoskeletons play a crucial role in assisting patients with varying mobility levels during rehabilitation. However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness in MATLAB/Simulink.</description>

      <title>XR-DT: Extended Reality-Enhanced Digital Twin for Agentic Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Compensation for Safe Kinematic Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art.

      <description>arXiv:2512.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the parameters of a $N$-dimensional stochastic linear dynamics under both full and partial observations from a single trajectory of time $T$. We introduce and analyze a new estimator that achieves a small maximum element-wise error on the recovery of symmetric dynamic matrices using only $T=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ observations, irrespective of whether the matrix is sparse or dense. This estimator is based on the method of moments and does not rely on problem-specific regularization. This is especially important for applications such as structure discovery.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Differential Drive Robots with Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for differential-drive mobile robots with dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, guaranteeing the satisfaction of Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (T-RAS) specifications. The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Initial Point Smoothing and Control Approach to Quantum Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a quantum memory system for storing quantum information in the form of its initial dynamic variables in the presence of environmental noise. In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal.</description>

      <title>A Non-Invasive Path to Animal Welfare: Contactless Vital Signs and Activity Monitoring of In-Vivo Rodents Using a mm-Wave FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring physiological and behavioral parameters of laboratory rodents is fundamental for biomedical research, yet conventional techniques often rely on invasive sensors or frequent handling that can induce stress and compromise data fidelity. To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages. The proposed approach lays the foundation for scalable, automated, and ethical monitoring solutions in preclinical and translational research.</description>

      <title>Executing Discrete/Continuous Declarative Process Specifications via Complex Event Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) focuses on discrete events and fails to incorporate critical continuous sensor data in cyber-physical environments. Hybrid declarative specifications, utilizing Signal Temporal Logic (STL), address this limitation by allowing constraints over both discrete events and real-valued signals. However, existing work has been limited to monitoring and post-hoc conformance checking. This paper introduces a novel Complex Event Processing (CEP)-based execution architecture that enables the real-time execution and enforcement of hybrid declarative models. Our three-layer approach integrates STL-inspired predicates into the execution flow, allowing the system to actively trigger activities and enforce process boundaries based on continuous sensor behavior. This approach bridges the gap between hybrid specification and operational control.</description>

      <title>Scenario-aware Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction with Statistical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification in trajectory prediction is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, yet existing deep learning predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Active Inference for Intelligent UAV Anti-Jamming and Adaptive Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning framework for UAVs operating under adversarial jamming conditions. Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During deployment, the UAV performs online inference to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accordingly, without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Modified global finite-time quasi-continuous second-order robust feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-overshooting quasi-continuous sliding mode control with sub-optimal damping was recently introduced in Ruderman and Efimov (2025) for perturbed second-order systems. The present work proposes an essential modification of the nonlinear control law which (i) allows for a parameterizable control amplitude limitation in a large subset of the initial values, (ii) admits an entire state-space R2 (that was not given in Ruderman and Efimov (2025)) for the finite-time control, and finally (iii) enables for the found analytic solution of the state trajectories in the unperturbed case. The latter allows also for an exact estimation of the finite convergence time, and open an avenue for other potentially interesting analysis of the control properties in the future. For a perturbed case, the solution-based and Lyapunov function-based approaches are developed to show the uniform global asymptotic stability. The proposed robustness and convergence analysis are accompanied by several illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Global stability of vehicle-with-driver dynamics via Sum-of-Squares programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work estimates safe invariant subsets of the Region of Attraction (ROA) for a seven-state vehicle-with-driver system, capturing both asymptotic stability and the influence of state-safety bounds along the system trajectory. Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brunovsky canonical form provides sparse structural representations that are beneficial for computational optimal control, yet existing methods fail to compute it reliably. We propose a technique that produces Brunovsky transformations with substantially lower construction errors and improved conditioning. A controllable linear system is first reduced to staircase form via an orthogonal similarity transformation. We then derive a simple linear parametrization of the transformations yielding the unique Brunovsky form. Numerical stability is further enhanced by applying a deadbeat gain before computing system matrix powers and by optimizing the linear parameters to minimize condition numbers.</description>

      <title>LDLT $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz Network: Generalized Deep End-To-End Lipschitz Network Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated outstanding success in computer vision tasks, attributed to their ability to maintain gradient flow through deep architectures. Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz constant in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research to enhance adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. The $LDL^\top$ formulation is shown to be a tight relaxation of the SDP-based network, maintaining full expressiveness and achieving 3\%-13\% accuracy gains over SLL Layers on 121 UCI data sets.</description>

      <title>Subtransmission Grid Control via Online Feedback Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing electric power consumption and the shift towards renewable energy resources demand for new ways to operate transmission and subtransmission grids. Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a feedback real-time control method that can be employed to enable optimal operation of these grids. Such controllers can maximize grid efficiency (e.g., minimizing curtailment) while satisfying grid constraints like voltage and current limits. The OFO control method is tailored and extended to handle discrete inputs and it is explained how to design an OFO controller for the subtransmission grid. A novel benchmark is presented and published that corresponds to the real French subtransmission grid on which the proposed controller is analyzed in terms of robustness against model mismatch, constraint satisfaction, and tracking performance. It is shown that OFO controllers can help utilize the grid to its full extent, virtually reinforce it, and operate it optimally and in real-time by using the flexibility offered by renewable generators connected to distribution grids.</description>

      <title>Inertia-Constrained Generation Scheduling: Sample Selection, Learning-Embedded Optimization Modeling, and Computational Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Day-ahead generation scheduling is typically conducted by solv-ing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, with fast-growing of inverter-based resources, grid inertia has been dramatically reduced, compromising the dy-namic stability system. Traditional SCUC (T-SCUC), without any inertia requirements, may no longer be effective for renewa-bles-dominated grids. To address this, we propose the active linearized sparse neural network-embedded SCUC (ALSNN-SCUC) model, utilizing machine learning (ML) to incorporate system dynamic performance. A multi-output deep neural net-work (DNN) model is trained offline on strategically-selected data samples to accurately predict frequency stability metrics: locational RoCoF and frequency nadir. Structured sparsity and active ReLU linearization are implemented to prune redundant DNN neurons, significantly reducing its size while ensuring pre-diction accuracy even at high sparsity levels. By embedding this ML-based frequency stability predictor into SCUC as con-straints, the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model minimizes its com-putational complexity while ensuring frequency stability follow-ing G-1 contingency. Case studies show that the proposed ALSNN-SCUC can enforce pre-specified frequency requirements without being overly conservative, outperforming five bench-mark models including T-SCUC, two physics-based SCUC, and two ML-based SCUC. The proposed sparsification and active linearization strategies can reduce the DNN-SCUC computing time by over 95% for both IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Scheduling for High Renewables-Integrated Energy Systems with Battery Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high renewables-integrated power systems, irrespective to their sizes, energy storage is commonly included and utilized to mitigate fluctuations from both the load and renewable power generation, ensuring system reliability, among which battery energy storage system (BESS) are experiencing fast-growth in recent years. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithi-um-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degrada-tion of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degrada-tion; however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, in-troducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery deg-radation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS operational profiles. This approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of day-ahead energy scheduling when integrating battery degradation can thus be substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both small-scale microgrids and large-scale bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed optimal energy scheduling model that can effectively address battery degrada-tion concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling op-erations.</description>

      <title>Levelised Cost of Demand Response: Estimating the Cost-Competitiveness of Flexible Demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To make well-informed investment decisions, energy system stakeholders require reliable cost frameworks for demand response (DR) and storage technologies. While the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) permits comprehensive cost comparisons between different storage technologies, no generic cost measure for the comparison of different DR schemes exists. This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Objective Simultaneous Routing, Facility Location and Allocation Model for Earthquake Emergency Logistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergency preparedness reduces the severity and impact of major disasters. In the case of earthquakes, a rapid and efficient emergency response is essential to reduce the number of fatalities. Therefore, the design and planning of an adequate emergency transportation network are crucial in earthquake-prone locations.
  In the context of emergency transportation modeling, the aim of emergency routing is to find the network with the minimum length that can provide access between the maximum number of Emergency Response Centers (ERCs) and damaged areas. Meanwhile, the goal of the facility location and allocation problem is to optimize the placement of temporary hospitals to increase coverage and accessibility, particularly in remote or severely impacted areas.
  This paper proposes a multi-objective, robust, multi-modal, and multi-time-period optimization problem that simultaneously optimizes routing, facility location, and hospital allocation. The objective function is to minimize unmet commodity demand, unserved injuries, and economic costs. We adopt a fuzzy goal programming approach to solve the multi-objective simultaneous routing, facility location, and allocation model.</description>

Abstract: The design of robust controllers for triple inverted pendulum systems presents significant challenges due to their inherent instability and nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, uncertainties in system parameters further complicate the control design. This paper investigates a robust control strategy for triple inverted pendulums under parameter uncertainty. Two control approaches, namely the $H_\infty$ controller and the $\mu$-synthesis controller, are compared in terms of their ability to achieve reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the $H_\infty$ controller provides superior transient performance, making it a promising solution for the robust stabilization of such complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses certification of closed-loop stability when a virtual-sensor based on a gated recurrent neural network operates in the feedback path of a nonlinear control system. The Hadamard gating used in standard GRU/LSTM cells is shown to violate the Lur\'e-Postnikov Lyapunov conditions of absolute-stability theory, leading to conservative analysis. To overcome this limitation, a modified architecture-termed the Lur\'e-Postnikov gated recurrent neural network (LP-GRNN)-is proposed; its affine update law is compatible with the Lur\'e-Postnikov framework while matching the prediction accuracy of vanilla GRU/LSTM models on the NASA CMAPSS benchmark. Embedding the LP-GRNN, the plant, and a saturated PI controller in a unified standard nonlinear operator form (SNOF) reduces the stability problem to a compact set of tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility certifies global asymptotic stability. A linearized boiler case study illustrates the workflow and validates the closed-loop performance, thereby bridging modern virtual-sensor design with formal stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Age-Structured Competing Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age-structured models capture the dynamic behavior of populations over time and result in nonlinear integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs). These processes arise in various fields such as biotechnology, economics, or demography. While coupled age-structured IPDEs modeling two or more interacting species occur naturally in epidemiology and ecology, they remain relatively underexplored. Prior work has primarily addressed stable and marginally stable dynamics. In constrast, this work considers an exponentially unstable model of two competing predator populations, formally referred to in the literature as ``competition'' dynamics. If one were to apply an input that simultaneously harvests both predator species, one would have control over only the product of the densities of the species, not over their ratio. Therefore, it is necessary to design a control input that directly harvests only one of the two predator species, while indirectly influencing the other via a backstepping approach. The model is transformed into a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), of which only one is actuated, and two autonomous, exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs) which enter the ODEs as nonlinear disturbances. The ODEs are globally stabilized with backstepping and an estimate of the region of attraction of the asymptotically stabilized equilibrium of the full IPDE system is provided, under a positivity restriction on control. Additionally, the full IPDE system is also shown to be local exponential stable. Such generalizations of competition dynamics open exciting possibilities for future research directions for systems with more than two species.</description>

      <title>Generation Expansion Planning with Upstream Supply Chain Constraints on Materials, Manufacturing, and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</description>

      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Communication-Aware Dissipative Control for Networks of Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication-aware control is essential to reduce costs and complexity in large-scale networks. However, it is challenging to simultaneously determine a sparse communication topology and achieve high performance and robustness. This work achieves all three objectives through dissipativity-based, sparsity-promoting controller synthesis. The approach identifies an optimal sparse structure using either weighted l1 penalties or alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) with a cardinality term, and iteratively solves a convexified version of the NP hard structured optimal control problem. The proposed methods are demonstrated on heterogeneous networks with uncertain and unstable agents.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication and Control Co-Design for Multi-Objective Distinct Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a machine-learning approach to learning the semantic dynamics of correlated systems with different control rules and dynamics. By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Automated scanning could make at-scale digitization feasible, unlocking this visual record of the 20th Century for the digital era. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>

      <title>SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited set of behaviors, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leveraging dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Heterogeneous Data: A Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Accelerated ADMM: Automated Parameter Tuning and Improved Linear Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the linear convergence of an accelerated scheme of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth problems. We use the methodology of expressing the accelerated ADMM as a Lur'e system, i.e., an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a slope-restricted operator, and we use Integral Quadratic Constraints to establish linear convergence. In addition, we propose several parameter tuning heuristics and their impact on the convergence rate through numerical analyses. Our new bounds show improved linear convergence rates compared to the vanilla algorithm and previous proposed accelerated variants, which is also empirically validated on a LASSO regression benchmark.</description>
