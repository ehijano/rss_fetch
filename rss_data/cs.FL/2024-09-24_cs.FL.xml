      <title>Declarative Integration and Management of Large Language Models through Finite Automata: Application to Automation, Communication, and Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an innovative architecture designed to declaratively combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with shared histories, and triggers to identify the most appropriate LLM for a given task. Our approach is general and declarative, relying on the construction of finite automata coupled with an event management system. The developed tool is crafted to facilitate the efficient and complex integration of LLMs with minimal programming effort, especially, but not only, for integrating methods of positive psychology to AI. The flexibility of our technique is demonstrated through applied examples in automation, communication, and ethics.</description>

      <title>Advancing Employee Behavior Analysis through Synthetic Data: Leveraging ABMs, GANs, and Statistical Models for Enhanced Organizational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Success in todays data-driven corporate climate requires a deep understanding of employee behavior. Companies aim to improve employee satisfaction, boost output, and optimize workflow. This research study delves into creating synthetic data, a powerful tool that allows us to comprehensively understand employee performance, flexibility, cooperation, and team dynamics. Synthetic data provides a detailed and accurate picture of employee activities while protecting individual privacy thanks to cutting-edge methods like agent-based models (ABMs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and statistical models. Through the creation of multiple situations, this method offers insightful viewpoints regarding increasing teamwork, improving adaptability, and accelerating overall productivity. We examine how synthetic data has evolved from a specialized field to an essential resource for researching employee behavior and enhancing management efficiency. Keywords: Agent-Based Model, Generative Adversarial Network, workflow optimization, organizational success</description>

      <title>A Class of Countably Covered Two-Dimensional Sofic Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multidimensional sofic shift is called countably covered if it has an SFT cover containing only countably many configurations. In contrast to the one-dimensional setting, not all countable sofic shifts are countably covered. We study a subclass of countable shift spaces and characterize the countably covered sofic shifts among them.</description>

      <title>Exploring Error Types in Formal Languages Among Students of Upper Secondary Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundations of formal languages, as subfield of theoretical computer science, are part of typical upper secondary education curricula. There is very little research on the potential difficulties that students at this level have with this subject. In this paper, we report on an exploratory study of errors in formal languages among upper secondary education students. We collect the data by posing exercises in an intelligent tutoring system and analyzing student input. Our results suggest a) instances of non-functional understanding of concepts such as the empty word or a grammar as a substitution system; b) strategic problems such as lack of foresight when deriving a word or confounding formal specifications with real-world knowledge on certain aspects; and c) various syntactic problems. These findings can serve as a starting point for a broader understanding of how and why students struggle with this topic.</description>

      <title>Algebraic power series and their automatic complexity II: modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. We improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description>
