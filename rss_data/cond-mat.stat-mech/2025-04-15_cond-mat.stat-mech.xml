      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)&lt;0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M&lt;0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)&gt;0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous depinning/yielding transition of elastic manifolds with tailored internal elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider elastic manifolds evolving on disordered energy potentials under the action of an external uniform driving. This scenario includes the cases of {\em depinning} and {\em yielding}, which provide paradigmatic examples of out of equilibrium phase transitions. In both cases, velocity of the manifold is zero at low driving force, and increases smoothly when a critical driving is exceeded,defining a continuous flow-curve for these systems. We show that when more general forms of the manifold elasticity are considered, the flow curve may become reentrant, and the transition hysteretic, or discontinuous. This constitutes a novel scenario for a discontinuous transition out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Maxwell's Demon in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent paradox of Maxwell's demon motivated the development of information thermodynamics and, more recently, engineering advances enabling the creation of nanoscale information engines. From these advances, it is now understood that nanoscale machines like the molecular motors within cells can in principle operate as Maxwell demons. This motivates the question: does information help power molecular motors? Answering this would seemingly require simultaneous measurement of all system degrees of freedom, which is generally intractable in single-molecule experiments. To overcome this limitation, we derive a statistical estimator to infer both the direction and magnitude of subsystem heat flows, and thus to determine whether -- and how strongly -- a motor operates as a Maxwell demon. The estimator uses only trajectory measurements for a single degree of freedom. We demonstrate the estimator by applying it to simulations of an experimental realization of an information engine and a kinesin molecular motor. Our results show that kinesin transitions to a Maxwell-demon mechanism in the presence of nonequilibrium noise, with a corresponding increase in velocity consistent with experiments. These findings suggest that molecular motors may have evolved to leverage active fluctuations within cells.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. We introduce the ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally -- the bidirectional machine whose state structure makes explicit all statistical correlations in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurements, in addition to being limited to single measurements the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming these via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to information embedded across sequential measurements. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable information measures that fully characterize a process' informational structure. Additionally, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of highly complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</description>

      <title>Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems exchange heat with their environments and the fluctuations of this heat carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamical processes. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature spin dynamics in the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the infinite temperature dynamical spin structure factor of the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, the relative of the asymmetric Hubbard model. It is characterized by distinct single particle energies for the two spin species, which interact with each other through a contact interaction in momentum space. We evaluate its spin structure factor exactly and follow the evolution of its excitation spectrum for all fillings and interactions, identify signatures of the Mott transition and fingerprints of the asymmetric hoppings. The longitudinal spin structure factor exhibits sound like and interaction induced gapped excitations, whose number gets doubled in the presence of hopping asymmetry. The transverse response displays the competition of interaction and asymmetry induced gaps and results in a quadratic excitation branch at their transition. The complete asymmetric case features momentum-independent dynamical structure factor, characteristic to transitions involving a flat band.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum dynamics are non-equilibrium phase transitions between quantum-chaotic (volume-law entangled) and entanglement-suppressed, area-law phases. We reveal how monitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general far-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced heating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting) monitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based description of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh technique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits, resulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski) mapping. We illustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a conserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all phases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only has an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective non-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry. We show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica symmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica permutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a separatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening" transition between two kinds of dynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the charge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase. Our framework provides a template for other classes of MIPTs and situates these within the arena of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in the systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases. In the former case, it shows a smooth evolution from a non-Gaussian (Poission or binomial distribution) with local dephasing to a Gaussian with global dephasing (quantum microscopic to classical macroscopic) where in late time there is a global symmetry that consists of exponentially many pure states due to the suppressed (stochastic) fluctuation and heating; In the latter case, it shows exponentially many distinct (Krylov) sectors due to the fragmentation and dynamical constrain on Hilbert-space. A gapless-to-gapped transition ((sub)volume law to area-law) during evolution is evident for the former case, where, however, the asymptotic approaching area-law scaling (system-size-independence) even appears in early time with the increasing system-size toward infinity. A novel purifying lasting for a short time is found in the early stage of the former case, during which there is long-range power law decay and scrambling before the Lieb-Robinson bound. Meanwhile, in the latter case, local non-Gaussian interactions (with a large power-law exponent) are present, maintaining an invariant gapless feature. Except a comprehensive study for the both cases, our scheme avoid the interaction effect as well as the selections on measured states due to the measurement apparatus, and thus easier evaluatin on the expectations of non-Hermitian observables</description>

      <title>Emergent facilitation by random constraints in a facilitated random walk model of glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</description>

Abstract: This chapter discusses the conditions and timescales under which isolated many-body quantum systems, initially far from equilibrium, ultimately reach thermal equilibrium. We also examine quantities that, during the relaxation process, exhibit dynamical manifestations of spectral correlations as in random matrix theory and investigate how these manifestations affect their equilibration times. We refer to systems presenting these spectral correlations as chaotic quantum systems, although the correct term to be employed, whether chaotic or ergodic quantum systems, is debatable and both have limitations.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy modeling of Optimal Transport: the sub-optimality regime and the transition from dense to sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a bipartite network model that captures intermediate stages of optimization by blending the Maximum Entropy approach with Optimal Transport. In this framework, the network's constraints define the total mass each node can supply or receive, while an external cost field favors a minimal set of links, driving the system toward a sparse, tree-like structure. By tuning the control parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an optimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges. We quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses that the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength or cost distributions. Finite-size analysis confirms that the results persist in the thermodynamic limit. Because the model offers explicit control over the degree of sub-optimality, this approach lends to practical applications in link prediction, network reconstruction, and statistical validation, particularly in systems where partial optimization coexists with other noise-like factors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling behaviors of free fermions on hyperbolic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized AdS space) have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on $d$-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law ($\sim L^{d-1}$; $L$ is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals (with finite Density-of-State, i.e., DOS) scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law ($\sim L^{d-1}\log L$). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient $c$ is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in inapplicability of these analytic approaches and the potential non-trivial behavior of EE. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating the effect of background hyperbolic geometry that influences quantum entanglement. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex inflation method to generate hyperbolic lattice on the Poincar\'{e} disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to bulk gap in gapped case and to the DOS in gapless case respectively. Future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Colloidal structure, energy extensivity and Monte Carlo sampling properties of improved short-range interaction models for surfactant-coated magnetic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard DLVO theory offers a limited description of ionic-surfacted magnetic colloids in near aggregation regimes. Correcting the electrical double layer term for ionic surfactants is not enough to successfully simulate the systems. The correction of the van der Waals energy divergence at short interparticle distances is fundamental for proper Monte Carlo sampling of nanoparticles' configurations. We compare different short-range interaction models and show that a more detailed model leads to Monte Carlo simulations that better match theoretical expectations. Studying the energy scaling with the number of particles, we observe a slight deviation from energy extensivity across all models, small but still detectable via Akaike's information criterion. The more detailed model predicts a strong effect of particle-size dispersity on the transition between overall attraction and repulsion. More precise modeling can significantly affect numerical predictions, in particular, the effect of particle-size dispersity on the spatial structure of colloids with high volume fraction. This emphasizes the importance of nailing down better models for describing complex colloidal dispersions.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon - a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon - within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>
