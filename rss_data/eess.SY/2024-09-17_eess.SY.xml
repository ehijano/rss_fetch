      <title>Safety Verification and Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles based on Signal Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software architecture behind modern autonomous vehicles (AV) is becoming more complex steadily. Safety verification is now an imminent task prior to the large-scale deployment of such convoluted models. For safety-critical tasks in navigation, it becomes imperative to perform a verification procedure on the trajectories proposed by the planning algorithm prior to deployment. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints can dictate the safety requirements for an AV. A combination of STL constraints is called a specification. A key difference between STL and other logic constraints is that STL allows us to work on continuous signals. We verify the satisfaction of the STL specifications by calculating the robustness value for each signal within the specification. Higher robustness values indicate a safer system. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most widely used methods to control the navigation of an AV, with an underlying set of state and input constraints. Our research aims to formulate and test an MPC controller, with STL specifications as constraints, that can safely navigate an AV. The primary goal of the cost function is to minimize the control inputs. STL constraints will act as an additional layer of constraints that would change based on the scenario and task on hand. We propose using sTaliro, a MATLAB-based robustness calculator for STL specifications, formulated in a receding horizon control fashion for an AV navigation task. It inputs a simplified AV state space model and a set of STL specifications, for which it constructs a closed-loop controller. We test out our controller for different test cases/scenarios and verify the safe navigation of our AV model.</description>

      <title>Direct Data-Driven Discounted Infinite Horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator with Robustness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a one-shot learning approach with performance and robustness guarantees for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control of stochastic linear systems. Even though data-based LQR control has been widely considered, existing results suffer either from data hungriness due to the inherently iterative nature of the optimization formulation (e.g., value learning or policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms) or from a lack of robustness guarantees in one-shot non-iterative algorithms. To avoid data hungriness while ensuing robustness guarantees, an adaptive dynamic programming formalization of the LQR is presented that relies on solving a Bellman inequality. The control gain and the value function are directly learned by using a control-oriented approach that characterizes the closed-loop system using data and a decision variable from which the control is obtained. This closed-loop characterization is noise-dependent. The effect of the closed-loop system noise on the Bellman inequality is considered to ensure both robust stability and suboptimal performance despite ignoring the measurement noise. To ensure robust stability, it is shown that this system characterization leads to a closed-loop system with multiplicative and additive noise, enabling the application of distributional robust control techniques. The analysis of the suboptimality gap reveals that robustness can be achieved without the need for regularization or parameter tuning. The simulation results on the active car suspension problem demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of robustness and performance gap compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Optimal Control Method With Fixed Terminal States and Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free algorithms are brought into the control system's research with the emergence of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, there are two practical challenges of reinforcement learning-based methods. First, learning by interacting with the environment is highly complex. Second, constraints on the states (boundary conditions) require additional care since the state trajectory is implicitly defined from the inputs and system dynamics. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new model-free algorithm based on basis functions, gradient estimation, and the Lagrange method. The favorable performance of the proposed algorithm is shown using several examples under state-dependent switches and time delays.</description>

      <title>Power Oscillation Damping Controllers for Grid-Forming Power Converters in Modern PowerSystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-area oscillations have been extensively studied in conventional power systems dominated by synchronous machines, as well as methods to mitigate them. Several publications have addressed Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controllers in grid-following voltage source converters (GFOL). However, the performance of POD controllers for Grid-Forming voltage source converters (GFOR) in modern power systems with increased penetration of power electronics requires further investigation. This paper investigates the performance of GFORs and supplementary POD controllers in the damping of electromechanical oscillations in modern power systems. This paper proposes POD controllers in GFORs by supplementary modulation of active- and reactive-power injections of the converter and both simultaneously (POD- P, POD-Q and POD-PQ, respectively). The proposed POD controllers use the frequency imposed by the GFOR as the input signal, which has a simple implementation and it eliminates the need for additional measurements. Eigenvalue-sensitivity methods using a synthetic test system are applied to the design of POD controllers in GFORs, which is useful when limited information of the power system is available. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of POD controllers in GFOR converters to damp electromechanical oscillations, by small-signal stability analysis and non-linear time-domain simulations in a small test system and in a large-scale power system.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Graph Transformer Network for Multiple Fault Localization in Naval Shipboard Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of power electronics building blocks in modern MVDC 12kV Naval ship systems enhances energy management and functionality but also introduces complex fault detection and control challenges. These challenges strain traditional fault diagnostic methods, making it difficult to detect and manage faults across multiple locations while maintaining system stability and performance. This paper proposes a temporal recurrent graph transformer network for fault diagnosis in naval MVDC 12kV shipboard systems. The deep graph neural network uses gated recurrent units to capture temporal features and a multi-head attention mechanism to extract spatial features, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The approach effectively identifies and evaluates successive multiple faults with high precision. The method is implemented and validated on the MVDC 12kV shipboard system designed by the ESDRC team, incorporating all key components. Results show significant improvements in fault localization accuracy, with a 1-4% increase in performance metrics compared to other machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Pose estimation of CubeSats via sensor fusion and Error-State Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pose estimation technique based on error-state extended Kalman that fuses angular rates, accelerations, and relative range measurements is presented in this paper. An unconstrained dynamic model with kinematic coupling for a thrust-capable satellite is considered for the state propagation, and a pragmatic measurement model of the rate gyroscope, accelerometer, and an ultra-wideband radio are leveraged for the measurement update. The error-state extended Kalman filter framework is formulated for pose estimation, and its performance has been analyzed via several simulation scenarios. An application of the pose estimator for proximity operations and scaffolding formation of CubeSat deputies relative to their mother-ship is outlined. Finally, the performance of the error-state extended Kalman filter is demonstrated using experimental analysis consisting of a 3-DOF thrust cable satellite mock-up, rate gyroscope, accelerometer, and ultra-wideband radar modules.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization for Traffic Light Control and Connected Automated Vehicle Coordination in Mixed-Traffic Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of coordinating traffic light systems and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed-traffic intersections. We aim to develop an optimization-based control framework that leverages both the coordination capabilities of CAVs at higher penetration rates and intelligent traffic management using traffic lights at lower penetration rates. Since the resulting optimization problem is a multi-agent mixed-integer quadratic program, we propose a penalization-enhanced maximum block improvement algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm, under certain mild conditions, yields a feasible and person-by-person optimal solution of the centralized problem. The performance of the control framework and the distributed algorithm is validated through simulations across various penetration rates and traffic volumes.</description>

      <title>Application of Log-Linear Dynamic Inversion Control to a Multi-rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach that employs log-linearization in Lie group theory and the Newton-Euler equations to derive exact linear error dynamics for a multi-rotor model, and applies this model with a novel log-linear dynamic inversion controller to simplify the nonlinear distortion and enhance the robustness of the log-linearized system. In addition, we utilize Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to bound the tracking error for the log-linearization in the presence of bounded disturbance input and use the exponential map to compute the invariant set of the nonlinear system in the Lie group. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via an illustrative example of a multi-rotor system with a reference trajectory, and the result validates the safety guarantees of the tracking error in the presence of bounded disturbance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment under the Influence of Decision-changing Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-changing imitation is a prevalent phenomenon in financial markets, where investors imitate others' decision-changing rates when making their own investment decisions. In this work, we study the optimal investment problem under the influence of decision-changing imitation involving one leading expert and one retail investor whose decisions are unilaterally influenced by the leading expert. In the objective functional of the optimal investment problem, we propose the integral disparity to quantify the distance between the two investors' decision-changing rates. Due to the underdetermination of the optimal investment problem, we first derive its general solution using the variational method and find the retail investor's optimal decisions under two special cases of the boundary conditions. We theoretically analyze the asymptotic properties of the optimal decision as the influence of decision-changing imitation approaches infinity, and investigate the impact of decision-changing imitation on the optimal decision. Our analysis is validated using numerical experiments on real stock data. This study is essential to comprehend decision-changing imitation and devise effective mechanisms to guide investors' decisions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Dynamic Intervention Design in Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted interventions in games present a challenging problem due to the asymmetric information available to the regulator and the agents. This note addresses the problem of steering the actions of self-interested agents in quadratic network games towards a target action profile. A common starting point in the literature assumes prior knowledge of utility functions and/or network parameters. The goal of the results presented here is to remove this assumption and address scenarios where such a priori knowledge is unavailable. To this end, we design a data-driven dynamic intervention mechanism that relies solely on historical observations of agent actions and interventions. Additionally, we modify this mechanism to limit the amount of interventions, thereby considering budget constraints. Analytical convergence guarantees are provided for both mechanisms, and a numerical case study further demonstrates their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Reactive Environments for Active Inference Agents with RxEnvironments.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Inference is a framework that emphasizes the interaction between agents and their environment. While the framework has seen significant advancements in the development of agents, the environmental models are often borrowed from reinforcement learning problems, which may not fully capture the complexity of multi-agent interactions or allow complex, conditional communication. This paper introduces Reactive Environments, a comprehensive paradigm that facilitates complex multi-agent communication. In this paradigm, both agents and environments are defined as entities encapsulated by boundaries with interfaces. This setup facilitates a robust framework for communication in nonequilibrium-Steady-State systems, allowing for complex interactions and information exchange. We present a Julia package RxEnvironments.jl, which is a specific implementation of Reactive Environments, where we utilize a Reactive Programming style for efficient implementation. The flexibility of this paradigm is demonstrated through its application to several complex, multi-agent environments. These case studies highlight the potential of Reactive Environments in modeling sophisticated systems of interacting agents.</description>

      <title>Three Approaches to the Automation of Laser System Alignment and Their Resource Implications: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of optical systems is a critical step in their manufacture. Alignment normally requires considerable knowledge and expertise of skilled operators. The automation of such processes has several potential advantages, but requires additional resource and upfront costs. Through a case study of a simple two mirror system we identify and examine three different automation approaches. They are: artificial neural networks; practice-led, which mimics manual alignment practices; and design-led, modelling from first principles. We find that these approaches make use of three different types of knowledge 1) basic system knowledge (of controls, measurements and goals); 2) behavioural skills and expertise, and 3) fundamental system design knowledge. We demonstrate that the different automation approaches vary significantly in human resources, and measurement sampling budgets. This will have implications for practitioners and management considering the automation of such tasks.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear System Identification from a Finite Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite sample perspective on the problem of identifying an LTI system from a finite set of possible systems using trajectory data. To this end, we use the maximum likelihood estimator to identify the true system and provide an upper bound for its sample complexity. Crucially, the derived bound does not rely on a potentially restrictive stability assumption. Additionally, we leverage tools from information theory to provide a lower bound to the sample complexity that holds independently of the used estimator. The derived sample complexity bounds are analyzed analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Preventing Unconstrained CBF Safety Filters Caused by Invalid Relative Degree Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are used to certify and modify potentially unsafe control inputs to a system such as those provided by a reinforcement learning agent or a non-expert user. In this context, safety is defined as the satisfaction of state constraints. Originally designed for continuous-time systems, CBF safety filters typically assume that the system's relative degree is well-defined and is constant across the domain; however, this assumption is restrictive and rarely verified -- even linear system dynamics with a quadratic CBF candidate may not satisfy this assumption. In real-world applications, continuous-time CBF safety filters are implemented in discrete time, exacerbating issues related to violating the condition on the relative degree. These violations can lead to the safety filter being unconstrained (any control input may be certified) for a finite time interval and result in chattering issues and constraint violations. We propose an alternative formulation to address these challenges. Specifically, we present a theoretically sound method that employs multiple CBFs to generate bounded control inputs at each state within the safe set, thereby preventing incorrect certification of arbitrary control inputs. Using this approach, we derive conditions on the maximum sampling time to ensure safety in discrete-time implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through simulations and real-world quadrotor experiments, successfully preventing chattering and constraint violations. Finally, we discuss the implications of violating the relative degree condition on CBF synthesis and learning-based CBF methods.</description>

      <title>Bearing-based Target Localisation in Search and Rescue Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the target localisation problem in search and rescue scenarios in which the technology is based on electromagnetic transceivers. The noise floor and the shape of the electromagnetic radiation pattern make this problem challenging. Indeed, on the one hand, the signal-to-noise ratio reduces with the inverse of the distance from the electromagnetic source thus impacting estimation-based techniques applicability. On the other hand, non-isotropic radiation patterns lessen the efficacy of gradient-based policies. In this work, we manage a fleet of autonomous agents, equipped with electromagnetic sensors, by combining gradient-based and estimation-based techniques to speed up the transmitter localisation. Simulations specialized in the ARTVA technology used in search and rescue in avalanche scenarios confirm that our scheme outperforms current solutions.</description>

      <title>To What Extent do Open-loop and Feedback Nash Equilibria Diverge in General-Sum Linear Quadratic Dynamic Games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic games offer a versatile framework for modeling the evolving interactions of strategic agents, whose steady-state behavior can be captured by the Nash equilibria of the games. Nash equilibria are often computed in feedback, with policies depending on the state at each time, or in open-loop, with policies depending only on the initial state. Empirically, open-loop Nash equilibria (OLNE) are often more efficient to compute, while feedback Nash equilibria (FBNE) encode more complex interactions. However, it remains unclear exactly which dynamic games yield FBNE and OLNE that differ significantly and which do not. To address this problem, we present a principled comparison study of OLNE and FBNE in linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games. Specifically, we prove that the OLNE strategies of an LQ dynamic game can be synthesized by solving the coupled Riccati equations of an auxiliary LQ game with perturbed costs. The construction of the auxiliary game allows us to establish conditions under which OLNE and FBNE coincide and derive an upper bound on the deviation between FBNE and OLNE of an LQ game.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control with Applications to Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an approach that integrates reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC) to efficiently solve finite-horizon optimal control problems in mixed-logical dynamical systems. Optimization-based control of such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails the online solution of mixed-integer quadratic or linear programs, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims at mitigating this issue by effectively decoupling the decision on the discrete variables and the decision on the continuous variables. Moreover, to mitigate the combinatorial growth in the number of possible actions due to the prediction horizon, we conceive the definition of decoupled Q-functions to make the learning problem more tractable. The use of reinforcement learning reduces the online optimization problem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear (quadratic) program to a linear (quadratic) program, greatly reducing the computational time. Simulation experiments for a microgrid, based on real-world data, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the online computation time of the MPC approach and that it generates policies with small optimality gaps and high feasibility rates.</description>

      <title>Constrained Learning for Decentralized Multi-Objective Coverage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-objective coverage control problem requires a robot swarm to collaboratively provide sensor coverage to multiple heterogeneous importance density fields (IDFs) simultaneously. We pose this as an optimization problem with constraints and study two different formulations: (1) Fair coverage, where we minimize the maximum coverage cost for any field, promoting equitable resource distribution among all fields; and (2) Constrained coverage, where each field must be covered below a certain cost threshold, ensuring that critical areas receive adequate coverage according to predefined importance levels. We study the decentralized setting where robots have limited communication and local sensing capabilities, making the system more realistic, scalable, and robust. Given the complexity, we propose a novel decentralized constrained learning approach that combines primal-dual optimization with a Learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) neural network architecture. We show that the Lagrangian of the dual problem can be reformulated as a linear combination of the IDFs, enabling the LPAC policy to serve as a primal solver. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method (i) significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art decentralized controllers by 30% on average in terms of coverage cost, (ii) transfers well to larger environments with more robots and (iii) is scalable in the number of fields and robots in the swarm.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Game Theoretic Approach for Coordination of Multiple Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in games provides a powerful framework to design control policies for self-interested agents that may be coupled through their dynamics, costs, or constraints. We consider the case where the dynamics of the coupled system can be modeled as a Markov potential game. In this case, distributed learning by the agents ensures that their control policies converge to a Nash equilibrium of this game. However, typical learning algorithms such as natural policy gradient require knowledge of the entire global state and actions of all the other agents, and may not be scalable as the number of agents grows. We show that by limiting the information flow to a local neighborhood of agents in the natural policy gradient algorithm, we can converge to a neighborhood of optimal policies. If the game can be designed through decomposing a global cost function of interest to a designer into local costs for the agents such that their policies at equilibrium optimize the global cost, this approach can be of interest to team coordination problems as well. We illustrate our approach through a sensor coverage problem.</description>

      <title>Distributed Perception Aware Safe Leader Follower System via Control Barrier Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a distributed leader-follower formation control problem for a group of agents, each using a body-fixed camera with a limited field of view (FOV) for state estimation. The main challenge arises from the need to coordinate the agents' movements with their cameras' FOV to maintain visibility of the leader for accurate and reliable state estimation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perception-aware distributed leader-follower safe control scheme that incorporates FOV limits as state constraints. A Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program is employed to ensure the forward invariance of a safety set defined by these constraints. Furthermore, new neural network based and double bounding boxes based estimators, combined with temporal filters, are developed to estimate system states directly from real-time image data, providing consistent performance across various environments. Comparison results in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in two distinct environments.</description>

      <title>Black-box Stealthy GPS Attacks on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on analyzing the vulnerability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to stealthy black-box false data injection attacks on GPS measurements. We assume that the quadcopter is equipped with IMU and GPS sensors, and an arbitrary sensor fusion and controller are used to estimate and regulate the system's states, respectively. We consider the notion of stealthiness in the most general form, where the attack is defined to be stealthy if it cannot be detected by any existing anomaly detector. Then, we show that if the closed-loop control system is incrementally exponentially stable, the attacker can cause arbitrarily large deviation in the position trajectory by compromising only the GPS measurements. We also show that to conduct such stealthy impactfull attack values, the attacker does not need to have access to the model of the system. Finally, we illustrate our results in a UAV case study.</description>

      <title>A Lane Change Assistance System Based on Prediction of Driver Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane change assistance system increase safety by providing warnings and other stability assistance to drivers to avert traffic dangers. In this contribution, lane change intention recognition was performed and applied to generate warnings for drivers to avoid eminent collision. Previous studies have not yet integrated driver's intended lane change actions as an input for determining when to warn drivers about eminent traffic dangers. Thus, if a driver's intended action may result in a collision, the driver should be warned in advance. In this contribution, lane change to left and right and lane keeping intentions were utilized to warn drivers of potential collision using an audio visual interface. The results indicate reduced risk of collision during lane change to left and right except lane keeping maneuvers. Moreover several participant feedback indicate an increased need for improved warnings by additional situational analysis that anticipate other vehicle behaviors such as intended lane changes.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Low Power Wearable BMI System with Continual Learning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the progress in efficient embedded processing, there is an accelerating trend toward running machine learning models directly on wearable Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) to improve portability and privacy and maximize battery life. However, achieving low latency and high classification performance remains challenging due to the inherent variability of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals across sessions and the limited onboard resources. This work proposes a comprehensive BMI workflow based on a CNN-based Continual Learning (CL) framework, allowing the system to adapt to inter-session changes. The workflow is deployed on a wearable, parallel ultra-low power BMI platform (BioGAP). Our results based on two in-house datasets, Dataset A and Dataset B, show that the CL workflow improves average accuracy by up to 30.36% and 10.17%, respectively. Furthermore, when implementing the continual learning on a Parallel Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller (GAP9), it achieves an energy consumption as low as 0.45mJ per inference and an adaptation time of only 21.5ms, yielding around 25h of battery life with a small 100mAh, 3.7V battery on BioGAP. Our setup, coupled with the compact CNN model and on-device CL capabilities, meets users' needs for improved privacy, reduced latency, and enhanced inter-session performance, offering good promise for smart embedded real-world BMIs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL-based navigation framework for uncertainty estimates in decision-making. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of Deep Ensembles and Monte-Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show that the ODV-PPO algorithm converges faster with better generalization and disentangles the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. In addition, the MC-Dropout approach is more sensitive to perturbations and capable to correlate the uncertainty type to the perturbation type better. With the proposed safe action selection scheme, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</description>

      <title>Underapproximating Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Systems Using Implicit Representations of Backward Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and certifying stability and attractivity of nonlinear systems is a topic of research interest that has been extensively investigated by control theorists and engineers for many years. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel gradient descent-based approach for optimizing control systems, leveraging a new representation of stable closed-loop dynamics as a function of two matrices i.e.   the step size or direction matrix and value matrix of the Lyapunov cost function. This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, quadratic optimization with polytopic constraints, and certain matrix based problems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Partial Observability in Adaptive Traffic Signal Control with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control is essential for managing urban transportation, minimizing congestion, and improving safety and sustainability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems, allowing controllers to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment. However, challenges arise due to partial observability (PO) in traffic networks, where agents have limited visibility, hindering effectiveness. This paper presents the integration of Transformer-based controllers into ATSC systems to address PO effectively. We propose strategies to enhance training efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating improved coordination capabilities in real-world scenarios. The results showcase the Transformer-based model's ability to capture significant information from historical observations, leading to better control policies and improved traffic flow. This study highlights the potential of leveraging the advanced Transformer architecture to enhance urban transportation management.</description>

      <title>Uniform Ergodicity and Ergodic-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic systems, risk-sensitive control balances performance with resilience to less likely events. Although existing methods rely on finite-horizon risk criteria, this paper introduces \textit{limiting-risk criteria} that capture long-term cumulative risks through probabilistic limiting theorems. Extending the Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) framework, we incorporate constraints on these limiting-risk criteria derived from the asymptotic behavior of cumulative costs, accounting for extreme deviations. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the limiting-risk criteria converge under strong ergodicity, and establish conditions for convergence in non-stationary settings while characterizing the distribution and providing explicit formulations for the limiting variance of the risk functional. The FCLT is developed by applying ergodic theory for Markov chains and obtaining \textit{uniform ergodicity} of the controlled process. For quadratic risk functionals on linear dynamics, in addition to internal stability, the uniform ergodicity requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) dynamic noise to have a finite fourth moment. This offers a clear path to quantifying long-term uncertainty. We also propose a primal-dual constrained policy optimization method that optimizes the average performance while ensuring limiting-risk constraints are satisfied. Our framework offers a practical, theoretically guaranteed approach for long-term risk-sensitive control, backed by convergence guarantees and validations through simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast and Post-Quantum Authentication for Real-time Next Generation Networks with Bloom Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale next-generation networked systems like smart grids and vehicular networks facilitate extensive automation and autonomy through real-time communication of sensitive messages. Digital signatures are vital for such applications since they offer scalable broadcast authentication with non-repudiation. Yet, even conventional secure signatures (e.g., ECDSA, RSA) introduce significant cryptographic delays that can disrupt the safety of such delay-aware systems. With the rise of quantum computers breaking conventional intractability problems, these traditional cryptosystems must be replaced with post-quantum (PQ) secure ones. However, PQ-secure signatures are significantly costlier than their conventional counterparts, vastly exacerbating delay hurdles for real-time applications.
  We propose a new signature called Time Valid Probabilistic Data Structure HORS (TVPD-HORS) that achieves significantly lower end-to-end delay with a tunable PQ-security for real-time applications. We harness special probabilistic data structures as an efficient one-way function at the heart of our novelty, thereby vastly fastening HORS as a primitive for NIST PQ cryptography standards. TVPD-HORS permits tunable and fast processing for varying input sizes via One-hash Bloom Filter, excelling in time valid cases, wherein authentication with shorter security parameters is used for short-lived yet safety-critical messages. We show that TVPD-HORS verification is 2.7x and 5x faster than HORS in high-security and time valid settings, respectively. TVPD-HORS key generation is also faster, with a similar signing speed to HORS. Moreover, TVPD-HORS can increase the speed of HORS variants over a magnitude of time. These features make TVPD-HORS an ideal primitive to raise high-speed time valid versions of PQ-safe standards like XMSS and SPHINCS+, paving the way for real-time authentication of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>3DIOC: Direct Data-Driven Inverse Optimal Control for LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a direct data-driven inverse optimal control (3DIOC) algorithm for the linear time-invariant (LTI) system who conducts a linear quadratic (LQ) control, where the underlying objective function is learned directly from measured input-output trajectories without system identification. By introducing the Fundamental Lemma, we establish the input-output representation of the LTI system. We accordingly propose a model-free optimality necessary condition for the forward LQ problem to build a connection between the objective function and collected data, with which the inverse optimal control problem is solved. We further improve the algorithm so that it requires a less computation and data. Identifiability condition and perturbation analysis are provided. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Analysis of ADMM-based Suboptimal Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many practical applications of optimal control are subject to real-time computational constraints. When applying model predictive control (MPC) in these settings, respecting timing constraints is achieved by limiting the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm used to compute control actions at each time step, resulting in so-called suboptimal MPC. This paper proposes a suboptimal MPC scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). With a focus on the linear quadratic regulator problem with state and input constraints, we show how ADMM can be used to split the MPC problem into iterative updates of an unconstrained optimal control problem (with an analytical solution), and a dynamics-free feasibility step. We show that using a warm-start approach combined with enough iterations per time-step, yields an ADMM-based suboptimal MPC scheme which asymptotically stabilizes the system and maintains recursive feasibility.</description>

      <title>Online 4D Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Tracking Enables 3D Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy with Large Tissue Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Hypothesis Testing by Two Observers with Asymmetric Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.11612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the binary hypothesis testing problem with two observers. There are two possible states of nature (or hypotheses). Observations collected by the two observers are statistically related to the true state of nature. The knowledge of joint distribution of the observations collected and the true state of nature is unknown to the observers. There are two problems to be solved by the observers: (i) true state of nature is known: find the distribution of the local information collected; (ii) true state of nature is unknown: collaboratively estimate the same using the distributions found by solving the first problem. We present four algorithms, each having two phases where the two problems are solved, with emphasis on the information exchange between the observers and resulting patterns. We prove different properties of the algorithms including the following: the probability spaces constructed as a consequence of solving the first problem are dependent on the information patterns at the observers; (ii) the rate of decay of probability of error of algorithms while solving the second problem is dependent on the information exchange between the observers. We present a numerical example demonstrating the four algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Online Learning for Multi-Agent System Control via Gaussian Processes with Event-Triggered Mechanism: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of the cooperative control of multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown dynamics, Gaussian process (GP) regression is widely used to infer the uncertainties due to its modeling flexibility of nonlinear functions and the existence of a theoretical prediction error bound. Online learning, which involves incorporating newly acquired training data into Gaussian process models, promises to improve control performance by enhancing predictions during the operation. Therefore, this paper investigates the online cooperative learning algorithm for MAS control. Moreover, an event-triggered data selection mechanism, inspired by the analysis of a centralized event-trigger, is introduced to reduce the model update frequency and enhance the data efficiency. With the proposed learning-based control, the practical convergence of the MAS is validated with guaranteed tracking performance via the Lynaponve theory. Furthermore, the exclusion of the Zeno behavior for individual agents is shown. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered online learning method is demonstrated in simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new paradigm is proposed for the robustification of the LQG controller against distributional uncertainties on the noise process. Our controller optimizes the closed-loop performances in the worst possible scenario under the constraint that the noise distributional aberrance does not exceed a certain threshold limiting the relative entropy pseudo-distance between the actual noise distribution the nominal one. The main novelty is that the bounds on the distributional aberrance can be arbitrarily distributed along the whole disturbance trajectory. We discuss why this can, in principle, be a substantial advantage and we provide simulation results that substantiate such a principle.</description>

      <title>Functional Observability, Structural Functional Observability and Optimal Sensor Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, new characterizations for functional observability, functional detectability, and structural functional observability (SFO) are developed, and based on them, the related optimal sensor placement problems are investigated. A novel concept of modal functional observability coinciding with the notion of modal observability is proposed. This notion introduces necessary and sufficient conditions for functional observability and detectability in a unified way without resorting to system observability decomposition, and facilitates the design of a functionally observable/detectable system. Afterwards, SFO is redefined rigorously from a generic perspective, contrarily to the definition of structural observability. A complete graph-theoretic characterization for SFO is proposed. Based on these results, the problems of selecting the minimal sensors from a prior set to achieve functional observability and SFO are shown to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, supermodular set functions are established, leading to greedy heuristics that can find approximation solutions to these problems with provable guarantees in polynomial time. A closed-form solution along with a constructive procedure is also given for the unconstrained case on systems with diagonalizable state matrices. Notably, our results also yield a polynomial-time verifiable case for structural target controllability, a problem that may be hard otherwise.</description>

      <title>System-Wide Emergency Policy for Transitioning from Main to Secondary Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faced with the complexities of managing natural gas-dependent power system amid the surge of renewable integration and load unpredictability, this study explores strategies for navigating emergency transitions to costlier secondary fuels. Our aim is to develop decision-support tools for operators during such exigencies. We approach the problem through a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, accounting for multiple uncertainties. These include the potential for dual-fuel generator failures and operator response during high-pressure situations. Additionally, we consider the finite reserves of primary fuel, governed by gas-flow partial differential equations (PDEs) and constrained by nodal pressure. Other factors include the variability in power forecasts due to renewable generation and the economic impact of compulsory load shedding. For tractability, we address the MDP in a simplified context, replacing it by Markov Processes evaluated against a selection of policies and scenarios for comparison. Our study considers two models for the natural gas system: an over-simplified model tracking linepack and a more nuanced model that accounts for gas flow network heterogeneity. The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated using a realistic model replicating Israel's power-gas infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Layer-to-Layer Melt Pool Control in Laser Powder Bed Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing processes are flexible and efficient technologies for producing complex geometries. However, ensuring reliability and repeatability is challenging due to the complex physics and various sources of uncertainty in the process. In this work, we investigate closed-loop control of the melt pool dimensions in a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. We propose a trajectory optimization-based layer-to-layer controller that adjusts the laser power input to the next layer to track a desired melt pool depth and validate our controller by placing it in closed-loop high-fidelity multi-layer smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulator of a 2D LPBF process. Detailed numerical case studies demonstrate successful regulation of the melt pool depth on brick and overhang geometries and provide first of its kind results on the effectiveness of layer-to-layer input optimization for the LPBF process as well as detailed insight into the physics of the controlled process. Computational complexity and process performance results illustrate the method's effectiveness and provide an outlook for its implementation onto real systems.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Market Mechanism for Energy Communities under Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an operating envelopes (OEs) aware energy community market mechanism that dynamically charges/rewards its members based on two-part pricing. The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter and is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community operator and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters such as NEM rates and OEs on the value of joining the community. Lastly, through numerical studies, we showcase the community's welfare, and pricing, and compare its members' surplus to customers under the DSO's regime.</description>

      <title>A Baseline Approach for Modeling and Characterization of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Droop Controlled Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to advancements in power electronics, new converter topologies are introduced day by day. It's hard to get an equivalent model from any manufacturer of any Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) power electronics converters because of intellectual property (IP) and safety concerns. Most COTS products don't reveal the exact topology of the converter as well as the control architecture and corresponding control gains. Because of these reasons, it's very hard to implement an exact equivalent model of COTS converters. Hierarchical control is widely used in microgrid applications, where different control layers are decoupled on the timescale. This article gives a baseline approach to build an equivalent model of any droop controlled COTS converter to mimic its control performance. Bandwidths of the different control loops are estimated along with the control logic from experiments on COTS converter and then hierarchical control is followed to come up with the equivalent model. The approach is verified on COTS CE+T Stabiliti 30C3 converter with its equivalent model build in MATLAB Simulink.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DC microgrids are getting more and more applications due to simple converters, only voltage control and higher efficiencies compared to conventional AC grids. Droop control is a well know decentralized control strategy for power sharing among converter interfaced sources and loads in a DC microgrid. This work compares the stability assessment and control of four types of droops for boost converters using the concept of passivity. EN standard 50388-2 for railway systems provides a reference to ensure system stability in perspectives of converters and system integration. Low pass filter (LPF) in the feedback of the droop control is used to ensure converter passivity. Bus impedance is derived to ensure system passivity with less conservativeness. Analytical approach for design of passive controller for all four types of droops is verified through time domain simulations of a single boost converter based microgrid feeding a Constant Power Load (CPL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of rocket technology, the latch valve assumes a pivotal role in regulating the flow of fuel gases and liquids to ensure the requisite energy supply. This project endeavors to innovate by replacing the conventional step motor mechanism with a servo motor for latch valve control. The selected servo motor, boasting a more compact form factor and reduced mass, aligns seamlessly with the project's overarching objectives. While servo motors offer myriad advantages, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the constraints of their maximum output torque to guarantee the latch valve's reliable operation. Furthermore, as a rocket ascends, it encounters significant fluctuations in internal temperature and pressure. Consequently, rigorous environmental testing becomes paramount to validate the servo motor's performance under these dynamic conditions, thus ensuring the latch valve's unwavering functionality. The primary focus of this project is the design and testing of the mechanism's performance in simulated rocket environments, achieved through the implementation of the servo motor for latch valve control. The results reveal that the servo motor demonstrated its effectiveness and reliability in controlling the latch valve under the rigorous environmental conditions of rocket flight.</description>

Abstract: In response to escalating global drinking water scarcity we propose an innovative, automatic system for reusing clean sink water to flush toilets. Existing solutions for water recycle in the houses involve purifiers and complex treatments, leading to high costs and constant maintenance.

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating System-Level Anomalies of Vision-Based Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, have made significant strides in recent years by leveraging visual inputs and machine learning for decision-making and control. Despite their impressive performance, these vision-based controllers can make erroneous predictions when faced with novel or out-of-distribution inputs. Such errors can cascade to catastrophic system failures and compromise system safety. In this work, we introduce a run-time anomaly monitor to detect and mitigate such closed-loop, system-level failures. Specifically, we leverage a reachability-based framework to stress-test the vision-based controller offline and mine its system-level failures. This data is then used to train a classifier that is leveraged online to flag inputs that might cause system breakdowns. The anomaly detector highlights issues that transcend individual modules and pertain to the safety of the overall system. We also design a fallback controller that robustly handles these detected anomalies to preserve system safety. We validate the proposed approach on an autonomous aircraft taxiing system that uses a vision-based controller for taxiing. Our results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying and handling system-level anomalies, outperforming methods such as prediction error-based detection, and ensembling, thereby enhancing the overall safety and robustness of autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling epidemic spread is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigation. Accordingly, in this work we present a new data-driven method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model epidemic spread. We bound the variance of the predictions made by GPR, which quantifies the impact of epidemic data on the proposed model. Next, we derive a high-probability error bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has 94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating these predictions.</description>

      <title>Fast Long-Term Multi-Scenario Prediction for Maneuver Planning at Unsignalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion prediction for intelligent vehicles typically focuses on estimating the most probable future evolutions of a traffic scenario. Estimating the gap acceptance, i.e., whether a vehicle merges or crosses before another vehicle with the right of way, is often handled implicitly in the prediction. However, an infrastructure-based maneuver planning can assign artificial priorities between cooperative vehicles, so it needs to evaluate many more potential scenarios. Additionally, the prediction horizon has to be long enough to assess the impact of a maneuver. We, therefore, present a novel long-term prediction approach handling the gap acceptance estimation and the velocity prediction in two separate stages. Thereby, the behavior of regular vehicles as well as priority assignments of cooperative vehicles can be considered. We train both stages on real-world traffic observations to achieve realistic prediction results. Our method has a competitive accuracy and is fast enough to predict a multitude of scenarios in a short time, making it suitable to be used in a maneuver planning framework.</description>

      <title>Age of $k$-out-of-$n$ Systems on a Gossip Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider information update systems on a gossip network, which consists of a single source and $n$ receiver nodes. The source encrypts the information into $n$ distinct keys with version stamps, sending a unique key to each node. For decoding the information in a $k$-out-of-$n$ system, each receiver node requires at least $k+1$ different keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. Each node determines $k$ based on a given function, ensuring that as $k$ increases, the precision of the decoded information also increases. We consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the ''timeliness'' of information updates by using the $k$-keys version age of information. Our work focuses on determining closed-form expressions for the time average age of information in a heterogeneous random graph under both with memory and memoryless schemes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in simulation domains, yet its application in designing robot controllers remains limited, due to its single-task orientation and insufficient adaptability to environmental changes. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel adaptive agent that leverages transfer learning techniques to dynamically adapt policy in response to different tasks and environmental conditions. The approach is validated through the blimp control challenge, where multitasking capabilities and environmental adaptability are essential. The agent is trained using a custom, highly parallelized simulator built on IsaacGym. We perform zero-shot transfer to fly the blimp in the real world to solve various tasks. We share our code at \url{https://github.com/robot-perception-group/adaptive\_agent/}.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Machine Learning-Enabled Optimization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided 6G Networks: From Reinforcement Learning to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) becomes a promising technique for 6G networks by reshaping signal propagation in smart radio environments. However, it also leads to significant complexity for network management due to the large number of elements and dedicated phase-shift optimization. In this work, we provide an overview of machine learning (ML)-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks. In particular, we focus on various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, e.g., deep Q-learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and offline reinforcement learning. Different from existing studies, this work further discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be combined with RL to handle network optimization problems. It shows that LLM offers new opportunities to enhance the capabilities of RL algorithms in terms of generalization, reward function design, multi-modal information processing, etc. Finally, we identify the future challenges and directions of ML-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection for agents on power grid topology optimization: A Comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the topology of transmission networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has increasingly come into focus. Various DRL agents have been proposed, which are mostly benchmarked on the Grid2Op environment from the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. The environments have many advantages with their realistic grid scenarios and underlying power flow backends. However, the interpretation of agent survival or failure is not always clear, as there are a variety of potential causes. In this work, we focus on the failures of the power grid simulation to identify patterns and detect them in advance. We collect the failed scenarios of three different agents on the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, totaling about 40k data points. By clustering, we are able to detect five distinct clusters, identifying common failure types. Further, we propose a multi-class prediction approach to detect failures beforehand and evaluate five different prediction models. Here, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) shows the best failure prediction performance, with an accuracy of 82%. It also accurately classifies whether a the grid survives or fails in 87% of cases. Finally, we provide a detailed feature importance analysis that identifies critical features and regions in the grid.</description>

      <title>Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraints states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description>
