      <title>Mass-Zero constrained molecular dynamics for electrostatic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal exploitation of supercomputing resources for the evaluation of electrostatic forces remains a challenge in molecular dynamics simulations of very large systems. The most efficient methods are currently based on particle-mesh Ewald sums and achieve semi-logarithmic scaling in the number of particles. These methods, however, solve the problem in reciprocal space, requiring extensive use of Fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The communication overhead associated with FFTs is a well-known bottleneck for high-end parallelization. In this work, we introduce a novel real-space approach to solve the Poisson equation on a grid. Our method exploits an extended Lagrangian in which the values of the field at the grid points are treated as auxiliary variables of zero inertia, and the discretized Poisson equation is enforced as dynamical constraint. We first analyze the method using a toy model, and then consider realistic simulations of molten NaCl that validate its ability to reproduce structural and transport properties, and showcase the features of our algorithm on a non-trivial benchmark. Finally, we discuss the computational performance and scaling behavior of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on charge transfer properties of triphenylamino-ethynyl Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the regulation mechanisms of backbone topology (tri-/tetracyclic arenes), substitution positions, and functional groups on charge transport properties through molecular design of triphenylamine-ethynylene fused acene derivatives. By integrating Marcus charge transfer theory with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that sulfur-doped tricyclic arene backbones (benzodithiophene and anthracene) effectively suppress high-frequency vibrational modes reducing reorganization energy to 146.1 meV. Concurrent optimization of intermolecular $\pi$-$\pi$ slippage enhances 2D hole mobility. Notably, asymmetric charge transport pathways in 2,7-disubstituted pyrene(27DTEP) decrease transfer integrals by 34%, while 1,6-substitution (16DTEP)reconstructs HOMO orbital distribution and induces rotational stacking, boosting transfer integrals by 28% and improving mobility isotropy. We further propose a "backbone-functional group synergy" strategy, revealing that concentrated orbital localization on the backbone amplifies transfer integral gains, outweighing the 38% increase in reorganization energy and significantly enhancing mobility. These findings establish a theoretical framework and quantitative model for the rational design of high-mobility organic ultraviolet photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Maxwell \`a la Helmholtz: Electromagnetic scattering by 3D perfect electric conductors via Helmholtz integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of indirect boundary integral equation (BIE) formulations for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems involving smooth perfectly electric conductors (PECs) in three-dimensions. These combined-field-type BIE formulations rely exclusively on classical Helmholtz boundary operators, resulting in provably well-posed, frequency-robust, Fredholm second-kind BIEs. Notably, we prove that the proposed formulations are free from spurious resonances, while retaining the versatility of Helmholtz integral operators. The approach is based on the equivalence between the Maxwell PEC scattering problem and two independent vector Helmholtz boundary value problems for the electric and magnetic fields, with boundary conditions defined in terms of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces of the corresponding vector Helmholtz solutions. While certain aspects of this equivalence (for the electric field) have been previously exploited in the so-called field-only BIE formulations, we here rigorously establish and generalize the equivalence between Maxwell and Helmholtz problems for both fields. Finally, a variety of numerical examples highlights the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach when combined with Density Interpolation-based Nystr\"om methods and fast linear algebra solvers, implemented in the open-source Julia package Inti.jl.</description>

      <title>xChemAgents: Agentic AI for Explainable Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties. However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22\% reduction in mean absolute error over strong baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The implementation and accompanying dataset are available anonymously at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/xChemAgents.</description>

      <title>Seeing through the light cone: Visualizing electromagnetic fields in special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical framework of electromagnetism played a foundational role in Einstein's development of special relativity. To support conceptual understanding, we present a fully special relativistic computer simulation that visualizes electromagnetic fields from the perspective of a moving observer. In this simulation, the user observes electromagnetic phenomena through their past light cone and directly experiences the Lorentz force acting at that spacetime point. The electromagnetic field is computed from the subluminal motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the observer's past light cone, ensuring causal consistency and Lorentz covariance. This approach offers an interactive and intuitive representation of relativistic electromagnetism. It provides insight into how electric and magnetic fields transform across inertial frames, and serves as a bridge between abstract formalism and physical intuition. The simulation also lends itself to pedagogical use in courses on special relativity or electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential. Simulations are carried out under a temperature ramp for determining all possible products. Using this methodology, reaction pathways of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the MAGICARP algorithm, a numerical optimization method for quantum optimal control problems that combines the structure provided by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and the robustness of gradient ascent techniques, such as GRAPE. MAGICARP is formulated as a "shooting technique", aiming to determine the appropriate initial adjoint momentum to realize a target quantum gate. This method naturally incorporates time and energy optimal constraints through a PMP-informed pulse structure. We demonstrate MAGICARP's effectiveness through illustrative numerical examples, comparing its performance to GRAPE and highlighting its advantages in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>From Polyhedra to Crystals: A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Crystal Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structures can be viewed as assemblies of space-filling polyhedra, which play a critical role in determining material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional crystal structure prediction methods rely on random structure generation and do not explicitly incorporate polyhedral tiling, limiting their efficiency and interpretability. In this highlight, we introduced a novel crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedral information. The geometry and topology of space-filling polyhedra are encoded as a dual periodic graph, and the corresponding crystal structure is obtained via the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures from their dual periodic graphs. This method offers a new pathway for systematically generating crystal structures based on target polyhedra, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel materials for applications in electronics, energy storage, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Regression for conformer ensembles made easy with Structured Orthogonal Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient protocol for machine learning in chemical space using Boltzmann ensembles of conformers as input is proposed; the method is based on rewriting Kernel Ridge Regression expressions in terms of Structured Orthogonal Random Features, yielding physics-motivated trigonometric neural networks. The resulting method is tested on experimental datasets of oxidation potentials in acetonitrile and hydration energies, using several popular molecular representations to demonstrate the method's flexibility. Despite only using computationally cheap forcefield calculations for conformer generation, we observe systematic decrease of machine learning error with increased training set size in all cases, with experimental accuracy reached after training on hundreds of molecules and prediction errors being comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. We also present novel versions of Huber and LogCosh loss functions that made hyperparameter optimization of the new approach more convenient.</description>

      <title>Strain controlled g- to d-wave transition in altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of a strain-induced transformation from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism was recently recently proposed for MnTe using a $k\cdot p$ perturbative model. In this work, we demonstrate such a transition in CrSb for a wider array of strains, using a combination of a minimal model and first-principles calculations. Starting from a symmetry perspective, we analyze the spin elastoconductivity tensor, and determine the strain types which allow for a change in the altermagnetic symmetry. We obtain three strain directions, which allow for a $d$-wave type splitting, and one in which a net magnetic moment emerges. Using first-principles calculations in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we confirm these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, these results do not alter qualitatively in the presence of SOC. Finally, we reveal that the resulting spin currents give rise to a spin-splitter effect of up to 5\% under realistic strains of 1\%, confirming strain as a powerful tool for tuning altermagnetic properties.</description>

Abstract: While dissipation has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to quantum coherence, it is increasingly recognized as a powerful computational resource. Dissipative protocols can prepare complex many-body quantum states by leveraging engineered system-environment interactions. This essay focuses on a class of algorithms that utilize algorithmically constructed Lindblad generators, and highlight recent advances enabling the preparation of ground and thermal states for certain non-commuting Hamiltonians with rigorous performance guarantees. We also propose extensions of these protocols to prepare excited and resonance states, which may offer new pathways toward realizing practical quantum advantage on early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>A Hyperbolic Approximation of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a first-order hyperbolic approximation of
  the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. We show that the system
  is strictly hyperbolic and possesses a modified Hamiltonian structure, along with
  at least three conserved quantities that approximate those of NLS.
  We provide families of explicit standing-wave solutions to the hyperbolic system,
  which are shown to converge uniformly to ground-state solutions
  of NLS in the relaxation limit.
  The system is formally equivalent to NLS in the relaxation limit, and we
  develop asymptotic preserving discretizations that tend to a consistent discretization
  of NLS in that limit, while also conserving mass.
  Examples for both the focusing and defocusing regimes demonstrate that the
  numerical discretization provides an accurate approximation of the NLS
  solution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of relativistic electromagnetism, focusing on the computation of electromagnetic fields from moving charges in a manifestly Lorentz-covariant manner. The electromagnetic field at a given spacetime point is determined by the motion of point charges at the intersection of their worldlines with the past light cone of the spacetime point, ensuring causal consistency. This formalism provides a manifestly covariant generalization of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials and allows direct implementation on computers. We compare our formulation with standard textbook approaches and analyze its behavior in various physical limits.</description>

      <title>Statistical Finite Elements via Interacting Particle Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a class of interacting particle Langevin algorithms to solve inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we leverage the statistical finite elements (statFEM) formulation to obtain a finite-dimensional latent variable statistical model where the parameter is that of the (discretised) forward map and the latent variable is the statFEM solution of the PDE which is assumed to be partially observed. We then adapt a recently proposed expectation-maximisation like scheme, interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), for this problem and obtain a joint estimation procedure for the parameters and the latent variables. We consider three main examples: (i) estimating the forcing for linear Poisson PDE, (ii) estimating diffusivity for linear Poisson PDE, and (iii) estimating the forcing for nonlinear Poisson PDE. We provide computational complexity estimates for forcing estimation in the linear case. We also provide comprehensive numerical experiments and preconditioning strategies that significantly improve the performance, showing that the proposed class of methods can be the choice for parameter inference in PDE models.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium</title>

Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>
