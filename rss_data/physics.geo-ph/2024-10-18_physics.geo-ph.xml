      <title>Annealed Stein Variational Gradient Descent for Improved Uncertainty Estimation in Full-Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) has been extensively used to derive high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic data. However, due to the nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of the problem, FWI requires a good starting model to avoid producing non-physical solutions. Moreover, conventional optimization methods fail to quantify the uncertainty associated with the recovered solution, which is critical for decision-making processes. Bayesian inference offers an alternative approach as it directly or indirectly evaluates the posterior probability density function. For example, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods generate multiple sample chains to characterize the solution's uncertainty. Despite their ability to theoretically handle any form of distribution, MCMC methods require many sampling steps; this limits their usage in high-dimensional problems with computationally intensive forward modeling, as is the FWI case. Variational Inference (VI), on the other hand, provides an approximate solution to the posterior distribution in the form of a parametric or non-parametric proposal distribution. Among the various algorithms used in VI, Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is recognized for its ability to iteratively refine a set of samples to approximate the target distribution. However, mode and variance-collapse issues affect SVGD in high-dimensional inverse problems. This study aims to improve the performance of SVGD within the context of FWI by utilizing, for the first time, an annealed variant of SVGD and combining it with a multi-scale strategy. Additionally, we demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to evaluate the performance of the optimization process. Clustering techniques are also employed to provide more rigorous and meaningful statistical analysis of the particles in the presence of multi-modal distributions.</description>

      <title>Elementary theory of earthquake source relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elementary theory of relaxation of the source cooling down after the main shock of an earthquake is presented axiomatically. The names of the objects under study are given and the relationships between them are determined. A new basic concept of earthquake source deactivation is introduced and a procedure for calculating the deactivation coefficient from aftershock frequency measurement data is indicated. An important property of the system is that the axioms do not contain statements regarding the actual process of source relaxation. From two simple axioms a number of meaningful statements (theorems) logically follow. A two-stage mode of source relaxation was discovered. The sharp transition between stages has the character of a bifurcation. It is shown that the classical Omori law has limited applicability. It describes the evolution of aftershocks only at the first stage of relaxation. The well-known Hirano-Utsu law is not applicable to describe aftershocks either at the first or second stages of relaxation. The conclusions of the elementary theory allow for interesting generalizations that expand the possibilities of experimental and theoretical study of the source. Keywords: earthquake source, foreshocks, main shock, aftershocks, source state, deactivation coefficient, bifurcation, Omori's law, Hirano-Utsu's law.</description>

      <title>Applying Astronomical Solutions and Milankovi{\'c} Forcing in the Earth Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical solutions provide calculated orbital and rotational parameters of solar system bodies based on the dynamics and physics of the solar system. Application of astronomical solutions in the Earth sciences has revolutionized our understanding in at least two areas of active research. (i) The Astronomical (or Milankovic) forcing of climate on time scales &gt; ~10 kyr and (ii) the dating of geologic archives. The latter has permitted the development of the astronomical time scale, widely used today to reconstruct highly accurate geological dates and chronologies. The tasks of computing vs. applying astronomical solutions are usually performed by investigators from different backgrounds, which has led to confusion and recent inaccurate results on the side of the applications. Here we review astronomical solutions and Milankovic forcing in the Earth sciences, primarily aiming at clarifying the astronomical basis, applicability, and limitations of the solutions. We provide a summary of current up-to-date and outdated astronomical solutions and their valid time span. We discuss the fundamental limits imposed by dynamical solar system chaos on astronomical calculations and geological/astrochronological applications. We illustrate basic features of chaotic behavior using a simple mechanical system, i.e., the driven pendulum. Regarding so-called astronomical "metronomes", we point out that the current evidence does not support the notion of generally stable and prominent metronomes for universal use in astrochronology and cyclostratigraphy. We also describe amplitude and frequency modulation of astronomical forcing signals and the relation to their expression in cyclostratigraphic sequences. Furthermore, the various quantities and terminology associated with Earth's axial precession are discussed in detail. Finally, we provide some suggestions regarding practical considerations.</description>

      <title>Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). XIV. Finding terrestrial protoplanets in the galactic neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\sim$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions $&lt;$6 $\mu$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.</description>

      <title>RECOVAR: Representation Covariances on Deep Latent Spaces for Seismic Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While modern deep learning methods have shown great promise in the problem of earthquake detection, the most successful methods so far have been based on supervised learning, which requires large datasets with ground-truth labels. The curation of such datasets is both time consuming and prone to systematic biases, which result in difficulties with cross-dataset generalization, hindering general applicability. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised method for earthquake detection that learns to detect earthquakes from raw waveforms, without access to ground truth labels. The performance is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, the method has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization} performance. The algorithm utilizes deep autoencoders that learn to reproduce the waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck and uses a simple, cross-covariance-based triggering algorithm at the bottleneck for labeling. The approach has the potential to be useful for time series datasets from other domains.</description>
