      <title>Detecting the finer structure of the P vs NP problem with statistical mechanics: the case of the Wang tiling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Spread/Error relationship and spatial error structure of precipitation ensemble nowcasting: Comparison of STEPS and generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictability of the generative AI-based nowcasting model LDCast (trained on another region) is evaluated over Belgium, together with the pysteps implementation of the nowcasting algorithm STEPS. STEPS and LDCast are slightly underdispersive, but the ensemble spread provides an estimation of the error at almost all scales. Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members. This suggests that the content of STEPS and LDCast ensembles is informative in terms of statistics, but not in terms of dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Chaos in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>
