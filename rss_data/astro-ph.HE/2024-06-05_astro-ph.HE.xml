      <title>Nuclear Data to Quantify Urca Cooling in Accreting Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) can accrete matter onto their surface from the companion star. Transiently accreting neutron stars go through alternating phases of active accretion outbursts and quiescence. X-ray observations during the quiescence phase show a drop in X-ray luminosity with the time in quiescence. This is also inferred as the drop in surface temperature or the cooling of accreting neutron stars in quiescence. Analyzing these cooling curves reveals a great deal of information about the structure and composition of neutron stars. However, model-observation comparisons of such cooling curves are challenging - partly due to observational uncertainties, and partly due to incomplete knowledge of heating mechanisms during accretion outbursts. This situation is further exacerbated by the recent discovery of Urca cooling in the neutron star crust. These are cycles that alternate between electron-capture and beta-decay to produce a large flux of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. These freely stream out of the star and carry energy with them, essentially cooling the neutron star crust without changing the composition. As a result, it is necessary to accurately quantify the strength of Urca cooling to constrain the heat sources in neutron star crusts and facilitate better model-observation comparisons of the cooling curves.</description>

      <title>Bondi Flow from Various Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of the stationary integral solutions of steady state transonic accretion flow in spherical symmetry helps to understand accretion phenomena on various astrophysical objects. In recent years, attempts have been made to study accreting black hole systems as an example of autonomous dynamical systems. The fixed point analysis is used to study the transonic properties of accretion flow onto an astrophysical black hole, hence the nature of the phase orbits for the transonic flow solutions can be understood without constructing the integral solutions. Since a large-scale astrophysical fluid flow is vulnerable to external perturbation, one needs to ensure that the stationary accretion solutions are stable under perturbation. By adopting a time-dependent stability analysis scheme for the accretion flow, one demonstrates under which condition the perturbation will not diverge. It has also been observed that a space-time metric, dubbed the sonic metric, can be constructed to describe the propagation of the perturbation embedded within the accreting fluid, which mimics a black hole like spacetime within the accreting fluid, where the transonic surfaces can be identified with a black hole like horizons. Such identification is accomplished using the theory of causal structure - by constructing Carter-Penrose diagrams. An accreting black hole system, thus, can be perceived as a classical analogue gravity model naturally found in the universe. Hence, accretion phenomena onto astrophysical black holes can be looked upon from three apparently non-overlapping perspectives - astrophysical processes, theory of dynamical systems, and emergent gravity (alternatively, the analogue gravity) phenomena, respectively. The present article illustrates, by taking the simplest possible accretion flow model, how one can study astrophysical accretion processes from the aforementioned perspectives (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions and tidal disruption events prefer similar host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past five years, six quasi-periodic X-ray eruption (QPE) sources have been discovered in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. Their origin remains an open question. We present MUSE integral field spectroscopy of five QPE host galaxies to characterize their properties. We find that 3/5 galaxies host extended emission line regions (EELRs) up to 10 kpc in size. The EELRs are photo-ionized by a non-stellar continuum, but the current nuclear luminosity is insufficient to power the observed emission lines. The EELRs are decoupled from the stars both kinematically and in projected sky position, and the low velocities and velocity dispersions ($&lt;$ 100 km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 75$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively) are inconsistent with being AGN- or shock-driven. The origin of the EELRs is likely a previous phase of nuclear activity. The QPE host galaxy properties are strikingly similar to those of tidal disruption events (Wevers et al. submitted). The preference for a very short-lived (the typical EELR lifetime is $\sim$15000 years), gas-rich phase where the nucleus has recently faded significantly suggests that TDEs and QPEs may share a common formation channel, disfavoring AGN accretion disk instabilities as the origin of QPEs. In the assumption that QPEs are related to extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs; stellar-mass objects on bound orbits about massive black holes), the high incidence of EELRs and recently faded nuclear activity can be used to aid in the localization of the host galaxies of EMRIs discovered by low frequency gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Light Travel Time Effects in Blazar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a model for light travel time effects for emission from a plasma blob in a blazar jet. This calculation could be incorporated into more complex models with particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms, but as presented here it is a agnostic as to these mechanisms. This model includes light travel time effects for an expanding or contracting blob. As an example, this model is applied to a flare observed by VERITAS and MAGIC from Mrk 421 in 2013; and to a flare observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope from 3C 454.3 in 2010.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Emission from Jets and Magnetically Arrested Disks in Nearby Radio Galaxies: Application to M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei that drive relativistic jets from their center and are observed in radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. The emission mechanisms and regions are still unknown. High-energy gamma rays can be explained by the emission from the magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around the central supermassive black hole, for which the magnetic flux threading the black hole is in a saturation level, although the emission from the MADs does not explain the optical and X-ray data. We construct a multi-wavelength emission model in which the optical and X-ray emission is emitted by jets and the gamma rays by MADs. Our model takes into account the particle injection by the magnetic reconnection at the jet base close to the black hole and particle entrainment from the ambient gas at the jet emission zone. We apply our model to M87 and find that our model can explain the simultaneous multi-wavelength data. In our model, the emission from the jets is the synchrotron radiation of the nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection, and the emission from the MADs is the synchrotron radiation mainly of the nonthermal protons accelerated by turbulence. We also find that the strong plasma entrainment is necessary to explain the multi-wavelength data. Our model will be tested by variability analysis among the multi-wavelength data.</description>

      <title>Red eminence: The intermediate-luminosity red transient AT 2022fnm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a five-month-long observing campaign of the unusual transient AT 2022fnm, which displays properties common to both luminous red novae (LRNe) and intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs). Although its photometric evolution is broadly consistent with that of LRNe, no second peak is apparent in its light curve, and its spectral properties are more reminiscent of ILRTs. It has a fairly rapid rise time of 5.3$\pm$1.5 d, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of $-12.7\pm$0.1 (in the ATLAS $o$ band). We find some evidence for circumstellar interaction, and a near-infrared excess becomes apparent at approximately +100 d after discovery. We attribute this to a dust echo. Finally, from an analytical diffusion toy model, we attempted to reproduce the pseudo-bolometric light curve and find that a mass of $\sim$4 M$_\odot$ is needed. Overall, the characteristics of AT 2022fnm are consistent with a weak stellar eruption or an explosion reminiscent of low-energy type IIP supernovae, which is compatible with expectations for ILRTs.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of electron-positron induced streaming instability in the context of gamma-ray halos around pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of slow diffusion regions as the origin for extended TeV emission halos around some pulsars (such as PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14) challenges the standard scaling of the electron diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium. Self-generated turbulence by electron-positron pairs streaming out of the pulsar wind nebula was proposed as a possible mechanism to produce the enhanced turbulence required to explain the morphology and brightness of these TeV halos. We perform fully kinetic 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations of this instability, considering the case where streaming electrons and positrons have the same density. This implies purely resonant instability as the beam does not carry any current. We compare the linear phase of the instability with analytical theory and find very reasonable agreement. The non-linear phase of the instability is also studied, which reveals that the intensity of saturated waves is consistent with a momentum exchange criterion between a decelerating beam and growing magnetic waves. With the adopted parameters, the instability-driven wavemodes cover both the Alfv\'enic (fluid) and kinetic scales. The spectrum of the produced waves is non-symmetric, with left-handed circular polarisation waves being strongly damped when entering the ion-cyclotron branch, while right-handed waves are suppressed at smaller wavelength when entering the Whistler branch. The low-wavenumber part of the spectrum remains symmetric when in the Alfv\'enic branch. As a result, positrons behave dynamically differently compared to electrons. We also observed a second harmonic plasma emission in the wave spectrum. An MHD-PIC approach is warranted to probe hotter beams and investigate the Alfv\'en branch physics. This work confirms that the self-confinement scenario develops essentially according to analytical expectations [...](abridged)</description>

      <title>Dark magnetohydrodynamics: Black hole accretion in superradiant dark photon clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes threaded by massive vector fields can be subject to a superradiant instability, growing a cloud of massive vector particles around it. In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.</description>

      <title>Spying on the quickly variable optical sky with the fast optical photometer SiFAP2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of detectors with a high time resolution has been pivotal to our comprehension of neutron stars and the accurate measurement of their properties. While high-time resolution astronomy has become a standard in the radio and the high-/very-high-energy bands, progress in the visible band has been comparatively much slower. SiFAP2 is a high-speed optical photometer mounted at the INAF Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Its potential emerged with the discovery of the first two optical millisecond pulsars: these are among the most efficient particle accelerators and natural laboratories of fundamental physics. Optical millisecond pulsations challenge the standard pulsar paradigm, requiring innovative solutions. Higher photon counting statistics of optical telescopes, compared to high-energy instruments, attain unprecedented sensitivity for weak pulsed signals from bright accreting neutron stars, which are the best candidates for still undetected continuous gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Very-long-baseline interferometry study of the flaring blazar TXS 1508+572 in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift blazars provide valuable input to studies of the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and provide constraints on cosmological models. Detections at high energies ($0.1&lt;\mathrm{E}&lt;100$ GeV) of these distant sources are rare, but when they exhibit bright gamma-ray flares, we are able to study them. However, contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations of high-redshift objects ($z&gt;4$) during their different periods of activity have not been carried out so far. An excellent opportunity for such a study arose when the blazar TXS 1508+572 ($z=4.31$) exhibited a $\gamma$-ray flare in 2022 February in the $0.1-300$ GeV range with a flux 25 times brighter than the one reported in the in the fourth catalog of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. Our goal is to monitor the morphological changes, spectral index and opacity variations that could be associated with the preceding $\gamma$-ray flare in TXS 1508+572 to find the origin of the high-energy emission in this source. We also plan to compare the source characteristics in the radio band to the blazars in the local Universe ($z&lt;0.1$). In addition, we aim to collect quasi-simultaneous data to our multi-wavelength observations of the object, making TXS 1508+572 the first blazar in the early Universe ($z&gt;4$) with contemporaneous multi-frequency data available in its high state. In order to study the parsec-scale structure of the source, we performed three epochs of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) follow-up observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) supplemented with the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, which corresponds to 80, 117, and 228 GHz in the rest frame of TXS 1508+572. In addition, one 86 GHz (456 GHz) measurement was performed by the VLBA and the Green Bank Telescope during the first epoch.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis toward the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1846.9-0227 -- Jets of a proto-planetary nebula producing gamma-rays?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the gamma-ray sources in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog are associated with pulsars and blazars. However, unveiling the nature of the still unassociated gamma-ray sources is important for the understanding of high energy emission mechanisms in astrophysical objects. This work presents a comprehensive study toward the region covered by the Fermi source 4FGL J1846.9$-$0227 previously suggested to be a blazar or a massive protostar. Using multiwavelength observations, we analyzed several astrophysical objects in the region as possible counterparts of the Fermi-LAT source. Having discarded most of them after a comprehensive analysis, we suggest that the most likely candidate to be such a counterpart is IRAS 18443$-$0231. We discovered that this source, previously cataloged as a planetary nebula candidate, actually is a proto-planetary nebula. The radio continuum image at 3 GHz associated with such a nebula allowed us to identify a jet-like structure. Additionally, we identified an associated red-shifted CO molecular outflow and a dense molecular clump in which the source is embedded. We obtained a radio spectral index of $-0.47 \pm 0.08$ for the source, indicating syncrothron emission due to accelerated particles. Thus, we suggest that processes such as proton-proton collisions and relativistic Bremsstrahlung are likely to occur. IRAS 18443$-$0231, lying almost at the center of the Fermi confidence ellipse and related to the hard X-ray source 4XMM J184700.4$-$022752, would be the first association between a proto-planeatry nebula and gamma emission.</description>

      <title>The Heavier the Faster: A Sub-population of Heavy, Rapidly Spinning and Quickly Evolving Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spins of binary black holes (BBHs) measured from gravitational waves carry notable information of the formation pathways. Here we propose a quantity "dimensionless net spin" ($\chi_{\rm N}$), which is related to the sum of angular momentum of component black holes in the system, to provide a novel perspective to study the origin(s) of BBHs. By performing hierarchical Bayesian inference on $\chi_{\rm N}$, we find strong evidence that the marginal distribution of this quantity can be better fitted by two Gaussian components rather than one: there is a narrow peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.15$ and another extended peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.47$. We also find that the rapidly spinning systems likely dominate the high-mass end of the population and they evolve with redshift much quicker. These findings bring new challenges to the field binary scenario, and suggest that dynamical process should plays a key role in forming high total mass BBHs.</description>

      <title>Detection of extended gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of Cl Danks 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission towards the G305 star-forming region. Using almost 15 years of observation data from {\sl Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we detected an extended gamma-ray source in this region with a significance of $\sim 13 \sigma$. The gamma-ray radiation reveals a clear pion-bump feature and can be fitted with the power law parent proton spectrum with an index of $-2.5$. The total cosmic ray (CR) proton energy in the gamma-ray production region is estimated to be the order of $10^{49}\ \rm erg$. We further derived the CR radial distribution from both the gamma-ray emission and gas distribution and found it roughly obeys the $1/r$ type profile, which is consistent with other similar systems and expected from the continuous injection of CRs by the central powerful young massive star cluster Danks 1 or Danks 2 in this region. Together with former detections of similar gamma-ray structures, such as Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and W40, the detection supports the hypothesis that young massive star clusters are CR accelerators.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Mass and Radius Measurements of Neutron Stars with Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos and explain how to interpret mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation if these dark halos exist.</description>

      <title>Progenitor with small reaction networks should not be used as initial conditions for core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core collapse initial conditions are a bottleneck in understanding the explosion mechanism(s) of massive stars. Stellar evolution codes struggle after carbon burning, and either stop or adopt numerical simplifications missing crucial physics. The use of small nuclear reaction networks (NRN) that account for energy production but bypass weak reactions is typical, but insufficient to study the dynamics of the collapse. We advise against the use of progenitors computed with small NRN in expensive multi-dimensional simulations of core collapse, bounce, (jet formation), and explosion.</description>

      <title>First VLBI detection of Fornax A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio galaxies harbouring jetted active galactic nuclei are a frequent target of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) because they play an essential role in exploring how jets form and propagate. Hence, only few have not been detected with VLBI yet; Fornax A is one of the most famous examples. Here we present the first detection of the compact core region of Fornax A with VLBI. At 8.4 GHz the faint core is consistent with an unresolved point source. We constrained its flux density to be $S_0 = 47.5-62.3\,\textrm{mJy}$ and its diameter to be $D^\textrm{min}_0 \leq 70\,\mu\textrm{as}$. The high values of the measured brightness temperature ($T_\textrm{B} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\textrm{K}$) imply that the observed radiation is of non-thermal origin, likely associated with the synchrotron emission from the active galactic nucleus. We also investigated the possibility of a second radio source being present within the field of view. Adding a second Gaussian component to the geometrical model-fit does not significantly improve the quality of the fit and we, therefore, conclude that our detection corresponds to the compact core of Fornax A. Analysis of the non-trivial closure phases provides evidence for the detection of more extended flux density, on the angular scale of $\sim4000\,\mu\textrm{as}$. Finally, the fractional circular polarisation of the core is consistent with zero, with a conservative upper limit being $m_\textrm{circ} \leq 4\%$.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. This fact highlights the necessity for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the standard $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that the AGN feedback plays a crucial role in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extended emission line regions in post-starburst galaxies hosting tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an extended emission line region (EELR) in MUSE observations of Markarian 950, a nearby ($z=0.01628$) post-starburst (PSB) galaxy that hosted the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF-16fnl. The EELR requires a non-stellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity L$_{\rm ion, min} \gtrsim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inconsistent with the current weak state (L$_{\rm IR,AGN} &lt; 2.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity ($\sim$-50 km s$^{-1}$) and low turbulence ($\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics are not AGN driven. Markarian 950 is the third post-starburst galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of $\sim 10 \times$ higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich post-merger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE-powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.</description>

      <title>Using CSST and ejecta-wind interaction in type II-P supernovae to constrain the wind-mass loss of red supergiant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of H-rich, type II-plateau supernova (SN II-P) progenitors remain uncertain, and this is primarily due to the complexities associated with red supergiant (RSG) wind-mass loss. Recent studies have suggested that the interaction of the ejecta with a standard RSG wind should produce unambiguous signatures in the optical (e.g., a broad, boxy H${\alpha}$ profile) and in the UV (especially Ly ${\alpha}$ and Mg ii ${\lambda}{\lambda}$ 2795, 2802) a few years following the explosion. Such features are expected to be generic in all SNe II-P and can be utilized to constrain RSG winds. Here, we investigate the possibility of detecting late-time (0.3-10 years since explosion) SNe II-P in the NUV with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Convolving the existing model spectra of ejecta-wind interactions in SNe II-P with the transmission functions of the CSST, we calculated the associated multiband light curves, in particular, the NUV (255 nm${\sim}$317 nm) band, as well as the $NUV-r$ color. We find that the CSST will be able to detect the NUV radiation associated with ejecta-wind interaction for hundreds SNe II-P out to a few hundred Mpc over its ten-year main sky survey. The CSST will therefore provide a sizable sample of SNe II-P with the NUV signatures of ejecta-wind interaction. This will be helpful for understanding the mass loss history of SN II-P progenitors and their origins.</description>

      <title>Radial X-ray profiles of simulated galaxies: Contributions from hot gas and XRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models of structure formation predict the presence of a hot gaseous atmosphere around galaxies. While this hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) has been observationally confirmed through UV absorption lines, the detection of its direct X-ray emission remains scarce. We investigate theoretical predictions of the intrinsic CGM X-ray surface brightness (SB) using simulated galaxies and connect them to their global properties such as gas temperature, hot gas fraction and stellar mass. We select a sample of galaxies from the ultra-high resolution ($48\ \rm{cMpc\, h^{-1}}$) cosmological volume of the Magneticum Pathfinder set of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We classify them as star-forming (SF) or quiescent (QU) based on their specific star-formation rate. For each galaxy we generate X-ray mock data using the X-ray photon simulator PHOX, from which we obtain SB profiles out to the virial radius for different X-ray emitting components, namely gas, active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries (XRBs). We fit a $\beta$-profile to each galaxy and observe trends between its slope and global quantities of the simulated galaxy. We find marginal differences between the average total SB profile of the CGM in SF and QU galaxies, with the contribution from hot gas being the largest ($&gt;50\%$) at radii $r&gt;0.05\,R_{\rm{vir}}$. The contribution from X-ray binaries (XRBs) equals the gas contribution for small radii and is non-zero for large radii. The galaxy population shows positive correlations between global properties and normalization of the SB profile. The slope of fitted $\beta$-profiles correlates strongly with the total gas luminosity, which in turn shows strong connections to the current accretion rate of the central super-massive black hole (SMBH).</description>

      <title>No Significant Redshift Evolution in the Intrinsic Scatter of the $M_\bullet$-$M_\star$ Relation for Overmassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the local Universe, the ratio between the mass of a central black hole and the stellar mass of its host galaxy is $\sim 0.1 \%$. Recently, JWST discovered numerous galaxies at $z&gt;4$ that seem to deviate from the local relation, with black holes overmassive by $10-100$ times. Similar galaxies were also discovered at cosmic noon. The intrinsic scatter in the relation describes how much the evolutionary histories of the single galaxies deviate from the mean evolutionary pattern of their parent dataset. This Research Note examines whether a cosmic evolution of the intrinsic scatter can be detected by assessing its value for datasets in various redshift ranges. Using data from the local Universe ($z &lt; 0.055$), low ($ 0.4 \leq z \leq 0.9$), intermediate ($ 0.9 \leq z \leq 4$), and high ($z &gt; 4$) redshift, we conclude that there is no statistically significant redshift evolution of the intrinsic scatter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Frontier: White Dwarf-Based Constraints on Light Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of our galaxy, white dwarfs (WDs) are natural sentinels, capturing the enigmatic dark matter (DM) particles that incessantly traverse their interiors. These celestial bodies provide a unique vantage point for probing interactions between DM particles and their constituents-nuclei or electrons-should such interactions exist. The captured DM particles may accumulate, undergo mutual annihilation, or be evaporated by the WD's own nuclei or electrons, thereby perturbing the standard cooling sequence predicted by stellar evolution theory. This letter reports pioneering constraints on DM-electron interactions derived from an in-depth analysis of four pulsating WDs. By leveraging the period variation rates of their pulsation modes, we delineate the following constraints: for a form factor $F(q) = 1$, in the DM mass range $20 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 80 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a cross-section limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-56} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$; for a form factor $F(q) = (\alpha m_{e})^{2}/q^{2}$, in a the DM mass range $20\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 70 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-52} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. These newly established constraints surpass current direct detection experiments by over fifteen orders of magnitude, forging a path into the uncharted territories of the DM parameter space. This work not only advances our understanding of light dark matter-electron interactions but also exemplifies the potential of WDs as important astrophysical laboratories for probing the elusive nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Strange Dwarfs: a review on the (in)stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.</description>

      <title>The Amaterasu particle: constraining the superheavy dark matter origin of UHECRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amaterasu, the second most energetic ($244$ EeV) cosmic ray particle has been recently detected by the Telescope Array (TA) surface detector. The origin of the TA Amaterasu event is puzzling, as its arrival direction points back to a void in the local Universe, lacking conventional astrophysical ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic ray (CR) sources. Hence, we explore the possibility if this TA Amaterasu event could have originated from the decay of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) in the Milky Way. Such an origin also opens up multi-messenger detection channels in both UHE gamma-rays and UHE neutrinos. In this present work, using the TA Amaterasu event and the multi-messenger limits/sensitivities from various UHE telescopes, we place stringent constraints on the lifetime and mass of the SHDM. We find that the non-detection of the corresponding gamma-rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the TA is in severe tension with the SHDM parameter space required to explain the TA Amaterasu event. Additionally, we extend the multi-messenger analysis to the future UHE gamma-ray and UHE neutrino telescopes such as PAO upgrade, GRAND 200k and IceCube-Gen2. We find that the bounds from the future neutrino telescopes will be able to compete with the present UHECR bounds. However, compared to the existing UHE gamma-ray bounds, the future PAO upgrade and the GRAND 200k gamma-ray detectors will improve the bounds on SHDM lifetime by at least one order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Hyperluminous optical-ultraviolet fares have been detected in gamma-ray bursts and the luminosity record was held by naked-eye event GRB 080319B. Such fares are widely attributed to internal shock or external reverse shock radiation. Here, with a new method developed to derive reliable photometry from saturated sources of Swift/UVOT, we carry out time-resolved analysis of the initial white-band 150s exposure of GRB 220101A, a burst at a redshift of 4.618, and report a rapidly evolving optical-ultraviolet fare with a high absolute AB magnitude of -39.4$\pm$0.2. In contrast to GRB 080319B, the temporal behaviour of this new fare does not trace the gamma-ray activity. Instead of either internal shocks or reverse shock, this extremely energetic optical-ultraviolet fare is most likely to originate from the refreshed shocks induced by the late-ejected extremely energetic material catching up with the earlier-launched decelerating outflow. This finding reveals the diverse origins of the extremely energetic optical-ultraviolet fares and demonstrates the necessity of high-time-resolution observations at early times.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the structure and dynamics of the plasma atmospheres and Coulomb-liquid oceans on neutron stars. Salient dynamical parameters are identified and their values estimated for the governing set of magnetohydrodynamics equations. Neutron star atmospheres and oceans are strongly stratified and, depending on the rotation period, contain a multitude of long-lived vortices (spots) and/or narrow zonal jets (free-shear zones) in the large plasma-beta regime - i.e., $\beta_p \gg 1$ (hydrodynamic regime). In contrast, when $\beta_p \lesssim 1$ (magnetohydrodynamic regime), the flow is dominated by a global lattice of effectively fixed magnetic islands (plasmoids) - without any jets. Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of dynamic atmospheres and oceans on neutron stars is crucial for interpreting observations of their X-ray emissions.</description>

Abstract: The cores of massive neutron stars offer a unique environment for the nuclear matter at intermediate density in the universe. The global characteristics of a neutron star, as well as the gravitational waves emitted from the mergers of two neutron stars, offer valuable insights into dense nuclear matter. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the potential hadron-quark transition on the properties of neutron stars and the signals of the gravitational waves stemming from the merger of binary neutron stars, including waveforms, frequency evolutions as well as the spectrum curves, utilizing the equations of state constructed from the Maxwell ansatz, Gibbs ansatz and, the crossover scenario. We explicitly construct the equations of state in such a way that they converge at low and high densities therefore the differences are only from the scenarios of the transitions and the locations -- or the parameters in the equation of state. Using such constructed equations of state, we simulate the signals of the GW and analyze their differences due to locations of the transition, the scenarios of the transition, and the masses of the component stars. By combining our findings with the expected detection of gravitational waves around $(2-4)$ kHz from binary neutron star mergers and their associated electromagnetic signals, we expect to uncover some key characteristics of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Isolated pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference</title>

Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magnetorotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron star birth properties and their dynamical and magnetorotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from lognormal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic field decay with a power law. Each lognormal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and we produce a large database of synthetic $P$--$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magnetorotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the lognormal distributions and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at the $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step toward robust statistical inference for complex population synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multiwavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularities and black holes from transmutation of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the western Pictor A hotspot in the hard X-rays with NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of X-ray emission from the resolved kiloparsec-scale jets and hotspots of many active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain, particularly where the X-ray emission is separate from the radio-optical synchrotron component. Possible explanations include synchrotron emission from a second electron population and external Compton or synchrotron self-Compton processes -- alternatives which imply very different physical conditions within the jet. Until recently, X-ray studies of resolved jets and hotspots have been restricted to below ~10 keV, often showing a hard spectral index indicating a spectral peak beyond this energy range. Here we present NuSTAR observations of the nearby powerful radio galaxy Pictor A, in which we clearly detect the western hotspot at approximately 4' from the host galaxy, the most significant detection of hotspot emission above 10 keV to date. The NuSTAR spectrum is best fit by a single powerlaw of index $\Gamma$ = 2.03 $\pm$ 0.04; an exponential cut-off gives a 1$\sigma$ lower limit on the cutoff energy of 40.7 keV. We confirm previous findings of variations in the soft X-ray flux detected by Chandra over the 2000 to 2015 period, at a significance of 6.5$\sigma$. This rises to &gt;8$\sigma$ in the common 3-8 keV band using the combined 22-year span of Chandra and NuSTAR observations. The variability of the western Pictor A hotspot strongly confirms the previously argued synchrotron nature of the X-ray emission for the hotspot, while the lower bound to the spectral cutoff energy implies electron energies in the hotspot reach up to at least a few TeV.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Debris Disk Creation in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817/AT2017gfo inaugurated an era of multimessenger astrophysics, in which gravitational wave and multiwavelength photon observations complement one another to provide unique insight on astrophysical systems. A broad theoretical consensus exists in which the photon phenomenology of neutron star mergers largely rests upon the evolution of the small amount of matter left on bound orbits around the black hole or massive neutron star remaining after the merger. Because this accretion disk is far from inflow equilibrium, its subsequent evolution depends very strongly on its initial state, yet very little is known about how this state is determined. Using both snapshot and tracer particle data from a numerical relativity/MHD simulation of an equal-mass neutron star merger that collapses to a black hole, we show how gravitational forces arising in a non-axisymmetric, dynamical spacetime supplement hydrodynamical effects in shaping the initial structure of the bound debris disk. The work done by hydrodynamical forces is ${\sim}10$ times greater than that due to time-dependent gravity. Although gravitational torques prior to remnant relaxation are an order of magnitude larger than hydrodynamical torques, their intrinsic sign symmetry leads to strong cancellation; as a result, hydrodynamical and gravitational torques have comparable effect. We also show that the debris disk's initial specific angular momentum distribution is sharply peaked at roughly the specific angular momentum of the merged neutron star's outer layers, a few $r_g c$, and identify the regulating mechanism.</description>

      <title>A correlation between unabsorbed hard X-rays and neutrinos in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN</title>

Abstract: The first astrophysical high-energy neutrino source candidate identified by IceCube at a significance level of $&gt;3\sigma$ was the blazar TXS 0506+056, an active galactic nuclei (AGN) with an accreting supermassive black hole that drives a relativistic jet directed towards Earth. Recently, IceCube discovered strong evidence that Seyfert galaxies also emit neutrinos, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the neutrino-unabsorbed hard X-ray luminosity ratio of the blazar TXS 0506+056 is consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near the central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino-hard X-ray flux ratios were found for three of IceCube-detected Seyfert galaxies, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet.</description>

      <title>Ten Supernova-rise in Binary Driven Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with a supernova (SN) coincides remarkably with the energy output from a binary system comprising a very massive carbon-oxygen (CO) core and an associated binary neutron star (NS) by the Binary-Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model. The dragging effect in the late evolution of such systems leads to co-rotation, with binary periods on the order of minutes, resulting in a very fast rotating core and a binary NS companion at a distance of $\sim 10^5$ km. Such a fast-rotating CO core, stripped of its hydrogen and helium, undergoes gravitational collapse and, within a fraction of seconds, leads to a supernova (SN) and a newly born, fast-spinning neutron star ($\nu$NS), we name the emergence of the SN and the $\nu$NS as the SN-rise and $\nu$NS-rise. Typically, the SN energies range from $10^{51}$ to $10^{53}$ erg. We address this issue by examining 10 cases of Type-I BdHNe, the most energetic ones, in which SN accretion onto the companion NS leads to the formation of a black hole (BH). In all ten cases, the energetics of the SN events are estimated, ranging between $0.18$ and $12 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Additionally, in all 8 sources at redshift $z$ closer than $4.61$, a clear thermal blackbody component has been identified, with temperatures between $6.2$ and $39.99$ keV, as a possible signature of pair-driven SN. The triggering of the X-ray afterglow induced by the $\nu$NS-rise are identified in three cases at high redshift where early X-ray observations are achievable, benefits from the interplay of cosmological effects.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent interferometric observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the horizon-scale emission from sources in the vicinity of nearby supermassive black holes. Future space-based interferometers promise to measure the "photon ring"--a narrow, ring-shaped, lensed feature predicted by general relativity, but not yet observed--and thereby open a new window into strong gravity. Here we present AART: an Adaptive Analytical Ray-Tracing code that exploits the integrability of light propagation in the Kerr spacetime to rapidly compute high-resolution simulated black hole images, together with the corresponding radio visibility accessible on very long space-ground baselines. The code samples images on a nonuniform adaptive grid that is specially tailored to the lensing behavior of the Kerr geometry and is therefore particularly well-suited to studying photon rings. This numerical approach guarantees that interferometric signatures are correctly computed on long baselines, and the modularity of the code allows for detailed studies of equatorial sources with complex emission profiles and time variability. To demonstrate its capabilities, we use AART to simulate a black hole movie of a stochastic, non-stationary, non-axisymmetric equatorial source; by time-averaging the visibility amplitude of each snapshot, we are able to extract the projected diameter of the photon ring and recover the shape predicted by general relativity.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the early universe's equation of state and primordial black hole production with PTA, BBN, and CMB observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

Abstract: Existing Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) operate by detecting either the electrons or holes created in an ionization event. We propose a new type of imager, the Dual-Sided CCD, which collects and measures both charge carriers on opposite sides of the device via a novel dual-buried channel architecture. We show that this dual detection strategy provides exceptional dark-count rejection and enhanced timing capabilities. These advancements have wide-ranging implications for dark-matter searches, near-IR/optical spectroscopy, and time-domain X-ray astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Probing hadron-quark phase transition in twin stars using $f$-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is conjectured that a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in the ultrahigh-density environment of Neutron Stars (NS), the nature of phase transition remains an unresolved mystery. Furthermore, recent efforts reveal that the finite surface tension effects can lead to a mixed phase with different geometric shapes (so-called "pasta" phases), leading to a smooth phase transition from hadronic to quark matter in the NS interior. Depending on whether there is a strong or a pasta-induced smooth first-order phase transition, one may expect a third family of stable, compact stars or "twin stars" to appear, with the same mass but different radii compared to NSs. The possibility of identifying twin stars using astrophysical observations has been a subject of interest. This study investigates the potential of probing the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition through future gravitational wave (GW) detections from fundamental ($f$-) mode oscillations in Neutron Stars. Using a newly developed model that parametrizes the hadron-quark phase transition with ``pasta phases," we calculate $f$-mode characteristics within a full general relativistic framework. We then use Universal Relations in GW asteroseismology to derive stellar properties from the detected mode parameters. Our findings suggest that detecting GWs from $f$-modes with third-generation GW detectors offers a promising scenario for the existence of twin stars. However, we also estimate various uncertainties in determining the mode parameters and conclude that these uncertainties make it more challenging to identify the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of the parameter space of axion and axion-like particle dark matter is a major aim of the future program of astroparticle physics investigations. In this context, we present a possible strategy that focuses on detecting radio emissions arising from the conversion of dark matter axions in the Sun's magnetic field, including conversion in sunspots. We demonstrate that near-future low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the SKA Low, may access regions of unexplored parameter space for masses $m_a\lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>
