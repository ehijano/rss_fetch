      <title>A Bio-Inspired Leader-based Energy Management System for Drone Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones are embedded systems (ES) used across a wide range of fields, from photography to shipments and even during crisis management for searching, rescuing and damage assessment activities. However, their limited battery life and high energy consumption are very important challenges, especially in networked systems where multiple drones must communicate with a Ground Base Station (GBS). This study addresses these limitations by proposing the implementation of a bio-inspired leader-based energy management system for drone fleets. Inspired by bio-behavioral models, the algorithm dynamically chooses a single drone as a Leader in a cluster to handle long-range communication with the GBS, allowing other drones to preserve their energy. The effectiveness of the proposed bio-inspired algorithm is evaluated by varying network sizes and configurations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly increases network efficiency and service time by removing useless energy consumption communications.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of RU Allocation and C-SR in Multi-AP Coordinated Wi-Fi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem for joint RU allocation and C-SR to maximize the throughput of a multi-AP coordinated WiFi system. The optimization problem is found to be a non-linear integer programming problem. We solve the problem for several network scenarios using an optimization tool. The joint design significantly improves throughput compared to a non-coordinated system. To reduce computational complexity, we also provide a heuristic solution to the problem. The proposed heuristic achieves throughput comparable to that of the computationally expensive optimization tool based solution approach.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Charging Optimization for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks via Heterogeneous Mobile Chargers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things applications driving widespread wireless sensor network (WSN) deployment, traditional WSNs remain fundamentally constrained by persistent energy limitations that severely restrict network lifetime and operational sustainability. Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) integrated with wireless power transfer (WPT) technology emerge as a transformative paradigm, theoretically enabling unlimited operational lifetime. In this paper, we investigate a heterogeneous mobile charging architecture that strategically combines automated aerial vehicles (AAVs) and ground smart vehicles (SVs) in complex terrain scenarios to collaboratively exploit the superior mobility of AAVs and extended endurance of SVs for optimal energy distribution. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses the dynamic balance of heterogeneous charger advantages, charging efficiency versus mobility energy consumption trade-offs, and real-time adaptive coordination under time-varying network conditions. This problem presents significant computational challenges due to its high-dimensional continuous action space, non-convex optimization landscape, and dynamic environmental constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the improved heterogeneous agent trust region policy optimization (IHATRPO) algorithm that integrates a self-attention mechanism for enhanced complex environmental state processing and employs a Beta sampling strategy to achieve unbiased gradient computation in continuous action spaces. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that IHATRPO achieves a 39% performance improvement over the original HATRPO, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline algorithms while substantially increasing sensor node survival rate and charging system efficiency.</description>

      <title>CareNet: Linking Home-router Network Traffic to DSM-5 Depressive Behavior Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital mental-health sensing increasingly depends on mobile or wearable devices that require intrusive permissions and continuous user compliance. We present CareNet, a router-centric system that transforms household network metadata into interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with DSM-5 depressive-symptom domains. All processing occurs locally at the home gateway, preserving privacy while maintaining visibility of temporal routines.
  The core contribution is the Fuzzy Additive Symptom Likelihood (FASL), a transparent formulation that fuses header-level metrics into daily criterion-level likelihoods using bounded fuzzy memberships and additive aggregation. Combined with a DSM-style temporal gate, FASL integrates short-term traffic fluctuations into persistent, clinically interpretable indicators. Evaluation on realistic multi-day traces shows that CareNet captures characteristic patterns such as delayed sleep timing and attentional instability without payload inspection. The results highlight the feasibility of reproducible, explainable behavioral inference from router-side telemetry.</description>

      <title>Distributed Pulse-Wave Simulator for DDoS Dataset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-wave Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks generate short, synchronized bursts of traffic that circumvent pattern-based detection and quickly exhaust traditional defense systems. This transient and spatially distributed behavior makes analysis extremely challenging, as no public datasets capture how such attacks evolve across multiple network domains. Since each domain observes only a partial viewpoint of the attack, a correlated, multi-vantage view is essential for comprehensive analysis, early detection, and attribution.
  This paper presents DPWS, an open-source simulator for generating distributed pulse-wave DDoS datasets. DPWS models multi-AS topologies and produces synchronized packet captures at multiple autonomous systems, showing the distributed structure of coordinated bursts. It enables fine-grained control of traffic parameters through a lightweight YAML interface. DPWS reproduces pulse-wave dynamics across multiple vantage points, exhibits natural fingerprint variability at equal aggregate rates, and scales with MPI in ns-3, providing a reproducible basis for studying pulse-wave behaviour and benchmarking distributed DDoS defenses, while sharing practical insights on ns-3 scalability and synchronization gained during development.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in autonomous formations necessitates accurate and timely communication of safety information. A communication protocol that supports timely and successful transfer of safety information between UAVs is therefore needed. This paper presents Distributed Self-allocated Time slot Reuse (D-STR). Our D-STR protocol addresses the essential task of communicating safety information in rigid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formations with different network topologies, enabling collision-free deployment of the formation. This is an important step for improving the safety and practicality of UAV formations in application scenarios that span a range of industries.</description>

      <title>AIvailable: A Software-Defined Architecture for LLM-as-a-Service on Heterogeneous and Legacy GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLM) has increased the need for scalable, high-performance inference systems, yet most existing frameworks assume homogeneous, resource-rich hardware, often unrealistic in academic, or resource-constrained settings. We introduce AIvailable, a low-cost, highly available LLM-as-a-Service (LLMaaS) platform, that uses a software-defined approach for running LLMs across heterogeneous and legacy GPU nodes, including NVIDIA and AMD devices, with a focus on fully utilizing each node's VRAM. AIvailable operates as a fully GPU-accelerated inference without CPU fallbacks, featuring a unified client interface that allows seamless interaction with all deployed LLMs through a single logical unit. The architecture comprises four main components: the Client Interface for user access, the Service Frontend for secure request routing and load balancing, the SDAI Controller for orchestration, deployment, and monitoring, and the Service Backend of heterogeneous GPU nodes executing workloads. By abstracting GPU-specific details and providing dynamic, VRAM-aware allocation and reallocation of models, AIvailable ensures efficient use of resources and resilience against failures or workload fluctuations. Targeting academic labs, private companies, and other constrained organizations, it supports diverse open LLMs helping democratize generative AI through the repurposing of legacy GPUs.</description>

      <title>LithoSeg: A Coarse-to-Fine Framework for High-Precision Lithography Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and measurement of lithography scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are crucial for ensuring precise process control, optimizing device performance, and advancing semiconductor manufacturing yield. Lithography segmentation requires pixel-level delineation of groove contours and consistent performance across diverse pattern geometries and process window. However, existing methods often lack the necessary precision and robustness, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we propose LithoSeg, a coarse-to-fine network tailored for lithography segmentation. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Human-in-the-Loop Bootstrapping scheme for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to attain robustness with minimal supervision. In the subsequent fine stage, we recast 2D segmentation as 1D regression problem by sampling groove-normal profiles using the coarse mask and performing point-wise refinement with a lightweight MLP. LithoSeg outperforms previous approaches in both segmentation accuracy and metrology precision while requiring less supervision, offering promising prospects for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SenseRay-3D: Generalizable and Physics-Informed Framework for End-to-End Indoor Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling indoor radio propagation is crucial for wireless network planning and optimization. However, existing approaches often rely on labor-intensive manual modeling of geometry and material properties, resulting in limited scalability and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents SenseRay-3D, a generalizable and physics-informed end-to-end framework that predicts three-dimensional (3D) path-loss heatmaps directly from RGB-D scans, thereby eliminating the need for explicit geometry reconstruction or material annotation. The proposed framework builds a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation that jointly encodes occupancy, electromagnetic material characteristics, and transmitter-receiver geometry, which is processed by a SwinUNETR-based neural network to infer environmental path-loss relative to free-space path-loss. A comprehensive synthetic indoor propagation dataset is further developed to validate the framework and to serve as a standardized benchmark for future research. Experimental results show that SenseRay-3D achieves a mean absolute error of 4.27 dB on unseen environments and supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample, demonstrating its scalability, efficiency, and physical consistency. SenseRay-3D paves a new path for sense-driven, generalizable, and physics-consistent modeling of indoor propagation, marking a major leap beyond our pioneering EM DeepRay framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual-Layer Web Application Firewall (ADL-WAF) Leveraging Machine Learning for Enhanced Anomaly and Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web Application Firewalls are crucial for protecting web applications against a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Web Application Firewalls often struggle to effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic, leading to limited efficacy in threat detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Dual-Layer WAF employing a two-layered Machine Learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of anomaly and threat detection. The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets. Evaluation using these datasets shows that ADL WAF achieves a detection accuracy of 99.88% and a precision of 100%, significantly enhancing anomaly detection and reducing false positives. These findings suggest that integrating machine learning techniques into WAFs can substantially improve web application security by providing more accurate and efficient threat detection.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity of High-Altitude Platform Stations: Threat Taxonomy, Attacks and Defenses with Standards Mapping - DDoS Attack Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging stratospheric nodes within non-terrestrial networks. We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance-while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation.</description>

      <title>Indirect Coflow Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider routing in reconfigurable networks, which is also known as coflow scheduling in the literature. The algorithmic literature generally (perhaps implicitly) assumes that the amount of data to be transferred is large. Thus the standard way to model a collection of requested data transfers is by an integer demand matrix $D$, where the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ of $D$ is an integer representing the amount of information that the application wants to send from machine/node $i$ to machine/node $j$. A feasible coflow schedule is then a sequence of matchings, which represent the sequence of data transfers that covers $D$. In this work, we investigate coflow scheduling when the size of some of the requested data transfers may be small relative to the amount of data that can be transferred in one round. fractional matchings and/or that employ indirect routing, and compare the relative utility of these options. We design algorithms that perform much better for small demands than the algorithms in the literature that were designed for large data transfers.</description>

      <title>MM-Telco: Benchmarks and Multimodal Large Language Models for Telecom Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. In telecommunications, they hold the potential to transform network optimization, automate troubleshooting, enhance customer support, and ensure regulatory compliance. However, their deployment in telecom is hindered by domain-specific challenges that demand specialized adaptation. To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain. The benchmark introduces various tasks (both text based and image based) that address various practical real-life use cases such as network operations, network management, improving documentation quality, and retrieval of relevant text and images. Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance. Our experiments also help analyze the weak areas in the working of current state-of-art multimodal LLMs, thus guiding towards further development and research.</description>

      <title>A Secure Semantic Communication System Based on Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to ensure the security of textual data transmission in a semantic communication system. In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-Based Near-Optimal MIMO Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is essential for the optimal functioning of next-generation wireless networks; however, enhancing its signal-detection performance for improved spectral efficiency is challenging. Here, we propose an approach that transforms the discrete MIMO detection problem into a continuous problem while leveraging the efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. For this continuous framework, we employ a mixture of t-distributions as the prior distribution. To improve the performance in the coded case further, we treat the likelihood's temperature parameter as a random variable and address its optimization. This treatment leads to the adoption of a horseshoe density for the likelihood. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal detection performance while maintaining polynomial computational complexity. This MIMO detection technique can accelerate the development of 6G mobile communication systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is expected to be a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous services and enhancing the system resilience. However, the high-altitude operation and inherent mobility of NTN introduce significant challenges across the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. Apart from that, how to achieve artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities in NTN for intelligent network management and orchestration remains an important challenge. To solve the challenges above, we propose integrating the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) with NTN as a promising solution, leveraging its principles of disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive technical literature on ORAN and NTN, respectively, there is a lack of a holistic view of the integration of ORAN and NTN architectures, particularly in terms of how intelligent ORAN can address the scalability challenge in NTN management. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of an AI-native ORAN-based NTN framework to support dynamic configuration, scalability, and intelligent orchestration. The paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature from leading industry and academic institutions, subsequently providing the necessary background knowledge related to ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the unique DevOps challenges for NTN and proposes the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework, with a detailed discussion on the key technological enablers within the framework. Finally, this paper presents various use cases and outlines the prospective research directions of this study in detail.</description>

      <title>AoA Services in 5G Networks: A Framework for Real-World Implementation and Systematic Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate positioning is a key enabler for emerging 5G applications. While the standardized Location Management Function (LMF) operates centrally within the core network, its scalability and latency limitations hinder low-latency and fine-grained localization. A practical alternative is to shift positioning intelligence toward the radio access network (RAN), where uplink sounding reference signal (SRS)-based angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation offers a lightweight, network-native solution. In this work, we present the first fully open-source 5G testbed for AoA estimation, enabling systematic and repeatable experimentation under realistic yet controllable channel conditions. The framework integrates the NVIDIA Sionna RT with a Keysight PROPSIM channel emulator and includes a novel phase calibration procedure for USRP N310 devices. Experimental results show sub-degree to few-degree accuracy, validating the feasibility of lightweight, single-anchor, network-native localization within next-generation 5G systems.</description>

      <title>P4-TAS: P4-Based Time-Aware Shaper for Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extends Ethernet with real-time capabilities. Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Distributed Routing in IoT Networks based on Multi-Objective Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IoT networks often face conflicting routing goals such as maximizing packet delivery, minimizing delay, and conserving limited battery energy. These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols. These results demonstrate significant gains in adaptability, delivery, and efficiency for dynamic IoT environments.</description>
