      <title>Models for nuclear fusion in the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical framework for enhancing nuclear fusion rates in solid-state environments under near-ambient conditions. Drawing on quantum tunneling, electron screening, and resonance energy transfer, the study proposes rate enhancements of more than 40 orders of magnitude for deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion in palladium lattices. A generalized nuclear Dicke model describes a fusion-fission process as a result of energy transfer between D-D and palladium mediated by lattice vibrations. Practical challenges such as decoherence, destructive interference, receiver decay, and achieving resonance between donor and receiver systems are addressed. Experimental strategies to validate the model are proposed along with its implications for the advancement of solid-state fusion as a potential pathway to sustainable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Planck Units Based in a Membranes Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the Planck units (mass, time and length) have only been derived, explained and attributed a physical meaning when they were deduced based on the concept of interacting membranes (membranes instead of strings of string theory). For this purpose, a set of five assumptions were proposed: (a) the existence of the interacting membranes; (b) the curvatures of the membranes oscillate according to the classical wave equation; (c) the spatial period of the wave that arise when the membranes oscillate is given by $\lambda = {\xi}{\pi}/k$; (d) the membranes oscillate with wavelength given by de Broglie relation and (e) $x=ct$ holds. The parameter $\xi$ determines the period of oscillation of the given membranes. In deriving the Planck units in this work, $\xi$ must take the value 2 and determines a period 2$\pi$, closely to minimum value 1 or to fundamental period $\pi$, respectively. In this context, Planck units must be fundamental. Moreover, the parameter $\xi$ was reported as a unification parameter between the formulas for the Coulomb$^{\prime}$s law and Newton$^{\prime}$s law of universal gravitation linking the forces of microworld and macroworld. Depending on the value $\xi$ takes, one force or another will be had. It is also shown that the potential $V = hc/{\xi}{\pi}x$ deduced from the above assumptions and which contributes to deduce the Planck units, can be derived from Yukawa$^{\prime}$s equation. Hence, the present work would be contributing to theoretical physics, since at the Planck scale predictions of some theories like Standard Model, quantum field theory and general relativity are not expected to be valid.</description>

      <title>Antimatter Gravity Experiments, the Astronomical Challenges to Lambda-CDM Cosmology and the Quantum Vacuum as a Possible Source of Gravity in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is motivated by the first result of the ALPHA-g experiment at CERN, which indicates that atoms and anti-atoms have different gravitational charges; according to measurements, the gravitational acceleration of anti-atoms is only 0.75 of that of ordinary matter. If confirmed by more precise measurements, this will greatly increase the plausibility of the emerging cosmological model, which is based on the working hypothesis that quantum vacuum fluctuations are virtual gravitational dipoles; a hypothesis that opens up the possibility that the quantum vacuum is a major source of gravity in the universe (which could eventually eliminate the need for the hypothetical dark matter and dark energy). This laboratory challenge to general relativity and Lambda-CDM cosmology is complemented by astronomical challenges (the Hubble tension, very fast initial growth of structures in the Universe, dark energy deviating from the cosmological constant...). The intriguing question is: do the antimatter gravity experiments at CERN and the recent astronomical observations point to the same (highly unexpected) new physics? With this question in mind, we briefly review the antimatter gravity experiments at CERN and elsewhere, together with the major astronomical challenges and the emerging Quantum Vacuum cosmology, which seems to be compatible with the ALPHA-g result and with the preliminary astronomical challenges. The laboratory and astronomical challenges have suddenly taken us into terra incognita, where we need absolutely unprecedented imagination and open-minded thinking.</description>
