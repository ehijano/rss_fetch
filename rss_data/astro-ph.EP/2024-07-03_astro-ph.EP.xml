      <title>Constraints on the gas-phase C/O ratio of DR Tau's outer disk from CS, SO, and C$_2$H observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS $5-4$, SO $7_6-6_5$ and $5_6-4_5$, C$_2$H $N=3-2$, HCN $3-2$, HCO$^+$ $3-2$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $3-2$ in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of $\sim0.4''$ (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from $\sim0.4-0.5$, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of $\sim180$ au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to $&lt;0.2$ at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau's low CS/SO ratio and faint C$_2$H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is $&lt;1$ at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau's SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by $^{13}$CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.</description>

      <title>Early stages of gap opening by planets in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annular substructures in protoplanetary discs, ubiquitous in sub-mm observations, can be caused by gravitational coupling between a disc and its embedded planets. Planetary density waves inject angular momentum into the disc leading to gap opening only after travelling some distance and steepening into shocks (in the absence of linear damping); no angular momentum is deposited in the planetary coorbital region, where the wave has not shocked yet. Despite that, simulations show mass evacuation from the coorbital region even in inviscid discs, leading to smooth, double-trough gap profiles. Here we consider the early, time-dependent stages of planetary gap opening in inviscid discs. We find that an often-overlooked contribution to the angular momentum balance caused by the time-variability of the specific angular momentum of the disc fluid (caused, in turn, by the time-variability of the radial pressure support) plays a key role in gap opening. Focusing on the regime of shallow gaps with depths of $\lesssim 20\%$, we demonstrate analytically that early gap opening is a self-similar process, with the amplitude of the planet-driven perturbation growing linearly in time and the radial gap profile that can be computed semi-analytically. We show that mass indeed gets evacuated from the coorbital region even in inviscid discs. This evolution pattern holds even in viscous discs over a limited period of time. These results are found to be in excellent agreement with 2D numerical simulations. Our simple gap evolution solutions can be used in studies of dust dynamics near planets and for interpreting protoplanetary disc observations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Instruments for Planetary Surface Science: Scientific Opportunities and Technology Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess the scientific promise and technology feasibility of distributed instruments for planetary science. A distributed instrument is an instrument designed to collect spatially and temporally correlated data from multiple networked, geographically distributed point sensors. Distributed instruments are ubiquitous in Earth science, where they are routinely employed for weather and climate science, seismic studies and resource prospecting, and detection of industrial emissions. However, to date, their adoption in planetary surface science has been minimal. It is natural to ask whether this lack of adoption is driven by low potential to address high-priority questions in planetary science; immature technology; or both. To address this question, we survey high-priority planetary science questions that are uniquely well-suited to distributed instruments. We identify four areas of research where distributed instruments hold promise to unlock answers that are largely inaccessible to monolithic sensors, namely, weather and climate studies of Mars; localization of seismic events on rocky and icy bodies; localization of trace gas emissions, primarily on Mars; and magnetometry studies of internal composition. Next, we survey enabling technologies for distributed sensors and assess their maturity. We identify sensor placement (including descent and landing on planetary surfaces), power, and instrument autonomy as three key areas requiring further investment to enable future distributed instruments. Overall, this work shows that distributed instruments hold great promise for planetary science, and paves the way for follow-on studies of future distributed instruments for Solar System in-situ science.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical Origins of the Dark Comets and a Proposed Evolutionary Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So-called 'dark comets' are small, morphologically inactive near-Earth objects (NEOs) that exhibit nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiative effects. These objects exhibit short rotational periods (minutes to hours), where measured. We find that the strengths required to prevent catastrophic disintegration are consistent with those measured in cometary nuclei and expected in rubble pile objects. We hypothesize that these dark comets are the end result of a rotational fragmentation cascade, which is consistent with their measured physical properties. We calculate the predicted size-frequency distribution for objects evolving under this model. Using dynamical simulations, we further demonstrate that the majority of these bodies originated from the $\nu_6$ resonance, implying the existence of volatiles in the current inner main belt. Moreover, one of the dark comets, (523599) 2003 RM, likely originated from the outer main belt, although a JFC origin is also plausible. These results provide strong evidence that volatiles from a reservoir in the inner main belt are present in the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>Rossby wave instability in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks. I. azimuthal or vertical B-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rossby wave instability (RWI) is considered the underlying mechanism to crescent-shaped azimuthal asymmetries, discovered in (sub-)millimeter dust continuum of many protoplanetary disks. Previous works on linear theory were conducted in the hydrodynamic limit. Nevertheless, protoplanetary disks are likely magnetized and weakly ionized. We examine the influence of magnetic fields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - namely, Ohmic resistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on the RWI unstable modes. We perform radially global linear analyses, employing constant azimuthal ($B_\phi$) or vertical ($B_z$) background magnetic fields. It is found that, in the ideal MHD regime, magnetism can either enhance or diminish RWI growth. Strong non-ideal MHD effects cause RWI growth rates to recover hydrodynamic results. The sign of Hall Els\"{a}sser number subtly complicates the results, and vertical wavenumbers generically diminish growth rates.</description>

      <title>Energetic proton losses reveal Io's extended and longitudinally asymmetrical atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along the I24, I27 and I31 flybys of Io (1999-2001), the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the Galileo spacecraft observed localised regions of energetic protons losses (155 keV-1250 keV). Using back-tracking particle simulations combined with a prescribed atmospheric distribution and a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the plasma/atmosphere interaction, we investigate the possible causes of these depletions. We focus on a limited region within two Io radii, which is dominated by Io's SO$_2$ atmosphere. Our results show that charge exchange of protons with the SO$_2$ atmosphere, absorption by the surface and the configuration of the electromagnetic field contribute to the observed proton depletion along the Galileo flybys. In the 155-240 keV energy range, charge exchange is either a major or the dominant loss process, depending on the flyby altitude. In the 540-1250 keV range, as the charge exchange cross sections are small, the observed decrease of the proton flux is attributed to absorption by the surface and the perturbed electromagnetic fields, which divert the protons away from the detector. From a comparison between the modelled losses and the data we find indications of an extended atmosphere on the day/downstream side of Io, a lack of atmospheric collapse on the night/upstream side as well as a more global extended atmospheric component ($&gt; 1$ Io radius). Our results demonstrate that observations and modeling of proton depletion around the moon constitute an important tool to constrain the electromagnetic field configuration around Io and the radial and longitudinal atmospheric distribution, which is still poorly understood.</description>

      <title>Geophysical Observations of the 24 September 2023 OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule Re-Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample Return Capsules (SRCs) entering Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity from interplanetary space are a valuable resource for studying meteor phenomena. The 24 September 2023 arrival of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC provided an unprecedented chance for geophysical observations of a well-characterized source with known parameters, including timing and trajectory. A collaborative effort involving researchers from 16 institutions executed a carefully planned geophysical observational campaign at strategically chosen locations, deploying over 400 ground-based sensors encompassing infrasound, seismic, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and GPS technologies. Additionally, balloons equipped with infrasound sensors were launched to capture signals at higher altitudes. This campaign (the largest of its kind so far) yielded a wealth of invaluable data anticipated to fuel scientific inquiry for years to come. The success of the observational campaign is evidenced by the near-universal detection of signals across instruments, both proximal and distal. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the collective scientific effort, field deployment, and preliminary findings. The early findings have the potential to inform future space missions and terrestrial campaigns, contributing to our understanding of meteoroid interactions with planetary atmospheres. Furthermore, the dataset collected during this campaign will improve entry and propagation models as well as augment the study of atmospheric dynamics and shock phenomena generated by meteoroids and similar sources.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in the simulated ozone distribution on TRAPPIST-1e due to orography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1e is a tidally locked rocky exoplanet orbiting the habitable zone of an M dwarf star. Upcoming observations are expected to reveal new rocky exoplanets and their atmospheres around M dwarf stars. To interpret these future observations we need to model the atmospheres of such exoplanets. We configured CESM2-WACCM6, a chemistry climate model, for the orbit and stellar irradiance of TRAPPIST-1e assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition. Our aim is to characterize the possible ozone (O$_3$) distribution and explore how this is influenced by the atmospheric circulation shaped by orography, using the Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass streamfunction. The model included Earth-like orography and the substellar point was located over the Pacific Ocean. For such a scenario, our analysis reveals a North-South asymmetry in the simulated O$_3$ distribution. The O$_3$ concentration is highest below 10 hPa level (below $\sim$30 km) near the South pole. This asymmetry results from the presence of land masses on the night side that cause drag in near-surface flows and lead to an asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. Catalytic species were roughly symmetrically distributed and were not found to be primary driver for the O$_3$ asymmetry. The total ozone column (TOC) density was higher for TRAPPIST-1e compared to Earth, with 8000 Dobson Units (DU) near the South pole and 2000 DU near the North pole. The results emphasize the sensitivity of O$_3$ to model parameters, illustrating how incorporating Earth-like orography can affect atmospheric dynamics and O$_3$ distribution. This link between surface features and atmospheric dynamics underlines the importance of how changing model parameters used to study exoplanet atmospheres can influence the interpretation of observations.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Young Cloudy L-Dwarfs: A Nearby Planetary-Mass Companion BD+60 1417B and Its Isolated Red Twin W0047</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of young, cloudy, red L-dwarfs -- CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 and WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 -- using the \textit{Brewster} retrieval framework. We also present the first elemental abundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417 using high resolution~(R = 50,000) spectra taken with PEPSI/LBT. In the complex cloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates retrieval analysis when only near-infrared data is available. We find that for both L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile parameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements and thus the C/O ratio. While we can not conclude what the abundances are, we can conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model. We note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the signal to noise of the data examined (S/N $\sim$ 10 for CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 and~40 for WISEP J004701.06+680352.1). The results presented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young, low-surface gravity, cloudy L-dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of missing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform retrieval analysis in this regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and solar wind control of the recovery of strong geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the characteristics and dynamical changes during the recovery time of moderate and strong geomagnetic storms (Dst $&lt;-50$ nT). Investigating 57 storms triggered by CMEs/CIRs, we focused on the solar wind's influence on their decay phases. Selected storms were classified into distinct groups based on their recovery characteristics. Using superposed epoch analysis and best fit methods, we scrutinized several interplanetary solar wind plasma and field parameters/functions. The analysis included single, dual, and multiple interplanetary plasma and field parameters/functions. We determined the most representative characteristic time for the storm's recovery profile by fitting an exponential curve. A correlation analysis between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions isolated a coupling function ($\rho^{1/2}$Ey) best describing the decay rate of the ring current. This shows that the electric field term (Ey) coupled with a viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) plays a pivotal role in determining the recovery rate of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we modeled the complex patterns of Dst recovery in relation to solar wind parameters/functions using a second-order polynomial. During the recovery phase, a dynamic correlation between Dst and solar wind parameters/functions was revealed. The three-parameter solar wind-magnetosphere electrodynamical coupling function, combining the viscous term ($\rho^{1/2}$) and the electric field-related function (v$^{4/3}$B) ($\rho^{1/2}$v$^{4/3}$B), significantly impacts the recovery phase of geomagnetic disturbances. Our investigation extended to the relationship between main and recovery phase durations, providing valuable insights into the solar wind's control over the decay of geomagnetic disturbances. These findings advance our comprehension of the complex relationship between solar wind dynamics and the evolution of geomagnetic disturbances.</description>

      <title>How Land-Mass Distribution Influences the Atmospheric Dynamics of Tidally Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially-habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally-locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land-ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres and with the sub-stellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere are $50\rightarrow100\%$ faster than similar jets in the northern hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material towards the south-pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of land-mass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the day-side land-fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modelling a flat land-mass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.</description>
