      <title>Solar photospheric spectrum microvariability II. Observed relations to magnetic activity and radial-velocity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for small exoplanets around solar-type stars are limited by stellar physical variability. While chromospheric variability is well studied, observing, modeling. and understanding the much smaller fluctuations in photospheric spectral line strengths, shapes, and shifts is challenging. Extreme precision radial-velocity spectrometers now enable extreme precision stellar spectroscopy and time series of the Sun seen as a star permit monitoring of its photospheric variability. Fluctuations in their line strengths may well correlate with radial-velocity excursions and identify observable proxies for their monitoring. From three years of HARPS-N observations of the Sun-as-a-star, one thousand low-noise spectra are selected, and line absorption measured in Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Mn I, H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, Na I, and the G-band. Their variations and likely atmospheric origins are examined, also with respect to simultaneously measured chromospheric emission and apparent radial velocity. Systematic line-strength variability is seen, largely shadowing the solar-cycle evolution of Ca II H &amp; K emission, but with smaller amounts, typically on a sub-percent level. Among iron lines, greatest amplitudes are for Fe II in the blue, while the trends change sign among differently strong lines in the green Mg I triplet and between Balmer lines. Variations in the G-band core are greater than of the full G-band, in line with theoretical predictions. No variation is detected in the semi-forbidden Mg I 457.1 nm. Hyperfine split Mn I behaves largely similar to Fe I. For lines at longer wavelengths, telluric absorption limits the achievable precision. Microvariability in the solar photospheric spectrum thus displays systematic signatures among various features. These measure something different than the classical Ca II H &amp; K index while still reflecting a strong influence from magnetic regions.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Young Stellar Populations in NGC 1783: Accretion of External Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multi-epoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster, and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfv\'en Wave Reflection in the Solar Chromosphere: Ponderomotive Force and First Ionization Potential Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in the solar chromosphere, distinguishing between upward and downward propagating waves. We find clear evidence for the reflection of waves in the chromosphere and differences in propagation between cases with waves interpreted to be resonant or nonresonant with the overlying coronal structures. This establishes the wave connection to coronal element abundance anomalies through the action of the wave ponderomotive force on the chromospheric plasma, which interacts with chromospheric ions but not neutrals, thereby providing a novel mechanism of ion-neutral separation. This is seen as a "First Ionization Potential Effect" when this plasma is lifted into the corona, with implications elsewhere on the Sun for the origin of the slow speed solar wind and its elemental composition.</description>

      <title>MINCE II. Neutron capture elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to gather the abundances of neutron-capture elements but also of light elements and iron peak elements in a large sample of giant stars in this metallicity range. T The aim of this work is to study the chemical evolution of galactic sub-components recently identified (i.e. Gaia Sausage Enceladus (GSE), Sequoia). We used high signal-to-noise ratios, high-resolution spectra and standard 1D LTE spectrum synthesis to determine the detailed abundances. We could determine the abundances for up to 10 neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu) in 33 stars. The general trends of abundance ratios [n-capture element/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are in agreement with the results found in the literature. When our sample is divided in sub-groups depending on their kinematics, we found that the run of [Sr/Ba] vs [Ba/H] for the stars belonging to the GSE accretion event shows a tight anti-correlation. The results for the Sequoia stars, although based on a very limited sample, shows a [Sr/Ba] systematically higher than the [Sr/Ba] found in the GSE stars at a given [Ba/H] hinting at a different nucleosynthetic history. Stochastic chemical evolution models have been computed to understand the evolution of the GSE chemical composition of Sr and Ba. The first conclusions are that the GSE chemical evolution is similar to the evolution of a dwarf galaxy with galactic winds and inefficient star formation.
  Detailed abundances of neutron-capture elements have been measured in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of intermediate metal-poor stars, the metallicity range covered by the MINCE project. These abundances have been compared to detailed stochastic models of galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Absolute dimensions of solar-type eclipsing binaries. NY Hya: A test for magnetic stellar evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary star NY Hya is a bright, detached, double-lined eclipsing system with an orbital period of just under five days with two components each nearly identical to the Sun and located in the solar neighbourhood.
  The objective of this study is to test and confront various stellar evolution models for solar-type stars based on accurate measurements of stellar mass and radius.
  We present new ground-based spectroscopic and photometric as well as high-precision space-based photometric and astrometric data from which we derive orbital as well as physical properties of the components via the method of least-squares minimisation based on a standard binary model valid for two detached components. Classic statistical techniques were invoked to test the significance of model parameters. Additional empirical evidence was compiled from the public domain; the derived system properties were compared with archival broad-band photometry data enabling a measurement of the system's spectral energy distribution that allowed an independent estimate of stellar properties. We also utilised semi-empirical calibration methods to derive atmospheric properties from Str\"{o}mgren photometry and related colour indices. Data was used to confront the observed physical properties with classic and magnetic stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Analytic approximations for massive close post-mass transfer binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive binary evolution models are needed to predict massive star populations in star forming galaxies, the supernova diversity, and the number and properties of gravitational wave sources. Such models are often computed using so called rapid binary evolution codes, which approximate the evolution of the binary components based on detailed single star models. However, about one third of the interacting massive binary stars undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning (Case A mass transfer), whose outcome is difficult to derive from single star models. Here, we use a large grid of detailed binary evolution models for primaries in the initial mass range 10 to 40 Solar masses of LMC and SMC composition, to derive analytic fits for the key quantities needed in rapid binary evolution codes, i.e., the duration of core hydrogen burning, and the resulting donor star mass. Systems with shorter orbital periods produce up to 50% lighter stripped donors and have a up to 30% larger lifetime than wider systems. We find that both quantities depend strongly on the initial binary orbital period, but that the initial mass ratio and the mass transfer efficiency of the binary have little impact on the outcome. Our results are easily parameterisable and can be used to capture the effects of Case A mass transfer more accurately in rapid binary evolution codes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the borderline between stable mass transfer and mergers in close binary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars reside in binary systems, which are expected to experience mass transfer during their evolution. However, so far the conditions under which mass transfer leads to a common envelope, and thus possibly to a merging of both stars, are not well understood. Main uncertainties arise from the possible swelling of the mass gainer, and from angular momentum loss from the binary system, during non-conservative mass transfer. We have computed a dense grid of detailed models of stars accreting mass at constant rates, to determine their radius increase due to their thermal disequilibrium. While we find that models with faster than thermal timescale accretion generally expand, this expansion remains quite limited in the intermediate mass regime even for accretion rates which exceed the thermal timescale accretion rate by a factor of 100. Our models of massive accretion stars expand to extreme radii under those conditions. When the accretion rate exceed the Eddington accretion rate, our models expand dynamically. We have derived analytical fits to the radius evolution of our models and a prescription for the borderline between stable mass transfer and mergers for arbitrary accretion efficiencies. We then apply our results to grids of binary models adopting various constant mass transfer efficiencies and angular momentum budgets. We find that the former parameter has the stronger effect on the outcome of the Roche lobe overflow. Our results are consistent with detailed binary evolution models, and often lead to a smaller initial parameter space for stable mass transfer than other recipes in the literature. We use this method to investigate the origin of the Wolf-Rayet stars with O star companions in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and find that the efficiency of the mass transfer process which lead to the formation of the Wolf-Rayet star was likely below 50%.</description>

      <title>Imaging dark matter at the smallest scales with lensed stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7&lt;z&lt;1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\beta&gt;2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\beta&lt;2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^8\,\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (&lt; yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at &lt;10 au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure and Millimeter Emission of Protoplanetary Disk with embedded protoplanets from radiative transfer modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of protoplanets and circumplanetary disks provides a unique opportunity to characterize planet formation through observations. Massive protoplanets shape the physical and chemical structure of their host circumstellar disk by accretion, localized emission, and disk depletion. In this work, we study the thermal changes induced within the disk by protoplanet accretion and synthetic predictions through hydrodynamical simulations with post-processed radiative transfer with an emphasis on radio millimeter emission. We explored distinct growth conditions and varied both planetary accretion rates and the local dust-to-gas mass ratios for a protoplanet at 1200 K. The radiative transfer models show that beyond the effect of disk gaps, in most cases, the CPD and the planet's emission locally increase the disk temperature. Moreover, depending on the local dust-to-gas depletion and accretion rate, the CPD presence may have detectable signatures in millimeter emission. It also has the power to generate azimuthal asymmetries important for continuum subtraction. Thus, if other means of detection of protoplanets are proven, the lack of corresponding evidence at other wavelengths can set limits on their growth timescales through a combined analysis of the local dust-to-gas ratio and the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Spectrophotometry Reveals Inefficient Day-to-Night Heat Redistribution in the Highly Irradiated Brown Dwarf SDSS 1557B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally-locked, fast rotating (1-3 hr), and highly-irradiated atmospheres. Here, we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the white dwarf-brown dwarf (WD-BD) binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD-BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m phase curves show rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of 10.5$\pm$0.1%. We observe a wavelength dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model recreates the hemisphere integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the night side, whereas the featureless day side spectrum is likely dominated by H$^-$ opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly-irradiated BD EPIC2122B.</description>

Abstract: WASP-18 is an F6V star that hosts a planet with a mass of about 10 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 0.94 days. In spite of its relatively fast rotation and young age, the star remains undetected in X-rays, thus implying a very low level of magnetic activity. To account for such unexpected properties, we propose a mechanism that modifies the internal stratification and the photospheric magnetic activity of a late-type main sequence star with a close-by massive planet based on the action of the equilibrium tide. We speculate that the horizontal flow produced by the equilibrium tide may interact with the convective plumes in the overshoot layer below the stellar outer convective envelope. The interaction is characterized by a very high Reynolds number leading to the development of turbulent boundary layers at the surface of such structures, whereas turbulent wakes extend over most of the overshoot layer that they straddle. We propose that such a tidally induced turbulence can lead to a reduction of the filling factor of the downdrafts in the overshoot layer. As a consequence, the absolute value of the sub-adiabatic gradient increases in that layer hindering the emergence of magnetic flux tubes responsible for the formation of photospheric starspots. We conjecture that this process is occurring in WASP-18, thus providing a possible mechanism to account for the very low level of magnetic activity observed for such a planet host.</description>

      <title>The radius variations of accreting main sequence stars and mass transfer instability</title>

Abstract: Many previous works studied the dynamical timescale mass transfer stability criteria based on the donor response with neglecting the stellar structure of the accretor. In this letter, we investigate the radial response of accretors with mass accumulation and its effect on the binary mass transfer stability. We perform a series of detailed stellar evolution simulations with different types of accretors and obtain the radial variations of stars accreting at different rates. Since the time within which the donor loses half of the original mass has a correlation with the donor mass, we approximately obtain the mean mass transfer rate as a function of mass ratio. Assuming that the common envelope (CE) phase occurs if the accretor radius exceeds the outer Roche lobe radius, we obtain the critical mass ratio of dynamically unstable mass transfer. We find the critical mass ratios for donors filling their Roche lobes at the Main Sequence (MS) and Hertzsprung Gap (HG) stages are smaller than that derived from the radial response of the donor in the traditional way. Our results may suggest that the binary is easier to enter into the CE phase for a donor star at the MS or HG stage than previously believed.</description>

      <title>The ZTF Source Classification Project: III. A Catalog of Variable Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00143</link>

Abstract: The classification of variable objects provides insight into a wide variety of astrophysics ranging from stellar interiors to galactic nuclei. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) provides time series observations that record the variability of more than a billion sources. The scale of these data necessitates automated approaches to make a thorough analysis. Building on previous work, this paper reports the results of the ZTF Source Classification Project (SCoPe), which trains neural network and XGBoost machine learning (ML) algorithms to perform dichotomous classification of variable ZTF sources using a manually constructed training set containing 170,632 light curves. We find that several classifiers achieve high precision and recall scores, suggesting the reliability of their predictions for 209,991,147 light curves across 77 ZTF fields. We also identify the most important features for XGB classification and compare the performance of the two ML algorithms, finding a pattern of higher precision among XGB classifiers. The resulting classification catalog is available to the public, and the software developed for SCoPe is open-source and adaptable to future time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.

      <title>Relative Occurrence Rate Between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator to Probe Planet Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.</description>
