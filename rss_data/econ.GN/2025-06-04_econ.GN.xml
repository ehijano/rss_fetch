      <title>Green Shields: The Role of ESG in Uncertain Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of sustainable investing, now exceeding 35 trillion USD globally, has transformed financial markets, yet the implications for monetary policy transmission remain underexplored. While existing literature documents heterogeneous firm responses to monetary policy through traditional channels such as size and leverage, it remains unknown whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics create distinct transmission mechanisms. Using high-frequency identification around 160 Federal Reserve announcements from 2005 to 2025, we uncover an asymmetric pattern: high-ESG firms gain 1.6 basis points of protection from contractionary target surprises, yet suffer 2.6 basis points greater sensitivity to forward guidance shocks. This asymmetry persists within industries and intensifies with investor climate awareness. Remarkably, the Paris Agreement inverted these relationships: before December 2015, high-ESG firms were more vulnerable to contractionary policy within industries; afterward, they gained protection, representing a 186 basis point reversal. We develop a two-period model featuring heterogeneous investors with sustainability preferences that quantitatively matches these patterns. The model reveals how ESG investors' non-pecuniary utility creates differential demand elasticities, simultaneously protecting green firms from immediate rate changes while amplifying forward guidance vulnerability through their longer investment horizons. These findings establish environmental characteristics as a new dimension of monetary policy non-neutrality, with important implications as sustainable finance continues expanding.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Communication with Public: Bank of England and Twitter (X)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central banks increasingly use social media to communicate beyond financial markets, yet evidence on public engagement effectiveness remains limited. Despite 113 central banks joining Twitter between 2008 and 2018, we lack understanding of what drives audience interaction with their content. To examine engagement determinants, we analyzed 3.13 million tweets mentioning the Bank of England from 2007 to 2022, including 9,810 official posts. We investigate posting patterns, measure engagement elasticity, and identify content characteristics predicting higher interaction. The Bank's posting schedule misaligns with peak audience engagement times, with evening hours generating the highest interaction despite minimal posting. Cultural content, such as the Alan Turing 50 pound note, achieved 1,300 times higher engagement than routine policy communications. Engagement elasticity averaged 1.095 with substantial volatility during events like Brexit, contrasting with the Federal Reserve's stability. Media content dramatically increased engagement: videos by 1,700 percent, photos by 126 percent, while monetary policy announcements and readability significantly enhanced all metrics. Content quality and timing matter more than posting frequency for effective central bank communication. These findings suggest central banks should prioritize accessible, media-rich content during high-attention periods rather than increasing volume, with implications for digital communication strategies in fulfilling public transparency mandates.</description>

      <title>TaxAgent: How Large Language Model Designs Fiscal Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Company Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</description>

      <title>Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring factuality of content generation.</description>
