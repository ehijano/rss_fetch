      <title>Vector-valued Graph Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical graph signal processing (GSP) introduces methodologies for analyzing real or complex signals defined on graph domains, moving beyond classical uniform sampling techniques, such as the graph discrete Fourier transform (GDFT), employed as a pivotal tool for transforming graph signals into their spectral representation, enabling effective signal processing techniques such as filtering and denoising. In this paper, we propose a possible generalization of the set of signals and we study some properties of the more general set of vector-valued signals, which take values into any Banach space, and some properties of the fundamental operators of vertex-frequency analysis acting on these signals, such as the Fourier transform, the convolution operator and the translation operator. In particular, we show some estimates involving their operator norm as linear operators between Banach spaces and we establish a graph version of the classical primary uncertainty principle. We also show how these estimates depend on the choice of an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{K}^N$. The importance of considering this general set of signals derives from the possibility to study multiple signals at the same time and the correlation existing between them, since multiple scalar signals can be modelled as a unique vector-valued signal.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics Of Quadratic And Cubic Planar Quasi-homogeneous Differential Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the global dynamics and phase portraits of quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous systems. We first prove that all planar quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous polynomial systems can be reduced to three homogeneous ones. Then for the homogeneous systems, we employ blow-up method, normal sector method, Poincar\'e compactification and other techniques to discuss their dynamics. Finally we characterize the global phase portraits of quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal growth of upper frequently hypercyclic functions for some weighted Taylor shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the optimal growth in terms of $L^p$-averages of hypercyclic and $\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic functions for some weighted Taylor shift operators acting on the space of analytic function on the unit disc. We unify the results obtained by considering intermediate notions of upper frequent hypercyclicity between the $\mathcal{U}$-frequent hypercyclicity and the hypercyclicity.</description>

      <title>Physical measures for mostly sectional expanding flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a partially hyperbolic attracting set for a C2 vector field, having slow recurrence to equilibria, supports an ergodic physical/SRB measure if, and only if, the trapping region admits non-uniform sectional expansion on a positive Lebesgue measure subset. Moreover, in this case, the attracting set supports at most finitely many ergodic physical/SRB measures, which are also Gibbs states along the central-unstable direction.
  This extends to continuous time systems a similar well-known result obtained for diffeomorphisms, encompassing the presence of equilibria accumulated by regular orbits within the attracting set. In codimension two the same result holds, assuming only the trajetories on the trapping region admit a sequence of times with asymptotical sectional expansion, on a positive volume subset.
  We present several examples of application, including the existence of physical measures for asymptotically sectional hyperbolic attracting sets, and obtain physical measures in an alternative unified way for many known examples: Lorenz-like and Rovella attractors, and sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets (including the multidimensional Lorenz attractor).</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>
