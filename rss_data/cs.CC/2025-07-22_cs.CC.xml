      <title>Pseudorandomness of Expander Walks via Fourier Analysis on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One approach to study the pseudorandomness properties of walks on expander graphs is to label the vertices of an expander with elements from an alphabet $\Sigma$, and study the mean of functions over $\Sigma^n$. We say expander walks $\varepsilon$-fool a function if, for any unbiased labeling of the vertices, the expander walk mean is $\varepsilon$-close to the true mean. We show that:
  - The class of symmetric functions is $O(|\Sigma|\cdot\lambda)$-fooled by expander walks over any generic $\lambda$-expander, and any alphabet $\Sigma$ . This generalizes the result of Cohen, Peri, Ta-Shma [STOC'21] which analyzes it for $|\Sigma| =2$, and exponentially improves the previous bound of $O(|\Sigma|^{O(|\Sigma|)}\cdot \lambda)$, by Golowich and Vadhan [CCC'22]. Additionally, if the expander is a Cayley graph over $\mathbb{Z}_{|\Sigma|}$, we get a further improved bound of $O(\sqrt{|\Sigma|}\cdot\lambda)$.
  Morever, when $\Sigma$ is a finite group $G$, we show the following for functions over $G^n$:
  - The class of symmetric class functions is $O\Big({\frac{\sqrt{|G|}}{D}\cdot\lambda}\Big)$-fooled by expander walks over "structured" $\lambda$-expanders, if $G$ is $D$-quasirandom.
  - We show a lower bound of $\Omega(\lambda)$ for symmetric functions for any finite group $G$ (even for "structured" $\lambda$-expanders).
  - We study the Fourier spectrum of a class of non-symmetric functions arising from word maps, and show that they are exponentially fooled by expander walks.
  Our proof employs Fourier analysis over general groups, which contrasts with earlier works that have studied either the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$. This enables us to get quantitatively better bounds even for unstructured sets.</description>

      <title>Certificate-Sensitive Subset Sum: Realizing Instance Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first deterministic, certificate-sensitive algorithm for a canonical NP-complete problem whose runtime provably adapts to the structure of each input. For a Subset-Sum instance $(S, t)$, let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of distinct subset sums and define $U = |\Sigma(S)|$. This set serves as an information-theoretically minimal witness, the instance-complexity (IC) certificate.
  Our solver, IC-SubsetSum, enumerates every element of $\Sigma(S)$ in deterministic time $O(U \cdot n^2)$ and space $O(U \cdot n)$. A randomized variant achieves expected runtime $O(U \cdot n)$. The algorithm's complexity is thus directly governed by the certificate size, and this structure-sensitive performance is paired with a guaranteed worst-case runtime of $O^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the first such result to strictly outperform classical methods on every instance.
  We revisit fine-grained reductions that rely on the classical $2^{n/2}$ hardness of SubsetSum and show that these arguments hold only for collision-free instances where $U$ is maximal. IC-SubsetSum reframes this barrier structurally and introduces a new paradigm for certificate-sensitive algorithms across NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data $x$ and Bob holds $m$ inputs $y_1,... , y_m$. They want to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation $R$ on every pair $(x, y_1),\ldots, (x, y_m)$. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$. Thus, for such problems, data behaves like a consumable resource that is effectively destroyed upon use when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states, but not when transmitted classically. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>

      <title>Tighter Lower Bounds for Single Source Personalized PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study lower bounds for approximating the Single Source Personalized PageRank (SSPPR) query, which measures the probability distribution of an $\alpha$-decay random walk starting from a source node $s$. Existing lower bounds remain loose-$\Omega\left(\min(m, 1/\delta)\right)$ for relative error (SSPPR-R) and $\Omega\left(\min(n, 1/\epsilon)\right)$ for additive error (SSPPR-A). To close this gap, we establish tighter bounds for both settings. For SSPPR-R, we show a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left(m, \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}\right)\right)$ for any $\delta \in (0,1)$. For SSPPR-A, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left(m, \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ for any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, assuming the graph has $m \in \mathcal{O}(n^{2-\beta})$ edges for any arbitrarily small constant $\beta \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Studying homing and synchronizing sequences for Timed Finite State Machines with output delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces final state identification (synchronizing and homing) sequences for Timed Finite State Machines (TFSMs) with output delays and investigates their properties. We formally define the notions of homing sequences (HSs) and synchronizing sequences (SSs) for these TFSMs and demonstrate that several properties that hold for untimed machines do not necessarily apply to timed ones. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of various approaches for deriving SSs and HSs for Timed FSMs with output delays, such as truncated successor tree-based and FSM abstraction-based methods. Correspondingly, we identify the subclasses of TFSMs for which these approaches can be directly applied and those for which other methods are required. Additionally, we evaluate the complexity of existence check and derivation of (shortest) HSs / SSs for TFSMs with output delays.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Relevant Quantities of Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social networks have become an integral part of modern society, profoundly influencing how individuals form and exchange opinions across diverse domains ranging from politics to public health. The Friedkin-Johnsen model serves as a foundational framework for modeling opinion formation dynamics in such networks. In this paper, we address the computational task of efficiently determining the equilibrium opinion vector and associated metrics including polarization and disagreement, applicable to both directed and undirected social networks. We propose a deterministic local algorithm with relative error guarantees, scaling to networks exceeding ten million nodes. Further acceleration is achieved through integration with successive over-relaxation techniques, where a relaxation factor optimizes convergence rates. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world networks validate the practical effectiveness of our approaches, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Faceted Explanations in Propositional Abduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems (counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore, we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation (relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations (heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings, including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.</description>

      <title>Weighted Pseudorandom Generators for Read-Once Branching Programs via Weighted Pseudorandom Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs) and derandomizations for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results.
  For standard ROBPs, we give an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length
  $$O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log \frac{n}{\varepsilon}}\right\}\right)+\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right).$$
  For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, we give an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length
  $$O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$
  We also give a new Nisan-Zuckerman style derandomization for regular ROBPs with width $w$, length $n = 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}$, and multiple accept nodes. We attain optimal space complexity $O(\log w)$ for arbitrary approximation error $\varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} (w)$.
  All our results are based on iterative weighted pseudorandom reductions, which can iteratively reduce fooling long ROBPs to fooling short ones.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separations for RPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While theoretical computer science primarily works with discrete models of computation, like the Turing machine and the wordRAM, there are many scenarios in which introducing real computation models is more adequate. We want to compare real models of computation with discrete models of computation. We do this by means of oracle separation results.
  We define the notion of a real Turing machine as an extension of the (binary) Turing machine by adding a real tape. Using those machines, we define and study the real polynomial hierarchy RPH. We are interested in RPH as the first level of the hierarchy corresponds to the well-known complexity class ER. It is known that $NP \subseteq ER \subseteq PSPACE$ and furthermore $PH \subseteq RPH \subseteq PSPACE$. We are interested to know if any of those inclusions are tight. In the absence of unconditional separations of complexity classes, we turn to oracle separation. We develop a technique that allows us to transform oracle separation results from the binary world to the real world. As applications, we show there are oracles such that:
  - $RPH^O$ proper subset of $PSPACE^O$,
  - $\Sigma_{k+1}^O$ not contained in $\Sigma_kR^O$, for all $k\geq 0$,
  - $\Sigma_kR^O$ proper subset of $\Sigma_{k+1}R^O$, for all $k\geq 0$,
  - $BQP^O$ not contained in $RPH^O$.
  Our results indicate that ER is strictly contained in PSPACE and that there is a separation between the different levels of the real polynomial hierarchy. We also bound the power of real computations by showing that NP-hard problems are unlikely to be solvable using polynomial time on a realRAM. Furthermore, our oracle separations indicate that polynomial-time quantum computing cannot be simulated on an efficient real Turing machine.</description>

      <title>On optimal distinguishers for Planted Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a distinguishing problem, the input is a sample drawn from one of two distributions and the algorithm is tasked with identifying the source distribution. The performance of a distinguishing algorithm is measured by its advantage, i.e., its incremental probability of success over a random guess. A classic example of a distinguishing problem is the Planted Clique problem, where the input is a graph sampled from either $G(n,1/2)$ -- the standard Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, or $G(n,1/2,k)$ -- the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model with a clique planted on a random subset of $k$ vertices. The Planted Clique Hypothesis asserts that efficient algorithms cannot achieve advantage better than some absolute constant, say $1/4$, whenever $k=n^{1/2-\Omega(1)}$. In this work, we aim to precisely understand the optimal distinguishing advantage achievable by efficient algorithms on Planted Clique. We show the following results under the Planted Clique hypothesis:
  1. Optimality of low-degree polynomials: No efficient algorithm can beat the advantage the optimal low-degree polynomial. Concretely, this means that the advantage of any efficient algorithm is at most $(1+o(1))\cdot k^2/(\sqrt{\pi}n)$, which is optimal in light of a simple edge-counting algorithm achieving this bound.
  2. Harder planted distributions: There is an efficiently sampleable distribution $\mathcal{P}^*$ supported on graphs containing $k$-cliques such that no efficient algorithm can distinguish $\mathcal{P}^*$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $n^{-d}$ for an arbitrarily large constant $d$. In other words, there exist alternate planted distributions that are much harder than $G(n,1/2,k)$. Along the way, we prove a constructive hard-core lemma for a broad class of distributions with respect to low-degree polynomials. This result is applicable much more widely beyond Planted Clique and might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07409v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arunachalam and de Wolf (2018) showed that the sample complexity of quantum batch learning of boolean functions, in the realizable and agnostic settings, has the same form and order as the corresponding classical sample complexities. In this paper, we extend this, ostensibly surprising, message to batch multiclass learning, online boolean learning, and online multiclass learning. For our online learning results, we first consider an adaptive adversary variant of the classical model of Dawid and Tewari (2022). Then, we introduce the first (to the best of our knowledge) model of online learning with quantum examples.</description>

      <title>Interactive proofs for verifying (quantum) learning and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>
