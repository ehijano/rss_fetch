      <title>Evaluation of optimal cut-offs and dichotomous combinations for two biomarkers to improve patient selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Identifying the right cut-off for continuous biomarkers in clinical trials is important to identify subgroups of patients who are at greater risk of disease or more likely to benefit from a drug. The literature in this area tends to focus on finding cut-offs for a single biomarker, whereas clinical trials more often focus on multiple biomarkers. Methods Our first objective was to compare three methods,Youden index, point closest to the (0,1) corner on the receiving operator characteristic curve (ER), and concordance probability, to find the optimal cut-offs for two biomarkers, using empirical and non-empirical approaches. Our second and main objective was to use our proposed logic indicator approach to extend the Youden index and evaluate whether a combination of biomarkers is an improvement over a single biomarker. Results The logic indicator approach created a condition in which either both biomarkers were positive or only one of the biomarkers was positive. A prostate cancer study and a simulated phase 2 lung cancer study were used to illustrate approaches to finding optimal cut-offs and comparing combined biomarkers with single biomarkers. Conclusion Our results can aid in determining whether a single biomarker or a combination of biomarkers is superior in identifying patients who are more likely to respond to treatment. This work can be of great importance in the era of personalized medicine, where many treatments do not provide clinical benefit to average patients.</description>

      <title>Representation Meets Optimization: Training PINNs and PIKANs for Gray-Box Discovery in Systems Pharmacology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) are gaining attention as an effective counterpart to the original multilayer perceptron-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Both representation models can address inverse problems and facilitate gray-box system identification. However, a comprehensive understanding of their performance in terms of accuracy and speed remains underexplored. In particular, we introduce a modified PIKAN architecture, tanh-cPIKAN, which is based on Chebyshev polynomials for parametrization of the univariate functions with an extra nonlinearity for enhanced performance. We then present a systematic investigation of how choices of the optimizer, representation, and training configuration influence the performance of PINNs and PIKANs in the context of systems pharmacology modeling. We benchmark a wide range of first-order, second-order, and hybrid optimizers, including various learning rate schedulers. We use the new Optax library to identify the most effective combinations for learning gray-boxes under ill-posed, non-unique, and data-sparse conditions. We examine the influence of model architecture (MLP vs. KAN), numerical precision (single vs. double), the need for warm-up phases for second-order methods, and sensitivity to the initial learning rate. We also assess the optimizer scalability for larger models and analyze the trade-offs introduced by JAX in terms of computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. Using two representative systems pharmacology case studies - a pharmacokinetics model and a chemotherapy drug-response model - we offer practical guidance on selecting optimizers and representation models/architectures for robust and efficient gray-box discovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for improving the training of physics-informed networks in biomedical applications and beyond.</description>

      <title>Convergence-divergence models: Generalizations of phylogenetic trees modeling gene flow over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are simple models of evolutionary processes. They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the geometry of the respiratory tract in viral infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, experimentalists and modellers alike have come to recognise the important role of spatial structure in infection dynamics. Almost invariably, spatial computational models of viral infections - as with in vitro experimental systems - represent the tissue as wide and flat, which is often assumed to be representative of entire affected tissue within the host. However, this assumption fails to take into account the distinctive geometry of the respiratory tract in the context of viral infections. The respiratory tract is characterised by a tubular, branching structure, and moreover is spatially heterogeneous: deeper regions of the lung are composed of far narrower airways and are associated with more severe infection. Here, we extend a typical multicellular model of viral dynamics to account for two essential features of the geometry of the respiratory tract: the tubular structure of airways, and the branching process between airway generations. We show that, with this more realistic tissue geometry, the dynamics of infection are substantially changed compared to standard computational and experimental approaches, and that the resulting model is equipped to tackle important biological phenomena that do not arise in a flat host tissue, including viral lineage dynamics, and heterogeneity in immune responses to infection in different regions of the respiratory tree. Our findings suggest aspects of viral dynamics which current in vitro systems may be insufficient to describe, and point to several features of respiratory infections which can be experimentally assessed.</description>

      <title>Cell size distributions in lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells actively regulate their size during the cell cycle to maintain volume homeostasis across generations. While various mathematical models of cell size regulation have been proposed to explain how this is achieved, relating these models to experimentally observed cell size distributions has proved challenging. In this paper we present a simple formula for the cell size distribution in lineages as observed in e.g. a mother machine, and provide a new derivation for the corresponding result in populations, assuming exponential cell growth. Our results are independent of the underlying cell size control mechanism and explain the characteristic shape underlying experimentally observed cell size distributions. We furthermore derive universal moment identities for these distributions, and show that our predictions agree well with experimental measurements of E. coli cells, both on the distribution and the moment level.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.</description>
