      <title>Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks, Moralisation, Triangulation: a Categorical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of natural directed paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract setting of presheaf category on a thick category of cubes. Precubical sets, symmetric transverse sets, symmetric precubical sets and the new category of (non-symmetric) transverse sets are examples of this structure. All these presheaf categories share the same metric and homotopical properties from a directed homotopy point of view. This enables us to extend Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path for each of them. Finally, we adapt Ziemia\'{n}ski's notion of cube chain to this abstract setting and we prove that it has the expected behavior on precubical sets. As an application, we verify that the formalization of the parallel composition with synchronization of process algebra using the coskeleton functor of the category of symmetric transverse sets has a category of cube chains with the correct homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Day algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Day monoidal product generalises in a straightforward way to other algebraic constructions and partial algebraic constructions on categories. This generalisation was motivated by its applications in logic, for example in hybrid and separation logic. We use the description of the Day monoidal product using profunctors to show that the definition generalises to an extension of an arbitrary algebraic structure on a category to a pseudo-algebraic structure on a functor category. We provide two further extensions. First we consider the case where some of the operations on the category are partial, and second we show that the resulting operations on the functor category have adjoints (they are residuated).</description>

      <title>Symmetric weak multicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multicategory is what remains of a monoidal category when monoidal product is not available. A weak multicategory means that hom-sets are in fact categories, and in place of usual equations, there are natural isomorphisms, which have to satisfy their own equations. A symmetric weak multicategory implies a weak multicategory with a weak (up to a cocycle) action of symmetric groups.</description>
