      <title>Skew monoidal structures on actegories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of skew monoidal structures from strong actions. We prove that the existence of a certain adjoint allows one to equip the actegory with a skew monoidal structure and that this adjunction becomes monoidal. This construction provides a unifying framework for the description of several examples of skew monoidal categories. We also demonstrate how braidings on the original monoidal category of a given action induce braidings on the resulting skew monoidal structure on the actegory and describe sufficient conditions for closedness of the resulting skew monoidal structure.</description>

      <title>Horizontal Descent, Immersions, Unramified Morphisms, Submersions, \'Etale Morphisms and the Relative Cotangent Sequence in Tangent Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of the classes of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, the properties they have, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class of maps appear in algebraic geometry, in differential geometry, in the theory of semirings, and in the theory of Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. We in particular use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category and to give a partial answer of when it is that a submersion admits not just a section but a section which is linear.</description>

      <title>Analytic Uniqueness of Ball Volume Interpolation: Categorical Invariance and Universal Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the classical volume formula for the unit $x$-ball, \[ V_x = \frac{\pi^{x/2}}{\Gamma(x/2+1)}, \] can be characterized as the \emph{unique} analytic continuation of Haar measure normalization and unit ball volumes for $\mathrm{O}(n)$, under principles of categorical invariance and normalization at integer dimensions. We generalize this result to the unitary and symplectic cases, formalize invariance using categorical language, and construct explicit categorical examples with functorial diagrams. This perspective positions $V_x$ and its analogues as canonical analytic objects at the interface of analysis, representation theory, and category theory, and motivates a broader program of exploring categorical invariants for interpolated symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stability and Extension of Steady and Ranging Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a topological data analysis tool that has been widely generalized, extending its scope outside the field of topology. Among its extensions, steady and ranging persistence was developed to study a wide variety of graph properties. Precisely, given a feature of interest on graphs, it is possible to build two types of persistence (steady and ranging persistence) that follow the evolution of the feature along graph filtrations. This study extends steady and ranging persistence to other objects using category theory and investigates the stability of such persistence. In particular, a characterization of the features that induce balanced steady and ranging persistence is provided. The main results of this study are illustrated using a practical implementation for hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Perspective on Braid Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, that is, strict monoidal functors from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. So their classification problems are also equivalent. We consider both the categories $MoonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms are natural transformations and the category $MonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms are the monoidal natural transformations. This categorical contextualisation naturally gives a three-fold focus to the problem: the source $B$; the target $Mat$; and the natural transformations and other symmetries between functors between them. Indeed the approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which $Mat$ is replaced by a certain subcategory. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the solution was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Another is to understand appropriate notions of equivalence - the restriction of target introduces new notions such as that of inner and outer equivalences. And another is to understand how universal such a restricted target is (does it give a transversal of all equivalence classes for a suitable notion of equivalence?). And then the aim is to complete the classification with a suitably universal target.
  With regard to the first part of the triple-focus, the category $B$, we review several features. Work has already been done to generalise to similar categories such as the loop braid category. But a significant part of our input here is to recast $MonFun(B,-)$ as the isomorphic category of Yang-Baxter objects - which manoeuvre leans heavily on the source being $B$ on the nose.</description>

      <title>A simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,1)$-categories were introduced by Lurie, and they have various applications in higher category theory. Abell\'{a}n Garc\'{i}a and Stern gave a generalization to twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories. In this paper we introduce another simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Classification and nonexistence for $t$-structures on derived categories of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes new results on the classification of $t$-structures for many subcategories of the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme. Our work makes progress in two different directions. On one hand, we provide an improvement of a result of Takahashi on $t$-structures, generalizing it to the case of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact CM-excellent scheme of finite Krull dimension. On the other hand, via independent techniques, we prove a variation of a recent result of Neeman which resolved a conjecture of Antieau, Gepner, and Heller.</description>

      <title>Derived preprojective algebras and spherical twist functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study silting objects over derived preprojective algebras of acyclic quivers by giving a direct relationship between silting objects, spherical twist functors and mutations. Especially, for a Dynkin quiver, we establish a bijection between the elements of the braid group and the set of isomorphism classes of basic silting objects over the derived preprojective algebra.</description>
