      <title>Probing the Axion-Electron Coupling with NuSTAR Observations of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for the existence of ultralight axions coupling to electrons and photons using data from the NuSTAR telescope directed toward the galaxies M82, M87, and M31. We focus on electron bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering for axion production in stars, summing over the stellar populations found in the target galaxies when computing the axion luminosity. We then compute the hard X-ray signal that arises from the conversion of these axions to photons in each galaxy's magnetic fields, inferred from analog galaxies in cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Analyzing NuSTAR data toward these galaxies between roughly 20 to 70 keV, we find no evidence for axions and set leading constraints on the combined axion-electron and axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{aee} \times g_{a \gamma \gamma}| \lesssim 8.3 \times 10^{-27}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV at 95% confidence, with M82 providing the most stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Direct Detection with Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering can excite or ionize target molecules in the observatory, which then produce light that can be detected by its photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are undetectable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000 ton scintillator detector, showing that its sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds all other techniques and reaches key particle-theory targets.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>New Supernova Constraints on Neutrinophilic Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova cooling has long been used to constrain physics beyond the Standard Model, typically involving new mediators or dark matter (DM) particles that couple to nucleons or electrons. In this work, we show that the large density of neutrinos inside the neutrinosphere of supernovae also makes them powerful laboratories to study nonstandard neutrino interactions with a {\it neutrinophilic} dark sector, i.e.~DM and mediator particles interacting primarily with neutrinos. In this case, we find that the existing constraints are rather weak, and for a wide range of currently unconstrained parameter space, neutrino annihilation within a supernova could copiously produce such neutrinophilic DM at a large enough rate to cause noticeable anomalous cooling. From the non-observation of such anomalous cooling in SN1987A, we thus set new constraints on neutrino-DM interactions, which provide up to four orders of magnitude improvement over the existing constraints for DM masses below ${\cal O}$(100 MeV).</description>

      <title>Tools for Unbinned Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has enabled differential cross section measurements that are not discretized. Going beyond the traditional histogram-based paradigm, these unbinned unfolding methods are rapidly being integrated into experimental workflows. In order to enable widespread adaptation and standardization, we develop methods, benchmarks, and software for unbinned unfolding. For methodology, we demonstrate the utility of boosted decision trees for unfolding with a relatively small number of high-level features. This complements state-of-the-art deep learning models capable of unfolding the full phase space. To benchmark unbinned unfolding methods, we develop an extension of existing dataset to include acceptance effects, a necessary challenge for real measurements. Additionally, we directly compare binned and unbinned methods using discretized inputs for the latter in order to control for the binning itself. Lastly, we have assembled two software packages for the OmniFold unbinned unfolding method that should serve as the starting point for any future analyses using this technique. One package is based on the widely-used RooUnfold framework and the other is a standalone package available through the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis During an Era of Early SU(2) Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore leptogenesis during a cosmological epoch during which the electroweak $SU(2)_L$ force is confined. During weak confinement, there is only one conserved non-anomalous global charge, $r$, which is a linear combination of lepton-number, baryon-number, and hypercharge. The inclusion of heavy Majorana neutrinos leads to an $r$-charge and $CP$-violating interaction, allowing for the generation of an $r$-charge asymmetry, which translates into a baryon asymmetry post $SU(2)_L$ deconfinement. Determining the resulting baryon asymmetry as a function of the model parameters, we find that the predicted baryon-asymmetry can match observations for a wide swath of parameter space. While leptogenesis under the assumption of a standard cosmology relies on the complex phase of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, the asymmetry generated in this novel background cosmology primarily depends on a strong phase from $SU(2)_L$ confinement and favors negligible $CP$-violation in the right-handed neutrino decays.</description>

      <title>Nice and precise $K^*(892) \to K\pi$ branching fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although discovered more than sixty years ago, direct measurement of the $K^*(892) \to K\pi$ branching fractions is a formidable challenge that has not been attempted. Typically they are assumed to obey the isospin limit in hundreds of particle data measurements. We show that an abundance of recent amplitude analyses and other data, however, enables recovery of the ratios $\mathcal{B}(K^{*+} \to K^+ \pi^0)/\mathcal{B}(K^{*+} \to K_S^0 \pi^+)$ and $4\mathcal{B}(K^{*0} \to K_S^0 \pi^0)/\mathcal{B}(K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-)$ at $\sim 5\%$ precision.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis at LISA: A Fisher analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In JCAP 11 (2024) 051, we discussed how different regimes (flavoured) of leptogenesis can be probed through a ``tomographic'' approach using primordial gravitational waves. By examining the theory's parameter space, we identified regions where right-handed neutrino mass-dependent non-standard cosmological expansion leaves characteristic imprints on propagating gravitational waves. Our analysis focused on inflationary blue-tilted gravitational waves, modeled by a power-law tensor power spectrum with a constant spectral index. The resulting double-peak spectrum -- where peak and dip frequencies are sensitive to leptogenesis parameters -- provided marked signatures of different leptogenesis regimes. In this follow-up article, we conduct a statistical analysis of two-flavour leptogenesis signals, particularly those producing a peak (more generally, a broken power-law signal) within the LISA frequency band. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we delineate the regions of parameter space that LISA can probe with minimal uncertainty, accounting for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds along with LISA's instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-standard interactions and Earth's composition in atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many geophysical and geochemical phenomena in the Earth's interior are related to physical and chemical processes in the outer core and the core-mantle boundary, directly linked to isotopic composition. Determining the composition using standard geophysical methods has been a challenge. The oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, influenced by their weak interactions with terrestrial matter, offer a new way to gather valuable information about the Earth's internal structure and, in particular, to constrain the core composition. If neutrinos had as yet unknown non-standard interactions (NSI), this could affect their propagation in matter and consequently impact studies of Earth's composition using neutrino oscillation tomography. This study focuses on scalar-mediated NSI and their potential impact on atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which could obscure information about the hydrogen content in the outer core. In turn, compositional uncertainties could affect the characterization of NSI parameters. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of the energy distribution and azimuthal angles of neutrino-generated $\mu$ events. Using a model of the Earth consisting of 55 concentric shells with constant densities determined from the PREM, we evaluate the effect on the number of events due to changes in the outer core composition (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and the NSI strength parameter $\epsilon$. To examine the detection capability to observe such variations, we consider regions in the plane of (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and $\epsilon$ where the statistical significance of the discrepancies between the modified Earth model and the reference model is less than $1\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Spin density matrix for neutral $\rho$ mesons in a pion gas in linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spin density matrix for neutral $\rho$ mesons from the spectral function and thermal shear tensor by Kubo formula in the linear response theory, which contributes to the $\gamma$ correlator for the CME search. We derive the spectral function of neutral $\rho$ mesons with $\rho\pi\pi$ and $\rho\rho\pi\pi$ interactions using the Dyson-Schwinger equation. The thermal shear tensor contribution is obtained from the Kubo formula in the linear response theory. We numerically calculate $\rho_{00}-1/3$ and $\mathrm{Re}\rho_{-1,1}$ using the simulation results for the thermal shear tensor by the hydrodynamical model, which are of the order $10^{-3}\sim10^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the spectrum of excited states of the nucleon is vital to our understanding of how QCD is realized in the baryon spectrum. Using a simultaneous analysis of the pion nucleon scattering data up to 2 GeV as well as the results of lattice QCD calculations, we obtain new insight into the nature of the Roper resonance as well as the excited states around 1.9 GeV.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

      <title>Stability of quark matter affected by the surface tension in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface tension of quark matter in a strong magnetic field is investigated using a geometric approach. The interface between the hadronic phase and quark phase is determined by the Maxwell construction of the first-order transition. When surface tension is included, the free energy per baryon is no longer a monotonic function of the chemical potential. Specifically, for smaller droplets, a larger chemical potential is required to achieve a stable phase. Moreover, we find that the surface tension does not increase monotonically with the magnetic field. Finally, it is shown that stable quark matter, both with and without surface tension, can exist at a specific magnetic field strength, which would provide favorable conditions for the experimental production of quark matter.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$-meson photoproduction off the nucleon in a dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoproduction of $J/\psi$ meson off the nucleon is investigated within a dynamical model approach based on a Hamiltonian which describes the reaction mechanisms of the Pomeron exchange, meson exchange, and direct $J/\psi$ radiation terms.To shed light on the low-energy mechanism, we scrutinize the role of light-meson [$\pi^0(135)$, $\eta(548)$, $\eta'(958)$, $f_1(1285)$] and charmonium-meson [$\eta_c(1S)$, $\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $\eta_c(2S)$, $\chi_{c1}(3872)$] exchanges in the $t$-channel diagram. The values of the coupling constants are mostly determined by the radiative decays of the $J/\psi$ meson or the relevant charmonium mesons. The final $J/\psi$-$N$ interaction is required by the unitarity condition and is described by the gluon-exchange and direct $J/\psi N$ coupling terms. The parameters of the Hamiltonian are determined by the latest GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at the Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). We find that $\eta(548)$ and $\eta'(958)$ light mesons give the most significant contribution to $\gamma p \to J/\psi p$ among the meson-exchange terms.Meanwhile, the effect of charmonium mesons turns out to be small compared to that of light mesons.It turns out that the contribution of the FSI term is about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the Born term and is significant near the threshold when the Yukawa form is used as for the charmonium-nucleon potential. The resulting total and $t$-dependent differential cross sections provide good agreement with the JLab data. The angle-dependent data with high precision near the very threshold ($E_\gamma \leqslant 8.9$ GeV) are strongly desired to pin down the role of the FSI term more properly.</description>

      <title>Investigation of box diagrams for the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$ in $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ and $ D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII collaboration recently observed a charged hidden-charm structure with strangeness in the recoil mass spectrum of $K^+$ in the processes $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ or $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$, named as $Z_{cs}(3985)^-$. Within the energy region around the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$, various box diagrams are present. A systematic study of these box diagrams reveals the existence of a box singularity. Dalitz plots and invariant mass distributions of two charmed mesons from the box diagram for the processes $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ and $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$ are presented at five energy points $\sqrt s = 4.628,\,4.641,\,4.661,\,4.681$, and $4.698$ GeV. It is found that these box diagrams can generate peaks similar to those observed in experiments, suggesting that the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$ may be attributed to the box singularity contribution. Additionally, slight differences in the invariant mass spectra of $D^-_s D^{*0}$ and $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$ are identified based on the box diagrams, needing further experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization for the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Sigma_b$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we compute the masses and light-front wave functions of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and its isospin triplet counterparts $\Sigma_b^+$, $\Sigma_b^0$, and $\Sigma_b^-$ using a light-front effective Hamiltonian in the leading Fock sector. These wave functions are obtained as eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian, which incorporates the one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. With the quark masses and the couplings as adjustable parameters, the computed masses are set within the experimental range. The resulting predictions for their electromagnetic properties align well with other theoretical calculations. Additionally, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these baryons are obtained for the first time, with gluon and sea quark distributions dynamically generated through QCD evolution of the valence quark PDFs.</description>

      <title>Decay rates of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \ell^- \bar\nu_\ell$ using helicity analysis and phase-moment parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the helicity method, formulae for the semileptonic transition of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \ell^- \bar \nu_\ell$ including lepton mass effects are derived. In order to calculate the form factors of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon transition matrix element, we employ the phase-moment parameterization and perform fits to the Lattice QCD data. With the help of the obtained form factors, six helicity amplitudes and the differential decay widths are evaluated. Through appropriate angular integrations, we express the helicity flip, helicity nonflip integrated decay rates, and the lepton-side forward-backward asymmetry. We present a numerical analysis of these physical observables. We obtain the mentioned physical quantities by performing fits to the Lattice QCD data using the well-known Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed parametrization. Comparisons with other experimental and theoretical data are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-loop amplitude of $gg\rightarrow HH$ mediated by bottom quarks which provides a correction of percent level at leading order in low invariant mass region. In order to compute the corresponding master integrals, we perform an expansion for the bottom quark mass, using the method of differential equations and fixing the boundary constants by numerical approach. The results of 177 planar master integrals which are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms are provided.</description>

      <title>Exploring the multiplicity dependence of the flavor hierarchy for hadron productions in high energy pp collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic study on the multiplicity dependence of hadron productions at mid-rapidity ($|y|&lt;0.5$), ranging from the light to the charm sector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. This study utilizes a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. We have investigated the baryon to meson ratios as well as the strange to non-strange meson ratios varying with the charged particle density. By tuning the coalescence parameters, the AMPT model provides a reasonable description to the experimental data for inclusive productions of both light and charm hadrons, comparable to the string fragmentation model calculations with color reconnection effects. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative production of hadrons by examining self-normalized particle ratios as a function of the charged hadron density. Our findings suggest that parton evolution effects and the coalescence hadronization process in AMPT model lead to a strong flavor hierarchy in the multiplicity dependence of the baryon to meson ratio. Furthermore, our investigation on the $p_T$ differential double ratio of baryon to meson fraction between high and low multiplicity events indicates distinct modifications to the flavor associated baryon to meson ratio $p_T$ shape in high multiplicity events when comparing the coalescence hadronization model to the color reconnection model. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the hadronization process in high-energy proton-proton collisions through a comprehensive multiplicity dependent multi-flavor analysis.</description>

      <title>Hidden heavy flavor tetraquarks in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is one of the very successful tools for solving the hydrogen atom problem. The experimental discovery of hidden heavy flavor tetraquarks, $Q\bar{Q}q \bar{q}$ ($Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$), provides great possibilities for the hydrogen-bond-like structure of the Quantum Chromodynamics version. In this work, considering that the colors of $Q\bar{Q}$ and $q\bar{q}$ are both 8, the color-spin wave functions of the tetraquark formed by the color coupling $8\otimes8 \rightarrow 1$ are constructed. Then we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to calculate the mass spectra of hidden heavy flavor tetraquarks and evaluate their spatial sizes. The results show that some of the hidden heavy flavor exotic hadrons discovered experimentally can be well explained as this type of hydrogen bond tetraquark structure. In addition, some candidates for tetraquark bound states formed by color-spin interactions are predicted and may be compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium meson spectrum with quenched and unquenched quark models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open question in hadronic phenomenology concerns the ``unquenching" effects of higher Fock space components on the leading Fock space description of hadrons. We address this by making a comparison of the bottomonium spectrum as computed with the relativized Godfrey-Isgur quark model and an unquenched coupled channel model driven by the ``$^3P_0$" mechanism of hadronic decay. Our results show that both models can describe the spectrum well, indicating that the influence of coupled channel effects can be largely absorbed into the parameters of the quenched quark model. This conclusion is reinforced by a perturbative calculation that shows that the spin-dependence of mass splittings due to mixing with the continuum recapitulates quenched quark model spin-dependent interactions. We also show that softening of the quark-antiquark wavefunction due to continuum mixing improves the description of vector bottomonium decay constants. Together, these results illustrate and substantiate the surprising robustness of simple constituent quark model descriptions of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ resummation of photon impact factors and the $\gamma^* \gamma^*$ high energy scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the renormalization group improved collinear resummation of the photon-gluon impact factors. We construct the resummed cross section for virtual photon-photon ($\gamma^*\gamma^*$) scattering which incorporates the impact factors and BFKL gluon Green's function up to the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy in energy. The impact factors include important kinematical effects which are responsible for the most singular poles in Mellin space at next-to-leading order. Further conditions on the resummed cross section are obtained by requiring the consistency with the collinear limits. Our analysis is consistent with previous impact factor calculations at NLO, apart from a new term proportional to $C_F$ that we find for the longitudinal polarization. Finally, we use the resummed cross section to compare with the LEP data on the $\gamma^*\gamma^*$ cross section and with previous calculations. The resummed result is lower than the leading logarithmic approximation but higher than the pure next-to-leading one, and is consistent with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Extracting Transport Properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma from the Heavy-Quark Potential With Neural Networks in a Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we construct a holographic model informed by lattice QCD data. This neural network approach enables the derivation of an analytical solution for the deformation factor $w(r)$ and the determination of a constant $g$ related to the string tension. Within the KANs-based holographic framework, we further analyze heavy quark potentials under finite temperature and chemical potential conditions. Additionally, we calculate the drag force, jet quenching parameter, and diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks in this paper. Our findings demonstrate qualitative consistency with both experimental measurements and established phenomenological model.</description>

      <title>$D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ Dynamics in Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the interactions of the $S$-wave $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ systems within the framework of chiral effective field theory in heavy hadron formalism. We calculate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ effective potentials up to next-to-leading order, explore the bound state formations, and investigate the $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ scattering properties such as scattering rate, scattering length, and effective range. Our results show that all $I=1$ $D^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ potentials are repulsive, preventing the formation of bound states, while the $I=0$ potentials are generally attractive. Specifically, we get two important observations: first, the shallow bound state is more likely to exist in the $D\bar{B}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ system than in the $D\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ system; second, $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(0^{+})]$ and $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})]$ systems possess relatively large binding energies and positive scattering lengths, which suggests strong bound state formations in these channels. So the attractions in the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ systems are deeper than those in the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}[I=0]$ systems, thus we strongly recommend the future experiment to search for the $D^{*}\bar{B}^{*}[I=0]$ tetraquark systems. In addition, we also investigate the dependencies of the $D\bar{B}^{(*)}$ binding energies on the contact low-energy coupling constants (LECs).</description>

      <title>Mass and width of $X(4020)$ in the developed Bethe-Salpeter theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In experiments exotic meson resonance $X(4020)$ lies above the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold, and in principle one can not explain $X(4020)$ as a meson-meson bound state because meson-meson bound state must lie below the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold. In this work, exotic resonance $X(4020)$ is considered as an unstable meson-meson molecular state $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, and the developed Bethe-Salpeter theory for dealing with unstable state is applied to investigate resonance $X(4020)$. We calculate the mass and width of unstable meson-meson molecular state $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory and find that this unstable meson-meson molecular state lies above the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold, which is consistent with experimental values of resonance $X(4020)$.</description>

      <title>Reappraisal of rho meson in nuclear matter by inverse QCD sum rules method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reappraisal of the in-medium properties of the rho meson using the inverse QCD sum rules (QCDSR) formalism, offering a novel, model-independent approach to studying hadronic modifications in nuclear matter. Unlike conventional QCDSR, which rely on a predefined pole+continuum structure, the inverse method reconstructs the spectral function directly from the operator product expansion (OPE), eliminating assumptions about the spectral ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the inverse QCDSR method to the rho meson in nuclear matter. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in the rho meson mass, consistent with previous theoretical predictions, and highlights the crucial role of medium-induced modifications, including condensate suppression and factorization-breaking effects. Furthermore, we assess the sensitivity of our results to the factorization assumption and higher-dimensional condensates, demonstrating the necessity of refining nonperturbative contributions for an accurate description of in-medium hadron properties. Our findings establish the inverse QCDSR method as a robust alternative to conventional spectral analysis techniques, providing a systematically controlled framework for exploring strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These results offer important theoretical benchmarks for lattice QCD simulations and heavy-ion collision experiments, shedding light on the restoration of chiral symmetry and the evolution of hadronic matter in dense environments.</description>

      <title>The self-interaction effects on the Kerr black hole superradiance and their observational implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the black hole (BH) superradiance, ultralight bosons can form dense clouds around rotating Kerr BHs. Certain ultralight bosons, such as axions and axion-like particles (promising dark matter candidates), naturally possess self-interactions, and thus may significantly modify the dynamics of the superradiance process. Previous studies on the detection or constraint of ultralight bosons through superradiance have largely neglected the self-interaction effects of bosons. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of self-interacting boson clouds in the full Kerr spacetime during BH superradiance. Using numerical methods, we compute the superradiant growth rate of boson clouds with self-interactions around Kerr BHs and quantitatively evaluate how the self-interaction strength of scalar bosons affects the growth rate. We also assess the evolution of the BH's mass and spin. Our results reveal that, in addition to the superradiance-imposed upper bound on the boson cloud mass, self-interactions of ultralight bosons introduce a new, lower critical mass limit, beyond which the growth rate of the boson cloud approaches zero. This implies that the superradiance process terminates earlier when self-interactions are considered. Furthermore, we explore how self-interactions affect both the oscillation frequency of boson clouds in gravitational atoms and the frequency of gravitational wave (GW) emitted through cloud annihilation. The anticipated frequency shift could be detectable by the GW observatories. Given that self-interactions substantially alter the evolution of BH superradiance, their effects can significantly relax existing constraints on scalar boson models derived from superradiance. Taking the spin measurements from GW190412 and GW190517 as examples, we discuss the impact of self-interactions on constraint results in details.</description>

      <title>Does thermal leptogenesis in a canonical seesaw rely on initial memory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a common lore that in the thermal leptogenesis in the type-1 seesaw scenario with the conventional hierarchy of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the CP violating, out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest RHN ($N_1$) is the only relevant source of $B-L$ asymmetry. Any asymmetry produced by the heavier RHNs ($N_2$ and $N_3$) gets washed out by the lepton number violating processes mediated by $N_1$. In this paper, we examine this assumption comprehensively, considering decay and inverse decay processes as well as the inclusion of scatterings. We find that the above said assumption is true only if all the RHNs ($N_1, N_2$ and $N_3$) are in strong washout regime. However, we saw that, to satisfy the neutrino masses and mixing given by the low energy neutrino oscillation data, at most one of the RHNs can be in the weak washout regime. This leads to, if $N_1$ is in the weak washout regime, then the washout parameters of $N_2$ and $N_3$ can be chosen in such a way that the impact of $N_2$ and $N_3$ on the final $B-L$ asymmetry is relatively small. On the other hand, if $N_2$ or $N_3$ is in weak washout regime, then the asymmetry produced by them can affect the final $B-L$ asymmetry even if $N_1$ is in the strong washout regime, which we call the memory effect. We delineated the parameter space where the memory effect is significant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to hadron spectroscopy and structure studies using functional methods. We explain the basic features of Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter and Faddeev equations, which are employed to calculate the spectra of mesons, baryons and four-quark states. We discuss dynamical mass generation as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which is intertwined with the emergence of the light pions as Goldstone bosons of QCD. We highlight the importance of diquark correlations in the baryon sector, while for four-quark states such as the light scalar mesons and heavy exotics the dominant two-body clusters are typically mesons. We conclude with a brief discussion of hadron matrix elements like electromagnetic form factors and how vector-meson dominance is an automatic outcome of functional equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported that the observed number of Higgs boson decays into a $Z$ boson and a photon is $\mu = 2.2 \pm 0.7$ times higher than predicted by the Standard Model. Initially, this discrepancy was attributed to a modification of the $HZ\gamma$ vertex. In the $H \to Z\gamma$ process, this decay is reconstructed from $H \to \ell\ell\gamma$, where $\ell$ represents either an electron or a muon. In this study, an investigation is conducted to examine this anomaly by exploring potential additional background contributions to $H \to \ell\ell\gamma$ from various subprocesses within and beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Pion transverse charge density from $e^+$$e^-$ annihilation data and logarithmic dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse charge density of the pion is extracted from a dispersive analysis of the $e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ exclusive annihilation data. A logarithmic dispersion relation is used to compute the unknown phase of the timelike pion form factor from the modulus obtained from the annihilation cross section. The method is model-independent and permits quantitative uncertainty estimates. The density is obtained with few-percent accuracy down to $b \sim 0.1$ fm; at smaller distances it depends qualitatively on the assumed high-energy behavior of the timelike form factor. Implications for pion structure and the relevance of pQCD asymptotics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect enhancement at lower collision energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous holographic studies of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by incorporating a time-dependent magnetic field. Various magnetic field profiles proposed in the literature are implemented, and their impact on the CME signal is analyzed in both static and expanding backgrounds. Interestingly, the integrated chiral magnetic current can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the collision energy. Our results suggest that the CME signal is enhanced at collision energies below $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. In addition, we derive a quasi-equilibrium formula for the chiral magnetic effect in the expanding background that is valid at late times.</description>

      <title>Compact Two-Loop QCD Corrections for $Vjj$ Production in Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present compact two-loop QCD corrections in the leading-color approximation for the production of an electroweak vector boson, $V = \{W^{\pm}, Z,\gamma^\star\}$, in association with two light jets ($Vjj$) at hadron colliders. Leptonic decays of the electroweak boson are included at the amplitude level. Working in the analytic-reconstruction approach, we develop two techniques to build compact partial-fraction forms for individual rational functions. One approach exploits their analytic structure. In the other, we iteratively construct subtraction terms that match the rational functions in singular limits. Moreover, we show how the singular behavior of the rational functions can be systematically used to find a more compact basis of the space that they span. We apply our techniques to the $Vjj$ amplitudes, yielding a representation that is three orders of magnitude smaller than previous results. We then use these compact expressions to provide an efficient and stable C++ numerical implementation suitable for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. These finding can be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to detecting microlensing events and other transients in light curves, utilising the isolation forest (iForest) algorithm for anomaly detection. Focusing on the Legacy Survey of Space and Time by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we show that an iForest trained on signal-less light curves can efficiently identify microlensing events by different types of dark objects and binaries, as well as variable stars. We further show that the iForest has real-time applicability through a drip-feed analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for LSST alert brokers to efficiently prioritise and classify transient candidates for follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Results from an Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using LIGO O2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct two searches for continuous, nearly monochromatic gravitational waves originating from the central compact objects in the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using public LIGO data. The search for Cassiopeia A targets signal frequencies between 20 Hz and 400 Hz; the Vela Jr. search between 400 Hz and 1700 Hz, and both investigate the broadest set of waveforms ever considered with highly sensitive deterministic search methods. Above 1500 Hz the Vela Jr. search is the most sensitive carried out thus far, improving on previous results by over 300\%. Above 976 Hz these results improve on existing ones by 50\%. In all we investigate over $10^{18}$ waveforms, leveraging the computational power donated by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. We perform a 4-stage follow-up on more than 6 million waveforms. None of the considered waveforms survives the follow-up scrutiny, indicating no significate detection candidate. Our null results constrain the maximum amplitude of continuous signals as a function of signal frequency from the targets. The most stringent 90\% confidence upper limit for Cas A is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 7.3\times10^{-26}$ near 200 Hz, and for Vela Jr. it is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 8.9\times10^{-26}$ near 400 Hz. Translated into upper limits on the ellipticity and r-mode amplitude, our results probe physically interesting regions: for example the ellipticity of Vela Jr. is constrained to be smaller than $10^{-7}$ across the frequency band, with a tighter constraint of less than $2\times10^{-8}$ at the highest frequencies.</description>

      <title>$bb\bar u\bar d$ and $bs\bar u\bar d$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}=0.5$, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

      <title>Renormalising the Field-Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Signs of Non-Monotonic Finite-Volume Corrections to $g_A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-volume (FV) corrections to determinations of $g_A$ via lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using analytic results and numerical analysis. We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $50$-$80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. Our results are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference for an evolving dark energy at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest likelihoods $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using Planck 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of a (3+1)D hybrid approach with initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to apply statistical learning, specifically Bayesian inference, to the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid model using initial conditions generated by the SMASH transport code itself, with the objective of constraining model parameters and gaining deeper insight on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependence of both the shear and the bulk viscosity. This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231, and constrain $H_0$ through the distance-sum rule, with minimal cosmological assumptions. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that geometrical optics holds, but we do not need to assume the universe's contents or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. Fixing $\Omega_K=0$, we obtain $H_0=73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0=70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by using the deflector galaxy's mass model and kinematic measurements to break mass-sheet transform, respectively. When $\Omega_K$ is not fixed, the central value of $H_0$ increases further. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, and at the same time, we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration, owing to their higher redshifts. When using 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain a $8.46 \%$ $H_0$ constraint precision, which is better than that from the bright siren GW170817 using the Hubble law by about $40\%$. In the future, as the redshift range of GW dark sirens increases, more and more SGLTDs can be included, and we can achieve high-precision, model-independent measurements of $H_0$ without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$($-11.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.65$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting neutrinos in light of recent CMB and LSS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update constraints on a simple model of self-interacting neutrinos involving a heavy scalar mediator with universal flavor coupling. According to past literature, such a model is allowed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, with some CMB and large-scale structure data even favoring a strongly-interacting neutrino (SI$\nu$) scenario over $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we re-evaluate the constraints on this model in light of the new Planck NPIPE data, DESI BAO data, and the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) applied to BOSS data. We find that Planck NPIPE are more permissive to the SI$\nu$ scenario and that DESI data favor the SI$\nu$ over $\Lambda$CDM. However, when considering EFTofBOSS data, this mode is no longer preferred. Therefore, new DESI data analyzed under the EFTofLSS are particularly awaited to shed light on this disagreement.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the observed violation of isospin symmetry in relativistic nucleus-nucleus reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of isospin symmetry in nucleus-nucleus reactions, as shown in the ratio ${R_K=(K^++K^-)/(K^0+\bar{K}^0)}$ presented by NA61/SHINE, can be understood by introducing results from color-string fragmentation in $e^+e^-$ to nuclear reactions. This novel input allows for a consistent description of the $e^+e^-$ data, proton+proton data and finally nucleus-nucleus data at all investigated energies. We conclude that the observed isospin violation in nucleus-nucleus reactions is explained by asymmetric production of up- and down-quarks in the elementary color field fragmentation process.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a microscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Compton forward scattering singularity in the NCQED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton is a composite particle, so its spin S_P is made from the spins of the partons which the proton consists of. The discrepancy between S_P = 1/2 and the experimentally detected sum of the parton spins was named Proton Spin Puzzle. Solution to this problem includes formulae for the parton helicities valid in the whole range of x. There are approaches in the literature for calculating the helicities. As a theoretical basis they apply different evolution equations. Despite these equations are constructed for operating in widely different regions of x and account for different contributions, all of them equally well suited for solving the proton spin problem. Our explanation of this situation is that the main impact on values of the parton spin contributions should be brought not by the evolution equations themselves but by phenomenological fits for initial parton distributions. We suggest a more theoretically grounded approach to description of the parton helicities and apply it to solving the proton spin problem. It combines the total resummation of double logarithms (DL), accounting for the running coupling effects and DGLAP formulae, leading to expressions for the helicities valid at arbitrary x. As a consequence, the set of involved phenomenological parameters in our approach is minimal and its in uence on the helicity behaviour is weak. We apply our approach to solve the proton spin problem in the straightforward way and make an estimate, demonstrating that the RHIC data complemented by the DL contributions from the regions of x beyond the RHIC scope are well compatible with the value S_P = 1/2.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of $B_s$ to $D_s$ based on the helicity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing dipole and exponential hadronic transition form factors and helicity analysis combined with the Lattice QCD input, we present a detailed study of the decays $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\ell \nu_\ell$. $B_s \to D_s + P(V)$, where $P = \pi^+, K^+, D_s^+$ and $V = \rho^+, K^{*+}, D_s^{*+}$, are also investigated and their branching fractions are examined. At the large recoil point, we calculate $f_{ + ,0}^{{B_s} \to {D_s}}(0) = 0.67 \pm 0.01$ for both parameterizations. Then we evaluate the branching fractions $BR({B_s} \to {D_s}\ell \nu )$ and $BR({B_s} \to {D_s}\ell \nu )$, which leads to $R({D_s}) = 0.298 \pm 0.123$. The ratios $\frac{{\Gamma (B_s^0 \to D_s^ - {\mu ^ + }{\nu _\mu })}}{{\Gamma (B_s^0 \to D_s^{* - }{\mu ^ + }{\nu _\mu })}}$ are found to be $0.4415 \pm 0.1860$ and $0.4406 \pm 0.1854$, which are in good agreement of recent LHCb collaboration measurement. We also calculate the physical observables, $A_{FB}^\ell ,P_L^\ell ,P_T^\ell ,C_F^\ell ,F_L^\ell $.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the production of a baryon pair in $e^+e^-$ annihilation to study the structure of baryons. To study the basic structure of the Standard Model, it is also necessary to consider the baryon-antibaryon pair production at the electron-positron linear collider. The production of a baryon pair in electron-positron annihilation provides a powerful tool at higher center-of-mass energies. In this work, we present phenomenological results for $\Sigma^+ \bar {\Sigma}^-$ production in $e^+e^-$ collision at the BESIII Collider. We investigate a hyperon pair produced in the reaction $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. Two different contributions are considered: the $D$ meson loop and the three-gluon charmonium annihilation loop. Taking into account the contributions of the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon loops and the interference of all diagrams, we calculate the total cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. With respect to a purely electromagnetic mechanism, large relative phases are generated for these contributions. We obtain as a byproduct a fit of the electromagnetic form factor of the $\Sigma$ hyperon for a large momentum transferred region. In this process, in addition to $\psi(3770)$ charmonium, we also take into account the contributions of other charmonium (-like) states, $\psi(4040)$, \,\,$\psi(4160)$, \,\,$Y(4230)$,\,\,$Y(4360)$,\,\,$\psi(4415)$, and $Y(4660)$. The obtained results are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently reported the observation of two new resonances, $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$, which have sparked our interest in studying the light hadron family with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ . In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and OZI-allowed two-body strong decays of $b_1$, $h_1$, and $h_1^\prime$ using the MGI model and QPC model with newly fitted parameters. We also explore the possibility of identifying $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$ as $h_1$ or $h_1^\prime$ states. Our numerical results suggest that $X(1910)$ could be a promising candidate for the $h_1^\prime(2^1P_1)$ state with quark content $s\bar{s}$, while the structure of $X(2300)$ remains uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) in the minimal non-supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT), with a scalar sector comprising a CP-even $45_H$, a $126_H$, and a complex $10_H$. All renormalizable couplings are real due to CP symmetry, and the Kobayashi-Maskawa phase arises solely from complex electroweak vacuum expectation values. The model requires an additional Higgs doublet fine-tuned below 500 GeV and constrains new Yukawa couplings, linking certain flavor-violating (FV) processes. Future proton decay observations may reveal correlated FV decay ratios, offering insights into minimal SO(10).</description>

Abstract: We identify $m_{12}^2$ as a spurion of non-invertible Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the type II 2HDM with gauged quark flavor. Thus a UV theory which introduces quark color-flavor monopoles can naturally realize alignment without decoupling and can furthermore revive the Weinberg-Wilczek axion. As an example we consider the $SU(9)$ theory of color-flavor unification, which needs no new fermions. This is the first model-building use of non-invertible symmetry to find a Dirac natural explanation for a small $\textit{relevant}$ parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the double-virtual amplitudes contributing to the production of a Higgs boson in association with a $b\bar{b}$ pair at the Large Hadron Collider. We perform the computation within the five-flavour scheme, which employs massless bottom quarks and finite bottom-Yukawa coupling, taking into account all the colour structures. We derive the analytic form of the helicity amplitudes through finite-field reconstruction techniques. The analytic expressions have been implemented in a public C++ library, and we demonstrate that evaluations are sufficiently stable and efficient for use in phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of two-loop QCD helicity amplitudes for $gg\to t \bar{t} g$ at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first benchmark evaluation of the two-loop finite remainders for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders in the gluon channel. We work in the leading colour approximation, and perform the numerical evaluation in the physical phase space. To achieve this result, we develop a new method for expressing the master integrals in terms of a (over-complete) basis of special functions that enables the infrared and ultraviolet poles to be cancelled analytically despite the presence of elliptic Feynman integrals. The special function basis makes it manifest that the elliptic functions appear solely in the finite remainder, and can be evaluated numerically through generalised series expansions. The helicity amplitudes are constructed using four dimensional projectors combined with finite-field techniques to perform integration-by-parts reduction, mapping to special functions and Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter.</description>

      <title>Encoding off-shell effects in top pair production in Direct Diffusion networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the precision targets of upcoming LHC runs in the simulation of top pair production events it is essential to also consider off-shell effects. Due to their great computational cost I propose to encode them in neural networks. For that I use a combination of neural networks that take events with approximate off-shell effects and transform them into events that match those obtained with full off-shell calculations. This was shown to work reliably and efficiently at leading order. Here I discuss first steps extending this method to include higher order effects.</description>

      <title>Axion misalignment with memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing axion dark matter (DM) via misalignment mechanisms in a non-standard cosmological era dominated by ultra-light primordial black holes (PBH). While the effect of PBH domination on the production of axion via vacuum misalignment is known assuming the PBH evaporation to proceed according to Hawking's semi-classical (SC) approximation, we go beyond these simplest possibilities to include kinetic misalignment of axion and backreaction effect of emitted particles on the PBH themselves, referred to as the memory-burden (MB) effect. We show that, depending upon the type of misalignment mechanism and PBH evaporation regime, the axion as well as PBH parameter space consistent with the observed DM relic changes significantly having interesting implications for axion detection experiments. PBH also offer complementary detection prospects via gravitational wave due to PBH density fluctuations and excess radiation due to emission of hot axions within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Role of $4S$-$3D$ mixing in explaining the $\omega$-like $Y(2119)$ observed in $e^+e^-\to\rho\pi$ and $\rho(1450)\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration has recently reported a new resonance structure in the cross-section analyses of the $e^+e^- \to \rho\pi$ and $e^+e^- \to \rho(1450)\pi$ processes, displaying characteristics akin to an $\omega$-meson. However, its measured mass, $M = 2119 \pm 11 \pm 15 \, \text{MeV}$, significantly deviates from the predictions of the unquenched relativized potential model for conventional $\omega$ vector meson spectroscopy. To address this discrepancy, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme and investigate the corresponding decay properties within this framework. Our analysis demonstrates that the mixed state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ exhibits excellent agreement with the observed resonance, not only in mass and width but also in the products of its dielectron width and branching ratios, $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho(1450)\pi\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0}$. The determined mixing angle, $\theta = -\left(31.1^{+2.1}_{-3.1}\right)\degree$, strongly supports the interpretation of this structure as the $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ state. Furthermore, we predict dominant decay channels for $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ and its partner state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^{\prime\prime}$. These predictions, together with the proposed mixing mechanism, provide crucial guidance for future experimental studies aimed at probing this structure and rigorously testing the $4S$-$3D$ mixing hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</description>

      <title>Diophantine equations with sum of cubes and cube of sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve Diophantine equations of the type $ a \, (x^3 \!+ \! y^3 \!+ \! z^3 ) = (x \! + \! y \! + \! z)^3$, where $x,y,z$ are integer variables, and the coefficient $a\neq 0$ is rational. We show that there are infinite families of such equations, including those where $a$ is any cube or certain rational fractions, that have nontrivial solutions. There are also infinite families of equations that do not have any nontrivial solution, including those where $1/a = 1- 24/m$ with restrictions on the integer $m$. The equations can be represented by elliptic curves unless $a = 9$ or 1, and any elliptic curve of nonzero $j$-invariant and torsion group $\mathbb{Z}/3k\mathbb{Z}$ for $k = 2,3,4$, or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} $ corresponds to a particular $a$. We prove that for any $a$ the number of nontrivial solutions is at most 3 or is infinite, and for integer $a$ it is either 0 or $\infty$. For $a = 9$, we find the general solution, which depends on two integer parameters. These cubic equations are important in particle physics, because they determine the fermion charges under the $U(1)$ gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of intermediate invariant mass dilepton production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed, using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates with a multistage dynamical approach which includes event-by-event IP-Glasma initial conditions, relativistic viscous fluid dynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. Considering dilepton yield and anisotropic flow, special attention is paid to the out-of-equilibrium aspects, both thermal and chemical, and to the contribution of the Drell-Yan process. The relative contribution of each of those different channels to dilepton observables is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits the decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions) as well as the decay of a zino to a photon and a photino. We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for the homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interaction cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two steps. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>
