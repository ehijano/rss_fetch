      <title>Multi-Wavelength Dust Characterization of the HL Tau Disk and Implications for Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the HL Tau dust disk by modeling its intensity profiles across six wavelengths (0.45 to 7.9 mm) with a resolution of 0.05 arcsec ($\sim7$ au). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain key dust properties including temperature, surface density, maximum grain size, composition, filling factor, and size distribution. The full fitting, with all parameters free, shows a preference for organics-rich dust with a low filling factor in the outer region ($r \gtrsim 40$ au), where the spectral index is $\sim3.7$, but amorphous-carbon-rich dust also reasonably reproduces the observed intensity profiles. Considering the scattering polarization observed at 0.87 mm, compact, amorphous-carbon-rich dust is unlikely, and moderately porous dust is favored. Beyond 40 au, the maximum dust size is likely $\sim100~{\rm \mu m}$ if dust is compact or amorphous-carbon rich. However, if the dust is moderately porous and organics-rich, both the predicted dust surface density and dust size can be sufficiently large for the pebble accretion rate to reach $\sim10M_{\oplus}~{\rm Myr^{-1}}$ in most regions, suggesting that pebble accretion could be a key mechanism for forming planets in the disk. In contrast, if the dust is amorphous-carbon-rich, forming a giant planet core via pebble accretion is unlikely due to the combined effects of low dust surface density and small dust size required to match the observed emission, suggesting other mechanisms, such as disk fragmentation due to gravitational instability, may be responsible for planet formation in the HL Tau disk.</description>

      <title>Wavelength Requirements for Life Detection via Reflected Light Spectroscopy of Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for signs of life is a primary goal of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, merely detecting oxygen, methane, or other widely discussed biosignatures is insufficient evidence for a biosphere. In parallel with biosignature detection, exoplanet life detection additionally requires characterization of the broader physicochemical context to evaluate planetary habitability and the plausibility that life could produce a particular biosignature in a given environment. Life detection further requires that we can confidently rule out photochemical or geological phenomena that can mimic life (i.e. "false positives"). Evaluating false positive scenarios may require different observatory specifications than biosignature detection surveys. Here, we explore the coronagraph requirements for assessing habitability and ruling out known false positive (and false negative) scenarios for oxygen and methane, the two most widely discussed biosignatures for Earth-like exoplanets. We find that broad wavelength coverage ranging from the near UV (0.26 $\mu$m) and extending into the near infrared (1.7 $\mu$m), is necessary for contextualizing biosignatures with HWO. The short wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to identify Proterozoic-like biospheres via O$_3$, whereas the long wavelength cutoff is driven by the need to contextualize O$_2$ and CH$_4$ biosignatures via constraints on C-bearing atmospheric species. The ability to obtain spectra with signal-to-noise ratios of 20-40 across this 0.26-1.7 $\mu$m range (assuming R=7 UV, R=140 VIS, and R=70 NIR) is also required. Without sufficiently broad wavelength coverage, we risk being unprepared to interpret biosignature detections and may ultimately be ill-equipped to confirm the detection of an Earth-like biosphere, which is a driving motivation of HWO..</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Planet Formation from Two Source Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes new dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation. The simulations started at the protoplanetary disk stage, when planetesimals formed and accreted into protoplanets, and continued past the late stage of giant impacts. We explored the effect of different parameters, such as the initial radial distribution of planetesimals and Type-I migration of protoplanets, on the final results. In each case, a thousand simulations were completed to characterize the stochastic nature of the accretion process. In the model best able to satisfy various constraints, Mercury, Venus, and Earth accreted from planetesimals that formed early near the silicate sublimation line near 0.5 au and migrated by disk torques. For Venus and Earth to end up at 0.7-1 au, Type-I migration had to be directed outward, for example as the magnetically driven winds reduced the surface gas density in the inner part of the disk. Mercury was left behind near the original ring location. We suggest that Mars and multiple Mars-sized protoplanets grew from a distinct outer source of planetesimals at 1.5-2 au. While many migrated inwards to accrete onto the proto-Earth, our Mars was the lone survivor. This model explains: (1) the masses and orbits of the terrestrial planets, (2) the chemical composition of the Earth, where ~70% and ~30% come from reduced inner-ring and more-oxidized outer-ring materials, and (3) the isotopic differences of the Earth and Mars. It suggests that the Moon-forming impactor Theia plausibly shared a similar isotopic composition and accretion history with that of the proto-Earth.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: Water Ice in the Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000 angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns, consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma. Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30% 10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.</description>

      <title>Investigation of lunar ejecta dynamics: Particles reaching the near-Earth space and their effect on Earth-based observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Particles ejected from the lunar surface via hypervelocity impacts form a torus between the Earth and the Moon. According to our previous study (Yang et al., A\&amp;A, 659, A120), among them about $2.3\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{kg/s}$ particles impact the Earth after long-term orbital evolution. We mainly focus on these Earth impactors, analyze their orbital element distribution, and estimate their influence on Earth-based observations.
  Methods. In previous work we simulated the long-term orbital evolution of particles ejected from the lunar surface, and obtained their steady-state spatial distribution in the Earth-Moon system. In this work, we analyze the simulation results about the Earth impactors, including the fraction of impactors with different initial parameters among all impactors, the orbital element distribution, and the projection of particles onto several Earth-based observatories.
  Results. Particles ejected from the lunar surface are more likely to impact the Earth within a certain range of initial parameters. Most of these lunar-ejected impactors ($\sim70\%$) reach the Earth within one year, while most of the small ones ($87.2\%$ of $0.2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles and $64.6\%$ of $0.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ particles) reach the Earth within one week. A large proportion of lunar-ejected Earth impactors can be distinguished from interplanetary dust particles according to the differences in their orbital distributions. Besides, lunar-ejected particles may exhibit distinct configurations and orientations from the perspectives of different Earth-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the non-equilibrium chemistry of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for habitable, Earth-like exoplanets faces major observational challenges due to their small size and faint signals. M-dwarf stars offer a promising avenue to detect and study smaller planets, especially sub-Neptunes-among the most common exoplanet types. K2-18 b, a temperate sub-Neptune in an M-dwarf habitable zone, has been observed with HST and JWST, revealing an H2-rich atmosphere with CH4 and possible CO2. Conflicting interpretations highlight the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry, which is critical for constraining atmospheric parameters like metallicity, C/O ratio, and vertical mixing (Kzz). This study explores the parameter space of metallicity, C/O ratio, and Kzz for K2-18 b using the non-equilibrium chemistry model FRECKLL and JWST data. We generated spectra from a 3D grid of models and compared them to observations to refine atmospheric constraints. A fixed pressure-temperature profile was used to capture first-order chemical trends, acknowledging some uncertainties. Our best-fit model favors high metallicity (266^{+291}_{-104} at 2 sigma) and high C/O ratio (C/O &gt; 2.1 at 2 sigma). CH4 is robustly detected (log10[CH4] = -0.3^{+0.1}_{-1.7} at 1 mbar), while CO2 remains uncertain due to spectral noise. Kzz has no clear impact on the fit and remains unconstrained. Non-equilibrium models outperform flat spectra at &gt; 4 sigma confidence, confirming atmospheric features. Minor species, such as H2O and NH3, may be present but are likely masked by dominant absorbers. Our results highlight the limits of constant-abundance retrievals. The atmosphere has a high C/O ratio suggesting possible aerosol formation. Better constraints require higher-precision data. Future JWST NIRSpec G395H and ELT/ANDES observations will be critical for probing habitability and refining models.</description>

      <title>Impact of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites on the China Space Station Telescope Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is projected that more than 100,000 communication satellites will be deployed in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next decade. These LEO satellites (LEOsats) will be captured frequently by the survey camera onboard the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), contaminating sources in the images. As such, it is necessary to assess the impact of LEOsats on CSST survey observations. We use the images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its F814W band to simulate $i$-band images for the CSST. The simulation results indicate that LEOsats at higher altitudes cause more contamination than those at lower altitudes. If 100,000 LEOsats are deployed at altitudes between 550 km and 1200 km with a 53-degree orbital inclination, the fraction of contaminated sources in a 150-s exposure image would remain below 0.50%. For slitless spectroscopic images, the contaminated area is expected to be below 1.50%. After removing the LEOsat trails, the residual photon noise contributes to relative photometric errors that exceed one-tenth of the total error budget in approximately 0.10% of all sources. Our investigation shows that even though LEOsats are unavoidable in CSST observations, they only have a minor impact on samples extracted from the CSST survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.</description>

      <title>3D MHD simulations of planet migration in cavities and inner discs of magnetized stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Type I migration of planets in low-density cavities and inner discs of strongly magnetized young stars using global three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, where the strong magnetic field carves the low-density cavity. Simulations show that a planet in the cavity migrates inwards up to the radius at which the outer Lindblad resonances are inside the cavity. At smaller radii, the migration stalls. The migration is faster if a star accretes in the unstable regime where the temporary tongues penetrate the magnetosphere. If a planet is in a highly inclined orbit, it interacts with the disc, and the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lydov mechanism.
  A planet may stop or reverse its migration in the inner disc before entering the cavity. The magnetosphere interacts with the inner disc, changing its density distribution such that migration slows down or is even reversed. A tilted magnetosphere also excites density and bending waves in the disc, which may slow down migration and also increase the inclination and eccentricity of the planet. When a planet reaches the disc-cavity boundary, it is typically trapped at the boundary by asymmetric corotation torque. A planet moves together with the boundary when the cavity expands. Overall, a magnetized star provides an environment for slow or reverse migration.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the Nature and Orbital Motion of Aristotle's Comet in 372 BC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the investigation of the presumed primordial comet as part of continuing work on a new model of the Kreutz sungrazer system, I confront a previously derived set of orbital elements with Aristotle's remarks in his Meteorologica to test their compatibility and determine the comet's perihelion time. The two translations of the treatise into English that I am familiar with differ at one point substantially from each other. Unambiguously, the year and season of the comet's appearance was early 372 BC (or -371). From Aristotle's constraint on the comet's setting relative to sunset, I infer that the probable date of perihelion passage was January 20, a date also consistent with the vague remark on frosty weather. On the day that Aristotle claims the comet was not seen, its head may have been hidden behind the Sun's disk or in contact with it. The observation that the `comet receded as far as Orion's belt, where it dissolved' is being satisfied by the tested orbit if the perihelion was reached between January 20 and February 10. Aristotle's third statement, which describes the tail as a streak 60 degrees in length, suggests a plasma feature stretching in space over 0.8 AU. The dust tail was developing more gradually and it was all that could be seen from the comet when it was approaching Orion's belt in early April. The comet was seen over a period of more than 10 weeks. The results of this study strengthen the notion that Aristotle's comet indeed was the gigantic progenitor of Kreutz sungrazers.</description>

      <title>The CHEOPS view of HD 95338b: refined transit parameters, and a search for exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ever-increasing number of known exoplanets, no uncontested detections have been made of their satellites, known as exomoons. The quest to find exomoons is at the forefront of exoplanetary sciences. Certain space-born instruments are thought to be suitable for this purpose. We show the progress made with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) in this field using the HD 95338 planetary system. We present a novel methodology as an important step in the quest to find exomoons. We utilize ground-based spectroscopic data in combination with Gaia observations to obtain precise stellar parameters. These are then used as input in the analysis of the planetary transits observed by CHEOPS and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In addition, we search for the signs of satellites primarily in the form of additional transits in the Hill sphere of the eccentric Neptune-sized planet HD 95338b in a sequential approach based on four CHEOPS visits. We also briefly explore the transit timing variations of the planet. We present refined stellar and planetary parameters, narrowing down the uncertainty on the planet-to-star radius ratio by a factor of $10$. We also pin down the ephemeris of HD 95338b. Using injection/retrieval tests, we show that a $5 \sigma$ detection of an exomoon would be possible at $R_{\rm Moon} = 0.8$~$R_\oplus$ with the methodology presented here. We exclude the transit of an exomoon in the system with $R_{\rm Moon} \approx 0.6$~$R_\oplus$ at the $1\sigma$ level. The algorithm used for finding the transit-like event can be used as a baseline for other similar targets, observed by CHEOPS or other missions.</description>

      <title>Prospects of detecting rotational flatness of exoplanets from space-based photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of photometry with space-based telescopes, such as CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExOPlanets Satellite), JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars), and ARIEL (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey), the road has opened for detecting subtle distortions in exoplanet transit light curves -- resulting from their non-spherical shape. We investigate the prospects of retrieval of rotational flatness (oblateness) of exoplanets at various noise levels. We present a novel method for calculating the transit light curves based on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. We compare it in the non-rotating limit to the available analytical models. We conduct injection-and-retrieval tests to assess the precision and accuracy of the retrievable oblateness values. We find that the light curve calculation technique is about $25$\% faster than a well-known analytical counterpart, while still being precise enough. We show that a $3 \sigma$ oblateness detection is possible for a planet orbiting bright enough stars, by exploiting a precise estimate on the stellar density obtained e.g. from asteroseismology. We also show that for noise levels $\geq 256$ ppm (expressed as point-to-point scatter with a $60$~s exposure time) detection of planetary oblateness is not reliable.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Revisiting the GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512 systems and two newly discovered planets orbiting GJ 9773 and GJ 508.2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys for exoplanets indicate that the occurrence rate of gas giant planets orbiting late-type stars in orbits with periods shorter than 1000 days is lower than in the case of Sun-like stars. This is in agreement with planet formation models based on the core or pebble accretion paradigm. The CARMENES exoplanet survey has been conducting radial-velocity observations of several targets that show long-period trends or modulations that are consistent with the presence of giant planets at large orbital separations. We present an analysis of five such systems that were monitored with the CARMENES spectrograph, as well as with the IRD spectrograph. In addition, we used archival data to improve the orbital parameters of the planetary systems. We improve the parameters of three previously known planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512. We also determine the orbital parameters and minimum mass of the planet GJ 3512 c, for which only lower limits had been given previously. Furthermore, we present the discovery of two new giant planets orbiting the stars GJ 9733 and GJ 508.2, although for the second one only lower limits to the orbital properties can be determined. The new planet discoveries add to the short list of known giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity at long orbital periods above 2000 days. These results reveal that giant planets appear to form more frequently in wide orbits than in close-in orbits around low-mass and lower metallicity stars.</description>

      <title>Saturn's G ring: insights from the dynamical evolution of dust particles from the G-ring arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the formation and properties of Saturn's G ring, we study the dynamics of micron-sized dust particles originating from the arc of debris near the inner edge of the ring. The dynamical evolution of particles due to various perturbation forces and the plasma sputtering that erodes the particles is simulated by a well-tested numerical code. Based on the simulation results, the normal $I/F$ of the G ring observed by the Cassini spacecraft can be explained by dust particles originating from the arc. Other properties of the G ring are also estimated, including the steady-state size distribution and the number density of ring particles, the geometric optical depth, the apparent edge-on thickness, the age and the remaining lifetime of the G ring. We find that the particle size distribution of the G ring follows a power law with an exponent of 2.8, and dust particles in the size range of $[5, 10]\,{\mu}$m are dominant within the ring. The average number density of particles of the G ring in the radial direction is about $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The peak value of the edge-on geometric optical depth of the G ring is about $3.9\times10^{-2}$. The maximum apparent edge-on thickness of the G ring with the geometric optical depth larger than $1\times10^{-8}$ is approximately $9,000\,\mathrm{km}$. The age of the G ring is estimated to be $10^{6}$-$10^{7}\,\mathrm{years}$, and the remaining lifetime of the ring is on the order of $10^{4}\,\mathrm{years}$.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of a Spacecraft Flyby with the Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from Earth or Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of a spacecraft mission to conduct a flyby of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on July 1 2025, as it traverses the Solar System. There are both ready-to-launch spacecraft currently in storage on Earth, such as Janus, and spacecraft nearing the end of their missions at Mars. We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast, Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby -- which is more feasible with existing propulsion capabilities. We discuss how existing spacecraft could be used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short notice.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a transiting hot water-world candidate orbiting Ross 176 with TESS and CARMENES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The case of Ross 176 is a late K-type star that hosts a promising water-world candidate planet. The star has a radius of $R_*$=0.569$\pm$0.020$R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $M_{\star}$ = 0.577 $\pm$ 0.024 $M_{\odot}$. We constrained the planetary mass using spectroscopic data from CARMENES, an instrument that has already played a major role in confirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS. We used Gaussian Processes (GP) to improve the analysis because the host star has a relatively strong activity that affects the radial velocity dataset. In addition, we applied a GP to the TESS light curves to reduce the correlated noise in the detrended dataset. The stellar activity indicators show a strong signal that is related to the stellar rotation period of $\sim$ 32 days. This stellar activity signal was also confirmed on the TESS light curves. Ross 176b is an inner hot transiting planet with a low-eccentricity orbit of $e = 0.25 \pm 0.04$, an orbital period of $P \sim 5$ days, and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{eq}\sim 682K$. With a radius of $R_p = 1.84\pm0.08R_{\oplus}$ (4% precision), a mass of $M_p = 4.57^{+0.89}_{-0.93} M_{\oplus}$ (20% precision), and a mean density of $\rho_p = 4.03^{+0.49}_{-0.81} g cm^{-3}$, the composition of Ross 176b might be consistent with a water-world scenario. Moreover, Ross 176b is a promising target for atmospheric characterization, which might lead to more information on the existence, formation and composition of water worlds. This detection increases the sample of planets orbiting K-type stars. This sample is valuable for investigating the valley of planets with small radii around this type of star. This study also shows that the dual detection of space- and ground-based telescopes is efficient for confirm new planets.</description>

      <title>Overcast mornings and clear evenings in hot Jupiter exoplanet atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols is an old topic in the young field of exoplanet atmospheres. Understanding what they are, how they form, and where they go has long provided a fertile playground for theorists. For observers, however, aerosols have been a multi-decade migraine, as their chronic presence hides atmospheric features. For hot Jupiters, the large day-night temperature contrast drives inhomogeneous thermal structures and aerosol distribution, leading to different limb properties probed by transit spectra. We present JWST NIRISS/SOSS spectra of morning and evening limbs for nine gas giants with equilibrium temperatures of ~800-1700 K. By measuring feature size of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band for both limbs, we found three planets (WASP-39 b, WASP-94 Ab, and WASP-17 b) show prominent ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) limb-limb atmospheric opacity difference with muted morning and clear evening limbs. The heavily muted water features on morning limbs indicate high-altitude (0.1 to 0.01 mbar) aerosols. To simultaneously have clear evening limbs requires processes with timescales ($\sim$day) comparable to advection to remove these lofted grains, and we found that both downwelling flow and dayside cloud evaporation could be plausible mechanisms. We hypothesize an empirical boundary--termed the "asymmetry horizon"--in temperature-gravity space that marks the transition where inhomogeneous aerosol coverage begins to emerge. Heterogeneous aerosol coverage is common among hot Jupiters. If unrecognized, limb averaging suppresses spectral features, mimicking high-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres, inflating inferred metallicity by up to 2 dex, and underestimating limb temperatures by as much as half. Finally, we introduce the Limb Spectroscopy Metric (LSM) to predict limb spectral feature size based on planet parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work concerns a detailed review of data analysis methods used for remotely sensed images of large areas of the Earth and of other solid astronomical objects. In detail, it focuses on the problem of inferring the materials that cover the surfaces captured by hyper-spectral images and estimating their abundances and spatial distributions within the region. The most successful and relevant hyper-spectral unmixing methods are reported as well as compared, as an addition to analysing the most recent methodologies. The most important public data-sets in this setting, which are vastly used in the testing and validation of the former, are also systematically explored. Finally, open problems are spotlighted and concrete recommendations for future research are provided.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of dust in the colliding-wind binary Apep revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.</description>

      <title>Evolving magnetic lives of Sun-like stars. I. Characterisation of the large-scale magnetic field with Zeeman-Doppler imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting young, solar-type stars are embedded in a more energetic environment than that of the solar neighbourhood. They experience harsher conditions due to enhanced stellar magnetic activity and wind shaping the secular evolution of a planetary atmosphere. This study is dedicated to the characterisation of the magnetic activity of eleven Sun-like stars, with ages between 0.2 and 6.1 Gyr and rotation periods between 4.6 and 28.7 d. Based on a sub-sample of six stars, we aim to study the large-scale magnetic field, which we then use to simulate the associated stellar wind and environment. Finally, we want to determine the conditions during the early evolution of planetary habitability. We analysed high-resolution spectropolarimetric data collected in 2018 and 2019 with Narval. We computed activity diagnostics from chromospheric lines such as CaII H&amp;K, H$\alpha$, and the CaII infrared triplet, as well as the longitudinal magnetic field from circularly polarised least-squares deconvolution profiles. For six stars exhibiting detectable circular polarisation signals, we reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field at the photospheric level by means of Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). In agreement with previous studies, we found a global decrease in the activity indices and longitudinal field with increasing age and rotation period. The large-scale magnetic field of the six sub-sample stars displays a strength between 1 and 25 G and reveals substantial contributions from different components such as poloidal (40-90 %), toroidal (10-60 %), dipolar (30-80 %), and quadrupolar (10-40 %), with distinct levels of axisymmetry (6-84 %) and short-term variability of the order of months. Ultimately, this implies that exoplanets tend to experience a broad variety of stellar magnetic environments after their formation.</description>

      <title>A deep Search for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolonitrile in the V883 Ori Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.</description>

      <title>A metal-poor atmosphere with a hot interior for a young sub-Neptune progenitor: JWST/NIRSpec transmission spectrum of V1298 Tau b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20 Myr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST and JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a large scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30 sigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our observations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in the 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale height using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me respectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity estimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an atmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low compared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance ([CH4]=-6.2^+0.3_-0.5) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction. To adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a high internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s). These internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary models, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a gas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me, consistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity gradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable metallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its metallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>

Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</description>
