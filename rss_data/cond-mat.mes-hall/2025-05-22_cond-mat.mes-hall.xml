      <title>Activation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization by domain walls in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a N\'eel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the N\'eel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Charge State Controlled Spin-Wave Dynamics in Nanoscale Three-Dimensional Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer a versatile platform for exploring complex spin textures and spin-wave (SW) dynamics, with implications in next-generation spintronic and magnonic technologies. Advances in 3D nanofabrication have allowed a wide-range of structures and phenomena to be realized. Whilst the study of simple cylindrical magnetic nanowires allows the realization of ultrafast domain walls and a spin Cherenkov effect, placing such wires of complex cross-section into 3D arrangements allows one to produce magnetic metamaterials, known as artificial spin-ice (ASI), where the overall ground state and spin dynamics are governed by magnetostatic interactions between elements. Here, using Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) we demonstrate the direct detection of magnetic charged states in a 3D-ASI system. The measured spin-wave modes in 3D-ASI are found to be directly controlled by the local magnetic charge configuration and the direction of the applied magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations provide insight into the spatially selective excitation of spin waves and the evolution of magnetic microstates, uncovering a direct link to the field-dependent characteristics of the spin-wave spectrum. These findings make 3D-ASI architectures a promising system to realize reconfigurable, low-power magnonic devices with engineered collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Silver Electrodeposition from Ag/AgCl Electrodes: Implications for Nanoscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of nanoscience, silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes have become widely utilised in microscale and nanoscale fluidic experiments, because of their stability. However, our findings reveal that the dissolution of AgCl from the electrode in \ch{Cl-}-rich solutions can lead to significant silver contamination, through the formation of silver complexes, \ch{[AgCl_{n+1}]^{n-}}. We demonstrate the electrodeposition of silver particles on graphene in KCl aqueous solution, with AgCl dissolution from the electrode as the sole source of silver. This unexpected electrodeposition process offers a more plausible interpretation of the recently reported ``ionic flow-induced current in graphene''. That is, the measured electronic current in graphene is due to the electrodeposition of silver, challenging the previously claimed ``ionic Coulomb drag''. More caution is called for when using Ag/AgCl electrodes in microfluidic, and especially nanofluidic systems, because AgCl dissolution should not be neglected.</description>

      <title>Fast and high-fidelity transfer of edge states via dynamical control of topological phases and effects of dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability of Au-metal nanosatellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid metallic nanoalloys combining plasmonic and catalytic metals are essential for developing advanced photocatalysts. A promising design called core-satellites comprises a spherical nanogold dotted with smaller transition-metal clusters. While these nanoalloys' catalytic activity and hot-carriers generation have been extensively studied, their morphological stability remains poorly explored. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we highlight the critical role of the transition metal in governing the morphological stability of plasmonic core-satellites. Rh satellites exhibit the highest stability, while only 27\% Pt and 16\% Pd satellites survive after 200 ns at 600K. AuPt and AuPd quickly rearrange into single spherical nanostructures. AuPt forms icosahedra with an Au outer shell due to Au's surface diffusion. AuPd favors FCC and decahedral shapes and shows the highest Au mobility and significant Pd interdiffusion. In contrast, AuRh maintains its original shape, exhibiting a slow surface diffusion of gold onto rhodium and negligible mixing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry may enable the development of quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to correlated topological states. One powerful probe of quantum geometry is the nonlinear Hall response which detects Berry curvature dipole in systems with time-reversal invariance and broken inversion symmetry. With broken time-reversal symmetry, this response is also associated with quantum metric dipole. Here we investigate nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric responses, which provide a wealth of new information about quantum geometry. In particular, we uncover a web of connections between these quantities that parallel the standard Wiedemann-Franz and Mott relations. Implications for the studies of a variety of topological systems, including Weyl-Kondo semimetals and Bernal bilayer graphene, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Readout sweet spots for spin qubits with strong spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit readout schemes often deviate from ideal projective measurements, introducing critical issues that limit quantum computing performance. In this work, we model charge-sensing-based readout for semiconductor spin qubits in double quantum dots, and identify key error mechanisms caused by the back-action of the charge sensor. We quantify how the charge noise of the sensor, residual tunneling, and $g$-tensor modulation degrade readout fidelity, induce a mixed post-measurement state, and cause leakage from the computational subspace. For state-of-the-art systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable $g$-tensors, we identify a readout sweet spot, that is, a special device configuration where readout is closest to projective. Our framework provides a foundation for developing effective readout error mitigation strategies, with broad applications for optimizing readout performance for a variety of charge-sensing techniques, advancing quantum protocols, and improving adaptive circuits for error correction.</description>

      <title>Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</description>

      <title>Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Laser-cooled ions in electromagnetic traps present a pristine and highly controllable, few-body system for examining this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trapping potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a lattice instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. Notably, we observe a triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate tunable Coulomb clusters as a versatile platform to investigate how symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways govern structural transitions in confined few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tailored Vapor Deposition Unlocks Large-Grain, Wafer-Scale Epitaxial Growth of 2D Magnetic CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic materials (2D-MM) are an exciting playground for fundamental research, and for spintronics and quantum sensing. However, their large-grain large-area synthesis using scalable vapour deposition methods is still an unsolved challenge. Here, we develop a tailored approach for centimetre-scale growth of semiconducting 2D-MM CrCl3 films on mica substrate, via physical vapour transport deposition. A controlled synthesis protocol, enabled via innovations concerning light management, very-high carrier-gas flow, precursor flux, and oxygen/moisture removal, is critical for wafer-scale growth. Optical, stoichiometric, structural, and magnetic characterization identify crystalline, phase-pure 2D-MM CrCl3. Substrate temperature tunes thickness of films from few-layers to tens of nanometres. Further, selective-area growth and large-area transfer are demonstrated. Substrate-dependent growth features are explained by density functional theory and state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential-based atomic-scale simulations. This scalable vapour deposition approach can be applied for growth of several 2D-MM, and low growth temperature (~500 C) will enable creation of hybrid heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of the interfacial polarization and negative activation volume for dielectric relaxation in heterogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative activation volumes for dielectric relaxation are rarely reported in solid state physics and are limited to atomic scale processes. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on heterogeneous systems, such as polycrystalline calcite and magnesite, hosting water in their porous spce, detectedintense dielectric relaxation mechanisms related to the interfacial polarization. The characteristic relaxation frequency increased uponhydrostatic compression, indicating that the activation volumes for relaxation are negative. However, a theoretical interpretation for the negative sign of the activation volume is lacking up to date. Within the frame of effective medium approximation for mesoscopic heterogeneous two phase solid - fluid systems, we investigate how the synergyof the pressure depedencies of polarization and electric charge transport, respectively, dictate the pressure dependence of interfacial polarization . predicting the value of the effective activation volume. Our theoretical approach succeeds in predicting the negative sign and magnitude of the activation volume in water saturated polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li-S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic vortex writing and local reversal seeding in artificial spin-vortex ice via all-optical and surface-probe control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin-vortex ice ('ASVI') is a reconfigurable nanomagnetic metamaterial consisting of magnetic nanoislands tailored to support both Ising macrospin and vortex textures. ASVI has recently shown functional applications including reconfigurable magnonics and neuromorphic computing, where the introduction of vortex textures broadens functionality beyond conventional artificial spin ice which generally supports macrospin states. However, local control of writing vortex states in ASVI remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate techniques for field-free magnetic vortex writing in ASVI. We expand ASVI to support metastable macrospin, single-vortex and double-vortex states. All-optical writing via focused laser illumination can locally write double-vortex textures, and surface-probe writing using an MFM tip can locally write single vortex states. We leverage this writing to tailor and explore the reconfigurable energy landscape of ASVI, demonstrating programmable local seeding of avalanche-like reversal events. The global field-free texture selective writing techniques reported here expand the suite of nanomagnetic control techniques, with a host of future applications including fundamental studies of avalanche dynamics, physical memory, and direct writing of nanomagnetic 'weights' in physical neuromorphic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Zero-bias conductance peaks at zero applied magnetic field due to stray fields from integrated micromagnets in hybrid nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many recipes for realizing topological superconductivity rely on broken time-reversal symmetry, which is often attained by applying a substantial external magnetic field. Alternatively, using magnetic materials can offer advantages through low-field operation and design flexibility on the nanoscale. Mechanisms for lifting spin degeneracy include exchange coupling, spin-dependent scattering, spin injection-all requiring direct contact between the bulk or induced superconductor and a magnetic material. Here, we implement locally broken time-reversal symmetry through dipolar coupling from nearby micromagnets to superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. Josephson supercurrent is hysteretic due to micromangets switching. At or around zero external magnetic field, we observe an extended presence of Andreev bound states near zero voltage bias. We also show a zero-bias peak plateau of a non-quantized value. Our findings largely reproduce earlier results where similar effects were presented in the context of topological superconductivity in a homogeneous wire, and attributed to more exotic time-reversal breaking mechanisms [1]. In contrast, our stray field profiles are not designed to create Majorana modes, and our data are compatible with a straightforward interpretation in terms of trivial states in quantum dots. At the same time, the use of micromagnets in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices shows promise for future experiments on topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valleytronics, as an alternative to traditional electronics or spintronics, is based on the encoding of quantum information in pseudospin valley quantum numbers, rather than in charge or spin states. A key ingredient is the (optical) manipulation of valley states before loss of coherence, which can be as fast as 100 femtoseconds. Previous works have shown the possibility of valley state manipulation using external fields. Here we propose uniaxial strain as a more flexible and robust scheme to manipulate the valley state through the breaking of the crystal symmetry and the concomitant lifting of the degeneracy of the 1s exciton energy. Our theory is corroborated by state-of-the-art numerical simulations in monolayer hBN and shows the possibility to control valley pseudospin at the attosecond time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in open long-range Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in a hybrid device consisting of a long-range Kitaev chain coupled to two metallic leads at two ends. Electrical and thermal currents are calculated in this device under both voltage and thermal bias conditions. We find that the transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev chain are distinguishably different from its short-range counterpart, which is well known for hosting zero energy Majorana edge modes under some specific range of values of the model parameters. The emergence of massive Dirac fermions, the absence of gap closing at the topological phase transition point and some special features of the energy spectrum which are unique to the long-range Kitaev chain, significantly alter electrical/thermal current vs. voltage/temperature bias characteristics in comparison with that of the short-range Kitaev chain. These novel transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev model can be helpful in understanding nontrivial topological phases of the long-range Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanics: cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsically multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using previously calculated minimal tight-binding models, and demonstrated analytically on a three-band generalization of the Rice-Mele chain to elucidate the different contributions. We close with comments on further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a new class of chipscale torsion pendula formed by Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions. Owing to their unique hierarchy of gravitational, tensile, and elastic stiffness, the devices exhibit damping rates of $\sim 10\;\mu$Hz and parametric gravity sensitivities near that of an ideal pendulum. The suspension nonlinearity can also be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way towards fully isochronous, high $Q$ pendulum gravimeters. As a demonstration, we study a 0.1 mg, 32 Hz micropendulum with a damping rate of $16\;\mu$Hz, a thermal acceleration sensitivity of $2\;\text{n}g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$. We record Allan deviations as low as 2.5 $\mu$Hz at 100 seconds, corresponding to a bias stability of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also demonstrate a 100-fold cancellation of the pendulum nonlinearity. In addition to inertial sensing, our devices are well suited to proposed searches for new physics exploiting low-loss micro- to milligram-scale mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>Interacting Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Systematic Modeling of Structural Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has drawn significant interest due to recent experiments which show that TBG can exhibit strongly correlated behavior such as the superconducting and correlated insulator phases. Much of the theoretical work on TBG has been based on analysis of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model which includes a phenomenological parameter to account for lattice relaxation. In this work, we use a newly developed continuum model which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. In particular, we model structural relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. We compare the impact of the two relaxation models on the corresponding many-body model by defining an interacting model projected to the flat bands. We perform tests at charge neutrality at both the Hartree-Fock and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) level of theory and find the systematic relaxation model gives quantitative differences from the simplified relaxation model.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>
