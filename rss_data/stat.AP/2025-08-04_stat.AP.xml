      <title>Predicting Formula 1 Race Outcomes: Decomposing the Roles of Drivers and Constructors through Linear Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formula 1 performance is a combination of the car's ability and the driver's ability. While a given race or season can tell you how well a car and driver performed jointly, isolating the individual impact of the driver and constructor remains challenging. This paper extends a Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus (RAPM) methodology (Sill 2010), commonly used in basketball and hockey, to parse out individual driver and constructor impact. It employs a time-decayed ridge regression with LOESS (Jacoby 2000) smoothing to predict race results for the Hybrid Engine Era (2014 - 2024). By measuring the constructor and driver coefficients over time, we measure the relative individual impact of driver and constructor throughout the period. Results show that constructors explain 64.0% of the variance in race outcomes in the Hybrid Engine Era. Additionally, constructors have increased importance in benchmarked rank-agnostic cohorts (e.g., Top 10 points finishers) and decreased importance in qualifying. By decomposing performance into individual driver and constructor metrics, we create a robust framework for inter-constructor driver comparisons that the Formula 1 points system obfuscates. Our work enhances the understanding of driver and constructor contributions to race success, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making in Formula 1.</description>

      <title>Regime-Aware Conditional Neural Processes with Multi-Criteria Decision Support for Operational Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.</description>

      <title>New Pilot-Study Design in Functional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data collection is essential in applied studies where frequent measurements are costly, time-consuming, or burdensome. This challenge is especially pronounced in functional data settings, where each subject is observed at only a few time points due to practical constraints. Most existing design approaches focus on selecting optimal time points for individual subjects, typically relying on model parameters estimated from a pilot study. However, the design of the pilot study itself has received limited attention. We propose a framework for constructing pilot-study designs that support both accurate trajectory recovery and effective planning of future designs. A search algorithm is developed to generate such high-quality pilot-study designs. Simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate that our approach outperforms commonly used alternatives, highlighting its value in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Toward using explainable data-driven surrogate models for treating performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem. The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models (e.g., R2&gt; 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables, consistent with engineering principles.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Space-Time Dynamic Model for Characterizing the Atmospheric Impacts Following the Mt Pinatubo Eruptio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The June 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption resulted in a massive increase of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, absorbing radiation and leading to global changes in surface and stratospheric temperatures. A volcanic eruption of this magnitude serves as a natural analog for stratospheric aerosol injection, a proposed solar radiation modification method to combat a warming climate. The impacts of such an event are multifaceted and region-specific. Our goal is to characterize the multivariate and dynamic nature of the atmospheric impacts following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We developed a multivariate space-time dynamic linear model to understand the full extent of the spatially- and temporally-varying impacts. Specifically, spatial variation is modeled using a flexible set of basis functions for which the basis coefficients are allowed to vary in time through a vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. This novel model is caste in a Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) framework and estimated via a customized MCMC approach. We demonstrate how the model quantifies the relationships between key atmospheric parameters prior to and following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption with reanalysis data from MERRA-2 and highlight when such model is advantageous over univariate models.</description>

      <title>Assessing Racial Disparities in Healthcare Expenditures via Mediator Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Racial disparities in healthcare expenditures are well-documented, yet the underlying drivers remain complex and require further investigation. This study develops a framework for decomposing such disparities through shifts in the distributions of mediating variables, rather than treating race itself as a manipulable exposure. We define disparities as differences in covariate-adjusted outcome distributions across racial groups, and decompose the total disparity into two components: one attributable to differences in mediator distributions, and another residual component that would remain even after equalizing these distributions. Using data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, we examine the extent to which expenditure disparities would persist or be reduced if mediators such as socioeconomic status, insurance access, health behaviors, or health status were equalized across racial groups. To ensure valid inference, we derive asymptotically linear estimators based on influence-function techniques and flexible machine learning tools, including super learners and a two-part model designed for the zero-inflated, right-skewed nature of expenditure data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian CART models for aggregate claim modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes three types of Bayesian CART (or BCART) models for aggregate claim amount, namely, frequency-severity models, sequential models and joint models. We propose a general framework for the BCART models applicable to data with multivariate responses, which is particularly useful for the joint BCART models with a bivariate response: the number of claims and aggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we investigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity data by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution is superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture different tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that sequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence between the number of claims and average severity, are beneficial and thus preferable to the frequency-severity BCART models in which independence is assumed. The effectiveness of these models' performance is illustrated by carefully designed simulations and real insurance data.</description>

      <title>Curious Causality-Seeking Agents Learn Meta Causal World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.</description>
