      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process, under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that the random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. In the process of developing our results for the random forest, we also establish a probabilistic result, which might be of independent interest, on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Kernel Density Estimation on Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that kernel density estimation on symmetric spaces of non-compact type, whose L2-risk was bounded above in previous work (Asta,2021), in fact achieves a minimax rate of convergence. With this result, the story for kernel density estimation on all symmetric spaces is completed. The idea in adapting the proof for Euclidean space is to suitably abstract vector space operations on Euclidean space to both actions of symmetric groups and reparametrizations of Helgason-Fourier transforms and to use the fact that the exponential map for symmetric spaces of non-compact type defines a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Distributional Input Uncertainty via Inflated Kolmogorov-Smirnov Confidence Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic simulation, input uncertainty refers to the propagation of the statistical noise in calibrating input models to impact output accuracy, in addition to the Monte Carlo simulation noise. The vast majority of the input uncertainty literature focuses on estimating target output quantities that are real-valued. However, outputs of simulation models are random and real-valued targets essentially serve only as summary statistics. To provide a more holistic assessment, we study the input uncertainty problem from a distributional view, namely we construct confidence bands for the entire output distribution function. Our approach utilizes a novel test statistic whose asymptotic consists of the supremum of the sum of a Brownian bridge and a suitable mean-zero Gaussian process, which generalizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to account for input uncertainty. Regarding implementation, we also demonstrate how to use subsampling to efficiently estimate the covariance function of the Gaussian process, thereby leading to an implementable estimation of the quantile of the test statistic and a statistically valid confidence band. Numerical results demonstrate how our new confidence bands provide valid coverage for output distributions under input uncertainty that is not achievable by conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Goodness-of-Fit for Conditional Distributions: An Approach Using Principal Component Analysis and Component Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel goodness-of-fit test technique for parametric conditional distributions. The proposed tests are based on a residual marked empirical process, for which we develop a conditional Principal Component Analysis. The obtained components provide a basis for various types of new tests in addition to the omnibus one. Component tests that based on each component serve as experts in detecting certain directions. Smooth tests that assemble a few components are also of great use in practice. To further improve testing efficiency, we introduce a component selection approach, aiming to identify the most contributory components. The finite sample performance of the proposed tests is illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust Sparse Estimation for Gaussians with Optimal Error under Huber Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaussian sparse estimation tasks in Huber's contamination model with a focus on mean estimation, PCA, and linear regression. For each of these tasks, we give the first sample and computationally efficient robust estimators with optimal error guarantees, within constant factors. All prior efficient algorithms for these tasks incur quantitatively suboptimal error. Concretely, for Gaussian robust $k$-sparse mean estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with corruption rate $\epsilon&gt;0$, our algorithm has sample complexity $(k^2/\epsilon^2)\mathrm{polylog}(d/\epsilon)$, runs in sample polynomial time, and approximates the target mean within $\ell_2$-error $O(\epsilon)$. Previous efficient algorithms inherently incur error $\Omega(\epsilon \sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$. At the technical level, we develop a novel multidimensional filtering method in the sparse regime that may find other applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic Debiased Machine Learning via Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of interesting parameters may depend on high dimensional regressions. Machine learning can be used to estimate such parameters. However estimators based on machine learners can be severely biased by regularization and/or model selection. Debiased machine learning uses Neyman orthogonal estimating equations to reduce such biases. Debiased machine learning generally requires estimation of unknown Riesz representers. A primary innovation of this paper is to provide Riesz regression estimators of Riesz representers that depend on the parameter of interest, rather than explicit formulae, and that can employ any machine learner, including neural nets and random forests. End-to-end algorithms emerge where the researcher chooses the parameter of interest and the machine learner and the debiasing follows automatically. Another innovation here is debiased machine learners of parameters depending on generalized regressions, including high-dimensional generalized linear models. An empirical example of automatic debiased machine learning using neural nets is given. We find in Monte Carlo examples that automatic debiasing sometimes performs better than debiasing via inverse propensity scores and never worse. Finite sample mean square error bounds for Riesz regression estimators and asymptotic theory are also given.</description>

      <title>MARS via LASSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a popular method for nonparametric regression introduced by Friedman in 1991. MARS fits simple nonlinear and non-additive functions to regression data. We propose and study a natural lasso variant of the MARS method. Our method is based on least squares estimation over a convex class of functions obtained by considering infinite-dimensional linear combinations of functions in the MARS basis and imposing a variation based complexity constraint. Our estimator can be computed via finite-dimensional convex optimization, although it is defined as a solution to an infinite-dimensional optimization problem. Under a few standard design assumptions, we prove that our estimator achieves a rate of convergence that depends only logarithmically on dimension and thus avoids the usual curse of dimensionality to some extent. We also show that our method is naturally connected to nonparametric estimation techniques based on smoothness constraints. We implement our method with a cross-validation scheme for the selection of the involved tuning parameter and compare it to the usual MARS method in various simulation and real data settings.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Exchangeable Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a complexity measure for exchangeable graphs by considering the graph-generating mechanism. Exchangeability for graphs implies distributional invariance under node permutations, making it a suitable default model for a wide range of graph data. For this well-studied class of graphs, we quantify complexity using graphon entropy. Graphon entropy is a graph property, meaning it is invariant under graph isomorphisms. Therefore, we focus on estimating the entropy of the generating mechanism for a graph realization, rather than selecting a specific graph feature. This approach allows us to consider the global properties of a graph, capturing its important graph-theoretic and topological characteristics, such as sparsity, symmetry, and connectedness. We introduce a consistent graphon entropy estimator that achieves the nonparametric rate for any arbitrary exchangeable graph with a smooth graphon representative. Additionally, we develop tailored entropy estimators for situations where more information about the underlying graphon is available, specifically for widely studied random graph models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Configuration Model and Stochastic Block Model. We determine their large-sample properties by providing a Central Limit Theorem for the first two, and a convergence rate for the third model. We also conduct a simulation study to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the connection between graphon entropy and graph structure. Finally, we investigate the role of our entropy estimator as a complexity measure for characterizing real-world graphs.</description>

      <title>Double Descent and Overfitting under Noisy Inputs and Distribution Shift for Linear Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the importance of denoising in modern machine learning and ample empirical work on supervised denoising, its theoretical understanding is still relatively scarce. One concern about studying supervised denoising is that one might not always have noiseless training data from the test distribution. It is more reasonable to have access to noiseless training data from a different dataset than the test dataset. Motivated by this, we study supervised denoising and noisy-input regression under distribution shift. We add three considerations to increase the applicability of our theoretical insights to real-life data and modern machine learning. First, while most past theoretical work assumes that the data covariance matrix is full-rank and well-conditioned, empirical studies have shown that real-life data is approximately low-rank. Thus, we assume that our data matrices are low-rank. Second, we drop independence assumptions on our data. Third, the rise in computational power and dimensionality of data have made it important to study non-classical regimes of learning. Thus, we work in the non-classical proportional regime, where data dimension $d$ and number of samples $N$ grow as $d/N = c + o(1)$.
  For this setting, we derive data-dependent, instance specific expressions for the test error for both denoising and noisy-input regression, and study when overfitting the noise is benign, tempered or catastrophic. We show that the test error exhibits double descent under general distribution shift, providing insights for data augmentation and the role of noise as an implicit regularizer. We also perform experiments using real-life data, where we match the theoretical predictions with under 1\% MSE error for low-rank data.</description>
