      <title>Guiding LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation with Mobility Measures from Shared Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for many science domains such as urban science, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility trajectories by modeling individual-level cognitive processes. However, these approaches generate individual mobility trajectories independently, without any population-level coordination mechanism, and thus fail to capture the emergence of collective behaviors. To address this issue, we design M2LSimu, a mobility measures-guided multi-prompt adjustment framework that leverages mobility measures derived from shared data as guidance to refine individual-level prompts for realistic mobility generation. Our framework applies coarse-grained adjustment strategies guided by mobility measures, progressively enabling fine-grained individual-level adaptation while satisfying multiple population-level mobility objectives under a limited budget. Experiments show that M2LSimu significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on two public datasets.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Network for Industrial IoT Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial IoT predictive maintenance requires systems capable of real-time anomaly detection without sacrificing interpretability or demanding excessive computational resources. Traditional approaches rely on static, offline-trained models that cannot adapt to evolving operational conditions, while LLM-based monolithic systems demand prohibitive memory and latency, rendering them impractical for on-site edge deployment. We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference. The framework incorporates LLM-based response generation for explainability and federated knowledge aggregation for adaptive policy distribution. This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirm that PPO-driven policy evolution, consensus voting, and federated aggregation each contribute materially to system effectiveness. These findings indicate that resource-aware, self-evolving 1multi-agent coordination is essential for production-ready industrial IoT predictive maintenance under strict latency and explainability constraints.</description>

      <title>AdaptOrch: Task-Adaptive Multi-Agent Orchestration in the Era of LLM Performance Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models from diverse providers converge toward comparable benchmark performance, the traditional paradigm of selecting a single best model per task yields diminishing returns. We argue that orchestration topology -- the structural composition of how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized -- now dominates system-level performance over individual model capability. We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models. Our results establish orchestration design as a first-class optimization target independent of model scaling.</description>

      <title>Safe Continuous-time Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Epigraph Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most algorithms still rely on a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed decision intervals. This formulation is often ill-suited for complex multi-agent dynamics, particularly in high-frequency or irregular time-interval settings, leading to degraded performance and motivating the development of continuous-time MARL (CT-MARL). Existing CT-MARL methods are mainly built on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. However, they rarely account for safety constraints such as collision penalties, since these introduce discontinuities that make HJB-based learning difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a continuous-time constrained MDP (CT-CMDP) formulation and a novel MARL framework that transforms discrete MDPs into CT-CMDPs via an epigraph-based reformulation. We then solve this by proposing a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based actor-critic method that enables stable and efficient optimization in continuous time. We evaluate our approach on continuous-time safe multi-particle environments (MPE) and safe multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks. Results demonstrate smoother value approximations, more stable training, and improved performance over safe MARL baselines, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our method.</description>

      <title>AgentConductor: Topology Evolution for Multi-Agent Competition-Level Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model(LLM)-driven multi-agent systems(MAS) coordinate specialized agents through predefined interaction topologies and have shown promise for complex tasks such as competition-level code generation. Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion at Test Time: A Meta-game Design and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threat of algorithmic collusion, and whether it merits regulatory intervention, remains debated, as existing evaluations of its emergence often rely on long learning horizons, assumptions about counterparty rationality in adopting collusive strategies, and symmetry in hyperparameters and economic settings among players. To study collusion risk, we introduce a meta-game design for analyzing algorithmic behavior under test-time constraints. We model agents as possessing pretrained policies with distinct strategic characteristics (e.g., competitive, naively cooperative, robustly collusive), and formulate the problem as selecting a meta-strategy that combines a pretrained, initial policy with an in-game adaptation rule. We seek to examine whether collusion can emerge under rational choices and how agents co-adapt toward cooperation or competition. To this end, we sample normal-form empirical games over meta-strategy profiles, % across random initial game states, compute relevant game statistics (e.g., payoffs against individuals and regret against an equilibrium mixture of opponents), and construct empirical best-response graphs to uncover strategic relationships. We evaluate both reinforcement-learning and LLM-based strategies in repeated pricing games under symmetric and asymmetric cost settings, and present findings on the feasibility of algorithmic collusion and the effectiveness of pricing strategies in practical ``test-time'' environments.

      <title>Discovering Multiagent Learning Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Planning via Penalty Functions and Block-Coordinate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent planning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is often hindered by collaborative tasks that lead to computational challenges due to the inherent high-dimensionality of the problem, preventing scalable synthesis with satisfaction guarantees. To address this, we formulate STL planning as an optimization program under arbitrary multi-agent constraints and introduce a penalty-based unconstrained relaxation that can be efficiently solved via a Block-Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) method, where each block corresponds to a single agent's decision variables, thereby mitigating complexity. By utilizing a quadratic penalty function defined via smooth STL semantics, we show that BCGD iterations converge to a stationary point of the penalized problem under standard regularity assumptions. To enforce feasibility, the BCGD solver is embedded within a two-layer optimization scheme: inner BCGD updates are performed for a fixed penalty parameter, which is then increased in an outer loop to progressively improve multi-agent STL robustness. The proposed framework enables scalable computations and is validated through various complex multi-robot planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence in Games with Delayed Feedback via Extra Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-\Theta(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-\Theta(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decentralized Composite Optimization via Three-Operator Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies decentralized optimization over networks, where agents minimize a sum of {\it locally} smooth (strongly) convex losses and plus a nonsmooth convex extended value term. We propose decentralized methods wherein agents {\it adaptively} adjust their stepsize via local backtracking procedures coupled with lightweight min-consensus protocols. Our design stems from a three-operator splitting factorization applied to an equivalent reformulation of the problem. The reformulation is endowed with a new BCV preconditioning metric (Bertsekas-O'Connor-Vandenberghe), which enables efficient decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments. We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive stepsize strategy.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Multi-Agent Learning with Adversarial Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study robustness to agent malfunctions in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), a failure mode that is critical in practice yet underexplored in existing theory. We introduce MARTA, a plug-and-play robustness layer that augments standard MARL algorithms with a Switcher-Adversary mechanism which selectively induces malfunctions in performance-critical states. This formulation defines a fault-switching $(N+2)$-player Markov game in which the Switcher chooses when and which agent fails, and the Adversary controls the resulting faulty behaviour via random or worst-case policies. We develop a Q-learning-type scheme and show that the associated Bellman operator is a contraction, yielding existence and uniqueness of the minimax value, convergence to a Markov perfect equilibrium. MARTA integrates seamlessly with MARL algorithms without architectural modification and consistently improves robustness across Traffic Junction (TJ), Level-Based Foraging (LBF), MPE SimpleTag, and SMAC (v2). In these domains, MARTA achieves large gains in final performance of up to 116.7\% in SMAC, 21.4\% in MPE SimpleTag, and 44.6\% in LBF, while significantly reducing failure rates under train-test mismatched fault regimes. These results establish MARTA as a theoretically grounded and practically deployable mechanism for fault-tolerant MARL.</description>

      <title>Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\"ive solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.</description>

      <title>Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auction is applied for trade with various mechanisms. A simple but practical question is which mechanism, typically first-price or second-price auctions, is preferred from the perspective of bidders or sellers. A celebrated answer is revenue equivalence, where each bidder's equilibrium payoff is proven to be independent of auction mechanisms (and a seller's revenue, too). In reality, however, auction environments like the value distribution of items would vary over time, and such equilibrium bidding cannot always be achieved. Indeed, bidders must continue to track their equilibrium bidding by learning in first-price auctions, but they can keep their equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. This study discusses whether and how revenue equivalence is violated in the long run by comparing the time series of non-equilibrium bidding in first-price auctions with those of equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. We characterize the value distribution by two parameters: its basis value, which means the lowest price to bid, and its value interval, which means the width of possible values. Surprisingly, our theorems and experiments find that revenue equivalence is broken by the correlation between the basis value and the value interval, uncovering a novel phenomenon that could occur in the real world.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135</link>

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional data processing pipelines are typically static and handcrafted for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability to evolving requirements. While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zpforlove/Resp-Agent.</description>

      <title>Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.
  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.
  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</description>
