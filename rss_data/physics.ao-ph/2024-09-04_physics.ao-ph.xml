      <title>Cartographie du confort thermique au sein d'une cours d'{\'e}cole parisienne : couplage de mesures microclimatiques fixes et mobiles</title>

Abstract: Climate change will result in more frequent, more intense and longer-lasting heat waves by 2050. As part of its Climate Plan and its resilience strategy, the City of Paris is deploying, through its Oasis program, a network of urban cool islands to mitigate the urban heat island phenomena: schoolyards are renovated in order to reduce the heat stress of users. We establish a methodology aiming to quantify the microclimatic impact of the transformation. Mobile measurements are carried out within a case courtyard under hot conditions and coupled with fixed weather station data to evaluate heat stress using UTCI. The heat stress mapping thus obtained allows a first microclimatic diagnosis of the schoolyard.</description>

      <title>Over 100-fold improvement in the accuracy of relaxed eddy accumulation flux estimates through error diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of atmosphere-surface exchange are largely limited by the availability of fast-response gas analyzers; this limitation hampers our understanding of the role of terrestrial ecosystems in atmospheric chemistry and global change. Current micrometeorological methods, compatible with slow-response gas analyzers, are difficult to implement, or rely on empirical parameters that introduce large systematic errors. Here, we develop a new micrometeorological method, optimized for slow-response gas analyzers, that directly measures exchange rates of different atmospheric constituents, with minimal requirements. The new method requires only the sampling of air at a constant rate and directing it into one of two reservoirs, depending on the direction of the vertical wind velocity. An integral component of the new technique is an error diffusion algorithm that minimizes the biases in the measured fluxes and achieves direct flux estimates. We demonstrate that the new method provides an unbiased estimate of the flux, with accuracy within 0.1 of the reference eddy covariance flux, and importantly, allows for significant enhancements in the signal-to-noise ratio of measured scalars without compromising accuracy. Our new method provides a simple and reliable way to address complex environmental questions and offers a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of ecological systems and atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling on Terahertz Channels in Rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Terahertz (THz) frequency band offers a wide range of bandwidths, from tens to hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) and also supports data speeds of several terabits per second (Tbps). Because of this, maintaining THz channel reliability and efficiency in adverse weather conditions is crucial. Rain, in particular, disrupts THz channel propagation significantly and there is still lack of comprehensive investigations due to the involved experimental difficulties. This work explores how rain affects THz channel performance by conducting experiments in a rain emulation chamber and under actual rainy conditions outdoors. We focus on variables like rain intensity, raindrop size distribution (RDSD), and the channel's gradient height. We observe that the gradient height (for air-to-ground channel) can induce changes of the RDSD along the channel's path, impacting the precision of modeling efforts. To address this, we propose a theoretical model, integrating Mie scattering theory with considerations of channel's gradient height. Both our experimental and theoretical findings confirm this model's effectiveness in predicting THz channel behavior in rainy conditions. This work underscores the necessary in incorporating the variation of RDSD when THz channel travels in scenarios involving ground-to-air or air-to-ground communications.</description>

      <title>Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods, and their applications in Earth Science. More specifically, the paper presents an overview of causal discovery and causal inference, explains the underlying causal assumptions, and enlists evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the domain area. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth Science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections etc. This survey paper can serve as a primer for Data Science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a list of resources, such as Earth Science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis. It will equally benefit the Earth Science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth Science study.</description>

      <title>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</description>

      <title>Unicorn: U-Net for Sea Ice Forecasting with Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea ice at the North Pole is vital to global climate dynamics. However, accurately forecasting sea ice poses a significant challenge due to the intricate interaction among multiple variables. Leveraging the capability to integrate multiple inputs and powerful performances seamlessly, many studies have turned to neural networks for sea ice forecasting. This paper introduces a novel deep architecture named Unicorn, designed to forecast weekly sea ice. Our model integrates multiple time series images within its architecture to enhance its forecasting performance. Moreover, we incorporate a bottleneck layer within the U-Net architecture, serving as neural ordinary differential equations with convolution operations, to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of latent variables. Through real data analysis with datasets spanning from 1998 to 2021, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in the sea ice concentration forecasting task. It achieves an average MAE improvement of 12% compared to benchmark models. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches in sea ice extent forecasting, achieving a classification performance improvement of approximately 18%. These experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Extending the blended generalized extreme value distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is commonly employed to help estimate the likelihood of extreme events in many geophysical and other application areas. The recently proposed blended generalized extreme value (bGEV) distribution modifies the GEV with positive shape parameter to avoid a hard lower bound that complicates fitting and inference. Here, the bGEV is extended to the GEV with negative shape parameter, avoiding a hard upper bound that is unrealistic in many applications. This extended bGEV is shown to improve on the GEV for forecasting heat and sea level extremes based on past data. Software implementing this bGEV and applying it to the example temperature and sea level data is provided.</description>
