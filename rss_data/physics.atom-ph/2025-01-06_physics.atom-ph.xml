      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Lindblad dynamics via time-rescaling engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal method for accelerating Lindblad dynamics that preserves the original trajectory. The technique provides exact fast processes analytically, which are Markovian with time-independent Lindblad operators, by time-rescaling a reference dynamics. In particular, the engineered control protocols are based only on local interactions, and no additional control fields are required compared to the reference protocol. We demonstrate the scheme with two examples: a driven two-level system in an amplitude damping channel and the dissipative transverse field Ising model. Our approach can help advance techniques for quantum control and computation towards more complex noisy systems.</description>

      <title>780 nm Compact Optical Clock Down-Conversion for Microwave Frequencies with $10^{-14}$ instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated a compact rubidium optical clock, which includes an optical frequency standard and an optical frequency comb, with an optical path volume of merely 11.6 liters. The laser frequency is stabilized to the hyperfine transitions of the rubidium D2 line using modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS), which eliminites Doppler background and provides a high signal to noise ratio and high sensitivity. A 300 MHz microwave signal, whose phase exactly tracks that of the optical frequency standard (OFC), is generated via the optical frequency comb, yielding a frequency instability of 1.89 E-13@1 s and 5.27 E-14@1000 s in the electronic domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optical clock at Rb D2 line. These results offer a promising approach for the development of portable optical clock.</description>

      <title>Multiple ionization, fragmentation and dehydrogenation of coronene in collision with swift proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coronene molecules have been bombarded by protons of energy by 75 to 300 keV. The time of flight mass spectrum has been recorded using a two stage Wiley McLaren type spectrometer. A large enhancement in the doubly and triply ionized recoil ion is observed compared to the singly ionized one. The single, double and triple ionization yields have also been calculated using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW EIS) theoretical model and are compared with the experimental results. Experimental double to single ionization yield ratios and triple to single ionization yield ratios have been compared with the theoretical ratios which are found to be much higher w.r. t. the gas atoms. Evaporation peaks due to the loss of several neutral C2H2 and C3H3 are observed corresponding to their parent singly, doubly and triply charge coronene ions. Small fragmentation peaks CnHx+ (n = 3 to 7) are present in the spectra due to higher energy transfer by the projectile to the molecule. The hydrogen losses are observed in the cation, di-cation and tri-cation coronene peak structures. A maximum of the 7 H losses are detected which depends on the beam energy.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>
