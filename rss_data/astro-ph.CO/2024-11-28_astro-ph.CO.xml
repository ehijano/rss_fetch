      <title>Signatures of warm dark matter in the cosmological density fields extracted using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to construct a machine-learning approach that allows for a pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) density field for various warm dark matter (WDM) models using the Lyman-alpha forest. With this regression machinery, we constrain the mass of a potential WDM particle from observed Lyman-alpha sightlines directly from the density field. We design and train a Bayesian neural network on the supervised regression task of recovering the optical depth-weighted density field $\Delta_\tau$ as well as its reconstruction uncertainty from the Lyman-alpha forest flux field. We utilise the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite at $4.1\leq z \leq 5.0$ as the main training and validation dataset. Leveraging the density field recovered by our neural network, we construct an inference pipeline to constrain the WDM particle masses based on the probability distribution function of the density fields. We find that our trained Bayesian neural network can accurately recover within a $1\sigma$ error $\geq 85\%$ of the density field pixels from a validation simulated dataset that encompasses multiple WDM and thermal models of the IGM. When predicting on Lyman-alpha skewers generated using the alternative hydrodynamical code Nyx not included in the training data, we find a $1\sigma$ accuracy rate $\geq 75\%$. We consider 2 samples of observed Lyman-alpha spectra from the UVES and GHOST instruments, at $z=4.4$ and $z=4.9$ respectively and fit the density fields recovered by our Bayesian neural network to constrain WDM masses. We find lower bounds on the WDM particle mass of $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 3.8$ KeV and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} \geq 2.2$ KeV at $2\sigma$ confidence, respectively. We are able to match current state-of-the-art WDM particle mass constraints using up to 40 times less observational data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques based on the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum.</description>

      <title>de Broglie scale time delays in pulsar networks for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of ultralight dark matter helps constrain the lower bound on minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales similar to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay and gravitational redshift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.</description>

      <title>The ViCTORIA project: description of a multi-frequency radio survey of the Virgo galaxy cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo cluster is the closest richest nearby galaxy cluster. It is in the formation process, with a number of sub-clusters undergoing merging and interactions. Although a great laboratory to study galaxy evolution and cluster formation, its large apparent size and the severe dynamic range limitations due to the presence of the bright radio source Virgo A (M 87) reduced the ability of past wide-area radio surveys to image the region with high sensitivity and fidelity. In this paper we describe the "Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of Interacting galaxies and AGN" (ViCTORIA) project. The survey and its data reduction strategy are designed to mitigate the challenges of this field and deliver: images from 42 MHz to 1.7 GHz frequencies of the Virgo cluster, about 60 times deeper than existing data, in full polarisation, and including a blind HI survey that aims at mapping seven times more galaxies than previous experiments and without selection biases. Data have been collected with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) and with MeerKAT in L-band, including polarisation and enough frequency resolution to conduct local HI studies. At the distance of Virgo, current radio instruments have the resolution to probe scales of ~500 pc and the sensitivity to study dwarf galaxies, the most fragile systems given their shallow gravitational potential wells, making Virgo a unique laboratory to study galaxy evolution and AGN feedback in a rich environment. In this work, we present some preliminary results, including high resolution images of the radio emission surrounding M 87, that show that the lobes are filled with filamentary structures. The combination of the presented radio surveys with state-of-the-art optical, UV, X-ray surveys will massively increase the scientific output from the studies of the Virgo cluster, making the ViCTORIA Project's legacy value outstanding.</description>

      <title>De-baryonifying halos via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback uncertainty is a limiting systematic for next-generation weak gravitational lensing analyses. At the same time, high-resolution weak lensing maps are best analyzed at the field-level. Thus, robustly accounting for the baryonic effects in the projected matter density field is required. Ideally, constraints on feedback strength from astrophysical probes should be folded into the weak lensing field-level likelihood. We propose a macroscopic method based on an empirical correlation between feedback strength and an optimal transport cost. Since feedback is local re-distribution of matter, optimal transport is a promising concept. In this proof-of-concept, we de-baryonify projected mass around individual halos in the IllustrisTNG simulation. We choose the de-baryonified solution as the point of maximum likelihood on the hypersurface defined by fixed optimal transport cost around the observed full-physics halos. The likelihood is approximated through a normalizing flow trained on multiple gravity-only simulations. We find that the set of de-baryonified halos reproduces the correct convergence power spectrum suppression. There is considerable scatter when considering individual halos. We outline how the optimal transport de-baryonification concept can be generalized to full convergence maps.</description>

      <title>Renormalized one-Loop Corrections in Power Spectrum in USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of one-loop corrections on long CMB scale modes in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase is under debate. In this work, we investigate the regularization and renormalization of the one-loop corrections of curvature perturbation power spectrum. Employing the UV-IR regularizations and performing the in-in analysis, we calculate the regularized one-loop corrections, including tadpole, in the power spectrum associated with cubic and quartic Hamiltonians. We show that the fully regularized and renormalized fractional loop correction in the power spectrum is controlled by the peak of the power spectrum at the end of USR phase, scaling like $ e^{6 \Delta {\cal N}}$ in which $\Delta {\cal N} $ is the duration of the USR phase. This confirms the original conclusion that the loop corrections can get out of perturbative control if the transition from the intermediate USR phase to the final SR phase is instantaneous and sharp.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee cosmology: Tests using distance- and time-redshift probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern cosmology, the discovery of the Universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia Supernovae and BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as recently included Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma Ray Bursts data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee model and compare it with the standard LCDM cosmology. Our results indicate that the bumblebee theory provides a compatible fit with current observational data across a range of its parameters, suggesting it as a viable alternative to the LCDM model.</description>

      <title>Constraining symmetron fields with a levitated optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetron, one of the light scalar fields introduced by dark energy theories, is thought to modify the gravitational force when it couples to matter. However, detecting the symmetron field is challenging due to its screening behavior in the high-density environment of traditional measurements. In this paper, we propose a scheme to set constraints on the parameters of the symmetron with a levitated optomechanical system, in which a nanosphere serves as a testing mass coupled to an optical cavity. By measuring the frequency shift of the probe transmission spectrum, we can establish constraints for our scheme by calculating the symmetron-induced influence. These refined constraints improve by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to current force-based detection methods, which offer new opportunities for the dark energy detection.</description>

      <title>What is the amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we re-evaluate the estimates of dust mass in galaxies and demonstrate that current dust models are incomplete and based on a priori assumptions. These models suffer from a circularity problem and account for only a small portion of dust, specifically submicron-sized grains. They overlook larger dust particles and other macroscopic bodies, despite observational evidence supporting their existence. This evidence includes the observed (sub)millimeter excess in dust emission spectra and the power-law size distribution with an index {\gamma} ~ 3.5-4.0, which has been measured for large particles and compact bodies across diverse environments. Examples of these large particles include large dust grains and meteoroids detected by satellites, near-Earth objects colliding with Earth, fragments in the Main Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt, interstellar 'Oumuamua-like objects, and exoplanets. As a result, dust-type baryonic dark matter may be more abundant throughout the galaxy by one order of magnitude or even more than previously assumed, with a significant portion of its mass concentrated in large compact bodies. Additionally, black holes may contribute significantly to the total mass of baryonic dark matter. Consequently, current galaxy models do not provide reliable estimates of baryonic mass in galaxies. Clearly, a substantially larger amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies would have major implications for theories of galaxy dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Test for MOND: Gravitational Lensing by Disc Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a number count of disc galaxy lenses of one order of magnitude higher than the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we show that disc galaxy gravitational lensing can be used to strongly constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <title>Identifying dark matter signals by the radio continuum spectral data of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the signals of dark matter annihilation is one of the most popular ways to understand the nature of dark matter. In particular, many recent studies are focussing on using radio data to examine the possible signals of dark matter revealed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. In this article, we investigate on the spectral data of the central radio halo of the cool-core cluster RX J1720.1+2638. We show that the radio spectral data can be best accounted by the synchrotron emission due to dark matter annihilation via $\tau$ lepton channel (with dark matter mass $m=15$ GeV) or $b$ quark channel (with dark matter mass $m=110$ GeV), although using the very coarse spectral data with notable errors. Despite the fact that cosmic-ray emission can also provide a good explanation for the observed radio spectrum, our results suggest a possible positive evidence for dark matter annihilation revealed in the form of radio emission in RX J1720.1+2638 cluster.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi-LAT satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified about 2900 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, including 69 reported here for the first time. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of about 500 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3.0. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for understanding the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be effectively measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>

      <title>CAPMAP: A New Instrument to Measure the E-mode CMB Polarization on Angular Scales of 4 arcmin to 40 arcmin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CMB polarization is the Everest in the quest to characterize the earliest photons from the Universe. After a long list of ever-decreasing upper limits, a detection of polarization was made in 2002 by the DASI team at ell =~ 500. The experiment described in this thesis is designed to make a more detailed measurements at higher angular resolution. The E-mode polarization power spectrum not only provides a more direct link to the properties of the last scattering surface than the temperature anisotropy but also offers complementary information which can be used to break various degeneracies in the determination of cosmological parameters. Most importantly, the existence of polarization is a robust prediction of the standard cosmological picture so a precise measurement of the CMB polarization should come as a confirmation of the standard model. However, polarization measurements represent an experimental challenge. The weakness of the polarization signal requires both a demanding instrumental sensitivity and focused attention to all sources of systematic error. This thesis describes the design, construction, and testing of a 90 GHz four-element array of correlation polarimeters to probe the E-mode polarization power spectrum at multipoles (ell) ranging from 500 to 1500. The array was fielded in Jan 2003 on the 7-meter Crawford Hill antenna, in Holmdel, New Jersey and observed for two months. The receiver calibration is described in detail, as well as the characterization of the pointing and beams. Preliminary analysis indicates that the instrument is sufficiently sensitive to detect the few micro Kelvin signal of the CMB polarization.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation, reheating and leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find that the same couplings responsible for reheating also contribute to generating part of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>

Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong lensing of background galaxies provides important information about the matter distribution around lens galaxies. Traditional modelling of such strong lenses is both time and resource intensive. Fast and automated analysis methods are the need of the hour given large upcoming surveys. In this work, we build and train a simple convolutional neural network with an aim of rapidly predicting model parameters of gravitational lenses. We focus on the inference of the Einstein radius, and ellipticity components of the mass distribution. We train our network on a variety of simulated data with increasing degree of realism and compare its performance on simulated test data in a quantitative manner. We also model 182 gravitational lenses from Subaru HSC survey using {\sc YattaLens} pipeline to infer their model parameters, which allow a benchmark to compare the predictions of the network. Given all considerations, we conclude that the network trained on simulated samples with lensed sources injected in empty HSC cutouts is the most robust, reproducing Einstein radii with an accuracy of about $10-20$ percent, a bias less than 5 percent, and an outlier fraction of the order of 10 percent. We argue in favour of the subtraction of the lens light before modelling the lens mass distribution. Our comparisons of the inferred parameters of 10 HSC lenses previously modelled in the literature, demonstrate agreement on the Einstein radius. However, the ellipticity components from the network as well as the individual modelling methods, seem to have systematic uncertainties beyond the quoted errors.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos with Diverse Baryonic Distributions: A Parametric Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies residing in dark matter halos exert significant gravitational effects that alter halo structure and dynamics. The complexity of these interactions escalates with the diversity of galactic structures and the variability in dark matter halo profiles under self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models. This work extends the parametric model for dark matter-only halos presented in arXiv:2305.16176 to incorporate baryons. We adapt this model to consistently represent the SIDM halo density profile over time, highlighting the role of a gravothermal phase in characterizing the state of an SIDM halo. Given this phase, the density profile in SIDM is determined by a fictitious progenitor -- consisting of an NFW halo influenced by a baryonic potential -- that has evolved to its present state. In the temporal dimension, the model incorporates a form factor that rescales the evolution time in the dark matter-only case, thereby enabling the introduction of a universal phase. In the radial dimension, the halo density profile is parametrized to reflect the influences of baryons. We calibrate the model through N-body simulations with baryon potentials to fit various stellar-to-halo mass ratios and size-mass relationships. Our parametric approach is numerically efficient, enabling the exploration of SIDM effects across a diverse set of halos, as exemplified by a case study using an illustrative sample that spans five orders of magnitude in the mass range. We also demonstrate that the effects of evolution history and the specific SIDM model can be separated from the current states of galaxies and halos, leaving the task of identifying consistent SIDM models to dedicated post-processing analyses.</description>

      <title>A model-independent measurement of the expansion and growth rates from BOSS using the FreePower method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a data analysis of the BOSS galaxy clustering data with the recently proposed FreePower method, which adopts as parameters the power spectrum band-powers, the expansion rate, and the growth rate instead of specific cosmological parametrizations. It relies on the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect and redshift-space distortions, and makes use of one-loop perturbation theory for biased tracers. In this way, we obtain for the first time constraints on the linear growth rate, on the Hubble parameter, as well as on the dimensionless distance $H_0 D_A$ and various bias functions, that are independent of a model for the power spectrum shape and thus of both the early and late-time cosmological modelling. Using broad priors we find at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, $f=0.67^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, $H/H_0=1.033^{+0.13}_{-0.081}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.264^{+0.026}_{-0.039}$ and at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$, $f=0.82^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$, $H/H_0=1.085^{+0.16}_{-0.067}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.390^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We find lower $H/H_0$ results than expected from Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM results at a confidence level of $1.7\sigma$ $(2.1\sigma)$ for low-$z$ (hi-$z$). The precision in these results demonstrates the capabilities of the FreePower method. We also get constraints on the bias parameters which are in agreement with constraints from previous BOSS analyses, which serves as a cross-check of our pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory Remixed II: Improved Modeling of Nonlinear Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the application of the $n$-th order Eulerian Perturbation Theory ($n$EPT) for modeling the matter bispectrum in real space as an advancement over the Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT). The $n$EPT method, detailed in Wang et al. (2023) \cite{Wang2023nEPT}, sums up the density perturbations up to the $n$-th order before computing summary statistics such as bispectrum. Taking advantage of grid-based calculation of SPT (GridSPT), we make a realization-based comparison of the analytical nonlinear bispectrum predictions from $n$EPT and SPT against a suite of $N$-body simulations. Using a spherical-bispectrum visualization scheme, we show that $n$EPT bispectrum matches better than SPT bispectrum over a wide range of scales in general $w$CDM cosmologies. Like the power spectrum case, we find that $n$EPT bispectrum modeling accuracy is controlled by $\sigma_8(z) \equiv \sigma_8 D(z)$, where $D(z)$ is the linear growth factor at a redshift $z$. Notably, the 6EPT doubles the bispectrum model's validity range compared to the one-loop SPT for $\sigma_8(z) &lt; 0.5$, corresponding to redshifts $z\ge1$ for the best-fitting Planck-2018 cosmology. For $n\ge5$, however, $n$EPT bispectrum depends sensitively on the cut-off scale or the grid resolution. The percent-level modeling accuracy achieved for the spherical bispectrum (where we average over all triangular configurations) becomes much degraded when fixing configurations. Thus, we show that the validity range of the field-level cosmological inferences must be different from that derived from averaged summary statistics such as $n$-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an aim towards modeling cosmologies beyond the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, we demonstrate the automatic construction of recombination history emulators while enforcing a prior of causal dynamics. These methods are particularly useful in the current era of precision cosmology, where extremely constraining datasets provide insights into a cosmological model dominated by unknown contents. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in particular provide a clean glimpse into the interaction of dark matter, baryons, and radiation in the early Universe, but interpretation of this data requires knowledge of the Universe's ionization history. The exploration of new physics with new CMB data will require fast and flexible calculation of this ionization history. We develop a differentiable machine learning model for recombination physics using a neural network ordinary differential equation architecture (Universal Differential Equations, UDEs), building towards automatic dimensionality reduction and the avoidance of manual tuning based on cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial lepton asymmetries with full neutrino transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries can be constrained through big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) relic abundances and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, both observables being sensitive to neutrino properties. The latter constraint, which is due to gravitational effects from all neutrino flavors, is very minute since it is at least quadratic in the asymmetries. On the contrary, the constraints from primordial abundances presently dominate, although these abundances are almost only sensitive to the electron flavor asymmetry. It is generally assumed that neutrino asymmetries are sufficiently averaged by flavor oscillations prior to BBN, which allows one to constrain a common primordial neutrino asymmetry at the epoch of BBN. This simplified approach suffers two caveats that we deal with in this article, combining a neutrino evolution code and BBN calculation throughout the MeV era. First, flavor "equilibration" is not true in general, therefore an accurate dynamical evolution of asymmetries is needed to connect experimental observables to the primordial asymmetries. Second, the approximate averaging of asymmetries through flavor oscillations is associated to a reheating of the primordial plasma. It is therefore crucial to correctly describe the interplay between flavor equilibration and neutrino decoupling, as an energy redistribution prior to decoupling does not significantly alter the final effective number of neutrino species' value. Overall, we find that the space of allowed initial asymmetries is generically unbound when using currently available primordial abundances and CMB measurements. We forecast constraints using future CMB experiment capabilities, which should reverse this experimental misfortune.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>

Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Gas-Rich Galaxies at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes ($&gt;10^6$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) beyond the redshift of $z=10$. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z $\gtrsim 10$). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range $10^8$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to $10^5$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in just $10^4$ years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework. In this work, we neglect radiative feedback processes from stellar evolution and from accretion onto the growing black holes. This likely means that our results represent an upper limit to light seed growth. We will address these shortcomings in future work.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. The result indicates that it is not a problem in the UV region but a question of the contributions of heavy fields being suppressed. Here we give it a possible description via probability distributions of energy and/or degrees of freedom. There are parameter spaces that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Kicking the Tires on Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2 \times 10^{-16} M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>
