      <title>Lower deviations for branching processes with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Y_{n}$, $n \geq 1\}$ be a critical branching process with immigration having finite variance for the offspring number of particles and finite mean for the immigrating number of particles. In this paper, we study lower deviation probabilities for $Y_{n}$. More precisely, assuming that $k,n \to \infty$ such that $k=o\left(n \right)$, we investigate the asymptotics of $\mathbf{P}\left(Y_{n} \leq k \right)$ and $\mathbf{P}\left(Y_{n} = k \right)$. Our results clarify the role of the moment conditions in the local limit theorem for $Y_n$ proven by Mellein.</description>

      <title>Limiting partition function for the Mallows model: a conjecture and partial evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations of $n$ labels. We consider a class of Gibbs probability models on $S_n$ that is a subfamily of the so-called Mallows model of random permutations. The Gibbs energy is given by a class of right invariant divergences on $S_n$ that includes common choices such as the Spearman foot rule and the Spearman rank correlation. Mukherjee in 2016 computed the limit of the (scaled) log partition function (i.e. normalizing factor) of such models as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Our objective is to compute the exact limit, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, without the log. We conjecture that this limit is given by the Fredholm determinant of an integral operator related to the so-called Schr\"odinger bridge probability distributions from optimal transport theory. We provide partial evidence for this conjecture, although the argument lacks a final error bound that is needed for it to become a complete proof.</description>

      <title>On estimation of the convergence rate to invariant measures in markov branching processes with possibly infinite variance and allowing immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses the continuous-time Markov Branching Process allowing Immigration. We are considering a critical case for which the second moment of offspring law and the first moment of immigration law are possibly infinite. Assuming that the nonlinear parts of the appropriate generating functions are regularly varying in the sense of Karamata, we prove theorems on convergence of transition functions of the process to invariant measures. We deduce the speed rate of these convergence providing that slowly varying factors are with the remainder.</description>

      <title>Mosco convergence of independent particles and applications to particle systems with self-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of Markov processes $\lbrace X_t^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \rbrace$ with Dirichlet forms converging in the Mosco sense of Kuwae and Shioya to the Dirichlet form associated with a Markov process $X_t$. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that for any natural number $k$, the sequence of Dirichlet forms corresponding to the Markov processes generated by $k$ independent copies of $\lbrace X_t^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \rbrace$ also converges. As expected, the limit of this convergence is the Dirichlet form associated with $k$ independent copies of the process $X_t$. We provide applications of this result in the context of interacting particle systems with Markov moment duality.</description>

      <title>On P\'olya-Young urn models and growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to P\'olya-Young urns, a class of periodic P\'olya urns of importance in the analysis of Young tableaux. We provide several extension of the previous results of Banderier, Marchal and Wallner [Ann. Prob. (2020)] on P\'olya-Young urns and also generalize the previously studied model. We determine the limit law of the generalized model, involving the the local time of noise-reinforced Bessel processes. We also uncover a martingale structure, which leads directly to almost-sure convergence of the random variable of interest. This allows us to add second order asymptotics by providing a central limit theorem for the martingale tail sum, as well as a law of the iterated logarithm. We also turn to random vectors and obtain the limit law of P\'olya-Young urns with multiple colors. Additionally, we introduce several growth processes and combinatorial objects, which are closely related to urn models. We define increasing trees with periodic immigration and we related the dynamics of the P\'olya-Young urns to label-based parameters in such tree families. Furthermore, we discuss a generalization of Stirling permutations and obtain a bijection to increasing trees with periodic immigration. Finally, we introduce a chinese restaurant process with competition and relate it to increasing trees, as well as P\'olya-Young urns.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Strong Laws of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using proof-theoretic methods in the style of proof mining, we give novel computationally effective limit theorems for the convergence of the Cesaro-means of certain sequences of random variables. These results are intimately related to various Strong Laws of Large Numbers and, in that way, allow for the extraction of quantitative versions of many of these results. In particular, we produce optimal polynomial bounds in the case of pairwise independent random variables with uniformly bounded variance, improving on known results; furthermore, we obtain a new Baum-Katz type result for this class of random variables. Lastly, we are able to provide a fully quantitative version of a recent result of Chen and Sung that encompasses many limit theorems in the Strong Laws of Large Numbers literature.</description>

      <title>Global well posedness and ergodic results in regular Sobolev spaces for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative noise and arbitrary power of the nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^d$, with the nonlinearity of polynomial type $|u|^{2\sigma}u$. For any $\sigma \in \mathbb N$ and $s&gt;\frac d2$ we prove that adding to this equation a suitable stochastic forcing term there exists a unique global solution for any initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T^d)$. The effect of the noise is to prevent blow-up in finite time, differently from the deterministic setting. Moreover we prove existence of invariant measures and their uniqueness under more restrictive assumptions on the noise term.</description>

      <title>Fractional Gaussian forms and gauge theory: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Gaussian fields are scalar-valued random functions or generalized functions on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, indexed by a parameter $s$. They include white noise ($s = 0$), Brownian motion ($s=1, n=1$), the 2D Gaussian free field ($s = 1, n=2$) and the membrane model ($s = 2$). These simple objects are ubiquitous in math and science, and can be used as a starting point for constructing non-Gaussian theories.
  The $\textit{differential form}$ analogs of these objects are equally natural: for example, instead of considering an instance $h(x)$ of the GFF on $\mathbb R^2$, one might write $h_1(x)dx_1 + h_2(x) dx_2$ where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are independent GFF instances.
  In general, given $k \in \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, an instance of the $\textit{fractional Gaussian $k$-form}$ with parameter $s \in \mathbb R$ (abbreviated $\mathrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$) is given by $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{s}{2}} W_k,$ where $W_k$ is a $k$-form-valued white noise. We write $$\textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)_{d=0} \quad \textrm{and} \quad \textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)_{d^*=0}$$ for the $L^2$ orthogonal projections of $\textrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$ onto the space of $k$-forms on which $d$ (resp.\ $d^*$) vanishes. We explain how $\mathrm{FGF}_s^k(M)$ and its projections transform under $d$ and $d^*$, as well as wedge/Hodge-star operators, subspace restrictions, and axial projections.
  We discuss how the $1$-form $\textrm{FGF}_1^1(M)$ and its $\textit{gauge-fixed}$ projection $\textrm{FGF}_1^1(M)_{d^*=0}$ are related to gauge theories, and we formulate several conjectures and open problems about scaling limits, including possible off-critical/non-Gaussian limits, whose construction in the Yang-Mills setting is a famous open problem.</description>

      <title>On joint returns to zero of Bessel processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider joint returns to zero of $n$ Bessel processes ($n\geq 2$): our main goal is to estimate the probability that they avoid having joint returns to zero for a long time. More precisely, considering $n$ independent Bessel processes $(X_t^{(i)})_{1\leq i \leq n}$ of dimension $\delta \in (0,1)$, we are interested in the first joint return to zero of any two of them: \[ H_n := \inf\big\{ t&gt;0, \exists 1\leq i &lt;j \leq n \text{ such that } X_t^{(i)} = X_t^{(j)} =0 \big\} \,. \] We prove the existence of a persistence exponent $\theta_n$ such that $\mathbb{P}(H_n&gt;t) = t^{-\theta_n+o(1)}$ as $t\to\infty$, and we provide some non-trivial bounds on $\theta_n$. In particular, when $n=3$, we show that $2(1-\delta)\leq \theta_3 \leq 2 (1-\delta) + f(\delta)$ for some (explicit) function $f(\delta)$ with $\sup_{[0,1]} f(\delta) \approx 0.079$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of Generalized Elephant Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elephant random walk is a special type of random walk that incorporates the memory of the past to determine its future steps. The probability of this walk taking a particular step (+1 or -1) at a time point, conditioned on the entire history, depends on a linear function of the proportion of that step till that time point. In this work, we investigate how the dynamics of the random walk will change if we replace this linear function by a generic map satisfying some analytic conditions. We also propose a new model, called the multidimensional generalized elephant random walk, that incorporates several variants of elephant random walk in one and higher dimensions and their generalizations thereof. Using tools from the theory of stochastic approximation, we derive the asymptotic behavior of our model leading to newer results on the phase transition boundary between diffusive and superdiffusive regimes. We also mention a few open problems in this context.</description>

      <title>Heavy tails and negative correlation in a binomial model for sports matches: applications to curling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binomial model for sports matches is developed making use of the maximum possible score $n$ in a game. In contrast to previous approaches the scores of the two teams are negatively correlated, abstracting from a scenario whereby teams cancel each other out. When $n$ is known, analytical results are possible via a Gaussian approximation. Model calibration is obtained via generalized linear modelling, enabling elementary econometric and strategic analysis to be performed. Inter alia this includes quantifying the Last Stone First End effect, analogous to the home-field advantage found in conventional sports. When $n$ is unknown the model behaviour is richer and leads to heavy-tailed non-Gaussian behaviour. We present an approximate analysis of this case based on the Variance Gamma distribution.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Process and Approximate Dynamic Programming for a Patient Assignment Scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Patient Assignment Scheduling (PAS) problem in a random environment that arises in the management of patient flow in the hospital systems, due to the stochastic nature of the arrivals as well as the Length of Stay distribution. We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which aims to assign the newly arrived patients in an optimal way so as to minimise the total expected long-run cost per unit time over an infinite horizon. We assume Poisson arrival rates that depend on patient types, and Length of Stay distributions that depend on whether patients stay in their primary wards or not. Since the instances of realistic size of this problem are not easy to solve, we develop numerical methods based on Approximate Dynamic Programming. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples with parameters obtained by fitting to data from a tertiary referral hospital in Australia, and demonstrate the application potential of our methodology under practical considerations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, given a sufficiently long sequence of events in a probability space all of measure at least $\varepsilon$, some $n$ of them will have a common intersection. A more subtle pattern: for any $0 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; 1$, we cannot find events $A_i$ and $B_i$ so that $\mu \left( A_i \cap B_j \right) \leq p$ and $\mu \left( A_j \cap B_i\right) \geq q$ for all $1 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; n$, assuming $n$ is sufficiently large. This is closely connected to model-theoretic stability of probability algebras. We survey some results from our recent work on more complicated patterns that arise when our events are indexed by multiple indices. In particular, how such results are connected to higher arity generalizations of de Finetti's theorem in probability, structural Ramsey theory, hypergraph regularity in combinatorics, and model theory.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>

      <title>Borel-Cantelli, zero-one laws and inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most versatile version of the classical divergence Borel-Cantelli lemma shows that for any divergent sequence of events $E_n$ in a probability space satisfying a quasi-independence condition, its corresponding limsup set $E_\infty$ has positive probability. In particular, it provides a lower bound on the probability of $E_\infty$. In this paper we establish a new version of this classical result which guarantees, under an additional mild assumption, that the probability of $E_\infty$ is not just positive but is one. Unlike existing optimal results, it is applicable within the setting of arbitrary probability spaces. We then go onto to consider a range of applications in number theory and dynamical systems. These include new results on the inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture. In particular, we establish alternatives to the classical (homogeneous) zero-one laws of Cassels and Gallagher and use them to resolve the so-called weak Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture for an arbitrary rational inhomogeneous shift. As a bi-product, we establish the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture with congruence relations. The applications to dynamical systems include new characterisations of Borel-Cantelli sequences and new dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemmas, as well as characterising Khintchine-type sequences for shrinking targets.</description>

      <title>A change-point problem for $m$-dependent multivariate random field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a change-point problem for a centered, stationary and $m$-dependent multivariate random field. Under the distribution free assumption, a change-point test using CUSUM statistic is proposed to detect anomalies within a multidimensional random field, controlling the false positive rate as well as the Family-Wise Error in the multiple hypotheses testing context.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorems for Constrained Mittag-Leffler Ensemble in Hard Edge Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the hard-edge scaling of the Mittag-Leffler ensemble confined to a fixed disk inside the droplet. Our primary emphasis is on fluctuations of rotationally-invariant additive statistics that depend on the radius and thus give rise to radius-dependent stochastic processes. For the statistics originating from bounded measurable functions, we establish a central limit theorem in the appropriate functional space. By assuming further regularity, we are able to extend the result to a vector functional central limit theorem that additionally includes the first hitting "time" of the radius-dependent statistic. The proof of the first theorem involves an approximation by exponential random variables alongside a coupling technique. The proof of the second result rests heavily on Skorohod's almost sure representation theorem and builds upon a result of Galen Shorack (1973).</description>

Abstract: Consider a supercritical branching random walk in a time-inhomogeneous random environment. We impose a selection (called barrier) on survival in the following way. The position of the barrier may depend on the generation and the environment. %to indexed by time $n,$ i.e.,$\{\L_n\}$with a random absorption barrier In each generation, only the individuals born below the barrier can survive and reproduce. When the barrier causes the extinction of the system, we give the extinction rate in the sense of $L^p~(p\geq 1)$. Moreover, we show the $L^p$ convergence of the small deviation probability for a random walk with random environment in time.</description>

Abstract: Let $(Z_n)$ be a supercritical branching process with immigration in a random environment. The small positive values and some lower deviation inequalities for $Z$ are investigated. Based on these results, the central limit theorem of $\log Z_n$ and the Edgeworth expansion are obtained.

      <title>Lower bound for large transversal fluctuations in exactly solvable KPZ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of transversal fluctuation of the optimal path has been a crucial aspect of the Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this paper, we establish a new probability lower bound, with optimal exponential order, for the rare event in which a given level of the optimal path has a large transversal fluctuation. We present our results in both zero and positive temperature settings. The previously known lower bounds were obtained in zero temperature models, and they hold for the maximum transversal fluctuation along the entire geodesic (Hammond-Sarkar'20) or the starting portion of the geodesic at a local scale (Agarwal'23). Our result improves upon these as now the rare event can demand where the large fluctuation occurs exactly along the optimal path, on both local and global scales. Our proof utilizes the coupling method: we first obtain a version of the estimate in the semi-infinite setting using duality and then transfer the result to finite paths using planar monotonicity. Our method differs from the previous works (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20), and in fact, we do not require fine information about the left tail moderate deviation, which played a crucial role in (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20).</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ converges strongly to a family $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ in a $C^*$-algebra if $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x})\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a central role in several recent breakthrough results on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, strong convergence is notoriously difficult to prove and has generally required delicate problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a sharp understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of solutions to stochastic hybrid models of gene regulatory networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Kurasov, L\"uck, Mugnolo and Wolf, a hybrid gene regulatory network was proposed to model gene expression dynamics by using a stochastic system of coupled partial differential equations. This approach approximates protein counts in cells by modelling them as distributions. In a follow-up paper, the existence and strong convergence of the solutions to equilibrium was proven. In this paper, we make use of a recent convergence theorem for stochastic, irreducible semigroups that contain partial integral operators. In particular, we improve upon their results by showing that the convergence rate is independent of the initial distribution of proteins, therefore proving that the solutions converge not only strongly but even uniformly to equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extended variational framework for nonlinear SPDEs with unbounded noise, defining three different solution types of increasing strength along with criteria to establish their existence. The three notions can be understood as probabilistically and analytically weak, probabilistically strong and analytically weak, as well as probabilistically and analytically strong. Our framework facilitates several well-posedness results for the Navier-Stokes Equation with transport noise, equipped with the no-slip and Navier boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=|a\Delta b|/|a\cup b|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$. In addition, we show that a much smaller subset of $2^X$ suffices to resolve, with high probability, all different pairs of subsets of $X$ of cardinality at most $\sqrt{|X|}/\ln|X|$, up to a factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an explicit characterisation of L\'evy measures on both $L^p$-spaces and UMD Banach spaces. In the case of $L^p$-spaces, L\'evy measures are characterised by an integrability condition, which directly generalises the known description of L\'evy measures on sequence spaces. The latter has been the only known description of L\'evy measures on infinite dimensional Banach spaces that are not Hilbert. L\'evy measures on UMD Banach spaces are characterised by the finiteness of the expectation of a random {\gamma}-radonifying norm. Although this description is more abstract, it reduces to simple integrability conditions in the case of $L^p$-spaces.</description>

Abstract: We use representation theory of the symmetric group S_n to prove Poisson limit theorems for the distribution of fixed points for three types of non-uniform permutations. First, we give results for the commutator of g and x where g and x are uniform in S_n. Second, we give results for the commutator of g and x where g in uniform in S_n and x is fixed. Third, we give results for permutations obtained by multiplying n*log(n)/i + cn many random i-cycles. Some of our results are known by other, quite different, methods.</description>

      <title>A projected Euler Method for Random Periodic Solutions of Semi-linear SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work introduces and investigates an explicit time discretization scheme, called the projected Euler method, to numerically approximate random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs under non-globally Lipschitz conditions. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. Without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations, the mean square convergence rate is proved to be order 0.5 for SDEs with multiplicative noise and order 1 for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical examples are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>
