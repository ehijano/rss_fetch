      <title>Periodic Hypersurfaces and Lee-Yang Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Fourier criterion for a $\mathbb{Z}^n$-periodic $C^{1+\epsilon}$-hypersurface $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ to be algebraic in the sense that $\Sigma=\Sigma(p):=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n : p(e^{2\pi i x_1},\dots,e^{2\pi i x_n})=0\}$ for some polynomial $p$. More precisely, each direction $\ell\in\mathbb{R}^n$ defines a periodic measure $m_{\ell}$ on $\Sigma$ by $dm_{\ell}(x)=|\langle\ell,\hat n(x)\rangle|\,d\sigma(x)$, with $\hat n(x)$ the unit normal to $\Sigma$ and $\sigma$ its $n-1$ dimensional surface measure. Our Fourier criterion for $\Sigma$ is that there exists $\ell\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with Q-linearly independent entries and a closed cone $C\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ for which $\langle\ell,v\rangle&gt;0$ for all nonzero $v\in C$, such that for $k\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ we have $\widehat{m}_{\ell}(k)=\int_{\Sigma/\mathbb{Z}^n}e^{2\pi i\langle k,x\rangle}\,dm_{\ell}(x)=0$ for every $k\notin C\cup(-C)$. Using Meyers terminology this says $(m_{\ell},C)$ is a "lighthouse". Under this hypothesis one shows $\Sigma=\Sigma(p)$, and after a suitable monomial change $p$ can be taken as a Lee-Yang polynomial. The proof relies on a recent characterization of all one-dimensional Fourier quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Delta-matroids and toric degenerations in OG(n,2n+1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit, embedded degeneration of the general torus orbit closure in the maximal orthogonal Grassmannian OG(n,2n+1) into a union of Richardson varieties. In particular, we deduce a formula for the cohomology class of the torus orbit closure, as a sum of products of Schubert classes. The moment map images of the degenerate pieces are the base polytopes of their underlying delta-matroids, and give a polyhedral decomposition of the unit hypercube.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of complements of fiber-type curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study the homotopy type of the complement of a plane projective curve of fiber-type. Roughly speaking, a curve of fiber-type is a finite union of fibers of a pencil. Under some restrictions, a full description of their homotopy type is given. In the context of fiber-type curves, we also partially answer in the positive a question originally posed by Libgober on the homotopy type of complements of plane curves, namely, whether or not the homotopy type of a curve complement is determined by the fundamental group and its Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>Intersection cohomology of Vinberg-Popov varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vinberg-Popov variety of a simply connected reductive algebraic group $G$ is a singular affine variety that contains the basic affine space $G/U$ as a Zariski open subset. It is defined as the spectrum of the ring of functions on $G/U$, and can also be identified with the universal symplectic implosion for the maximal compact subgroup of $G$. We provide a recursive procedure for computing the intersection cohomology of this variety, with an emphasis on the case where $G = \operatorname{SL}_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the motivic cohomology of mixed characteristic schemes, introduced in our previous work, satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including a motivic refinement of Weibel's vanishing in algebraic $K$-theory, the projective bundle formula, a comparison to Milnor $K$-theory, and a universal characterisation in terms of pro cdh descent. These results extend those of Elmanto--Morrow to schemes which are not necessarily defined over a field.</description>

      <title>Hilbert scheme and Hilbert functions of smooth curves of degrees at most $15$ in $\mathbb{P}^5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoting $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,5}$ by the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\mathbb{P}^5$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be an irreducible component of $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,5}$. We study the Hilbert function $h_X:\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow\mathbb{N}$, $h_X(t):= h^0(\mathcal{I}_X(t))$ of a general member $X\in\mathcal{H}$, especially when the degree of the curve is low; $d\le 15$. We also determine the irreducibility of $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,5}$ for $d\le 14$ and study the natural functorial map $\mu :$\mathcal{H}_{d,g,5}$ \longrightarrow \mathcal{M}_g$ in some detail. We describe the fibre $\mu^{-1}\mu(X)$ for a general $X\in\mathcal{H} $ as well as determining the projective normality (or being ACM).</description>

      <title>On the uniform positivity of $F$-signature under reduction modulo $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carvajal-Rojas, Schwede and Tucker asked whether the mod $p$ reductions of a complex klt type singularity have uniformly positive $F$-signature for almost all primes $p$. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this conjecture in the case of pure subrings of regular local rings--for example, reductive quotient singularities. We also show that the conjecture can be reduced to the Gorenstein case. Finally, we discuss the connection with $F$-alpha invariants--a characteristic $p$ analog of Tian's alpha invariants introduced by Pande--for log Fano pairs.</description>

      <title>Testing the variety hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a probability measure on the unit disk, we study the problem of deciding whether, for some threshold probability, this measure is supported near a real algebraic variety of given dimension and bounded degree. We call this "testing the variety hypothesis". We prove an upper bound on the so-called "sample complexity" of this problem and show how it can be reduced to a semialgebraic decision problem. This is done by studying in a quantitative way the Hausdorff geometry of the space of real algebraic varieties of a given dimension and degree.</description>

      <title>The ranks of twists of an elliptic curve in characteristic $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$ over $\mathbb{F}_9$, a curve $\mathcal{X}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{3^{2n}}$ and a cyclic cover of $\mathcal{X}$ of degree $m \in \{2,3,4,6\}$, we construct the corresponding $m$-twists over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{3^{2n}}(\mathcal{X})$. We also obtain the Mordell-Weil rank of these twists in terms of the Zeta functions of $\mathcal{X}$ and of suitable Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions of it. Finally, we also describe the fibers of the elliptic fibration associated to such twists in the case $\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Endoscopy for metaplectic affine Hecke categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a possibly twisted loop group $LG$, and any character sheaf of its Iwahori subgroup, we identify the associated affine Hecke category with a combinatorial category of Soergel bimodules. In fact, we prove such results for affine Hecke categories arising from central extensions of the loop group $LG$. Our results work for mod $\ell$ or integral $\ell$-adic coefficients.
  As applications, we obtain endoscopic equivalences between affine Hecke categories, including the derived Satake equivalence for metaplectic groups, and a series of conjectures by Gaitsgory in quantum geometric Langlands.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability of derived categories in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.00994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the moduli space of semiorthogonal decompositions in a smooth projective family introduced by the second, the third and the fourth author, we discuss indecomposability results for derived categories in families. In particular, we prove that given a smooth projective family of varieties, if the derived category of the general fibre does not admit a semiorthogonal decomposition, the same happens for every fibre of the family. As a consequence, we deduce that in a smooth family of complex projective varieties, if there exists a fibre such that the base locus of its canonical linear series is either empty or finite, then any fibre of the family has indecomposable derived category.
  Then we apply our results to achieve indecomposability of the derived categories of various explicit classes of varieties, as e.g. $n$-fold symmetric products of curves (with $0&lt;n&lt;\lfloor (g+3)/2 \rfloor$), Horikawa surfaces, an interesting class of double covers of the projective plane introduced by Ciliberto, and Hilbert schemes of points on these two classes of surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the descent conjecture for rational points and zero-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The descent method is one of the approaches to study the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the local--global principle and to weak approximation on varieties over number fields, by reducing the problem to ``descent varieties''. In recent lecture notes by Wittenberg, he formulated a ``descent conjecture'' for torsors under linear algebraic groups. The present article gives a proof of this conjecture in the case of connected groups, generalizing the toric case from the previous work of Harpaz--Wittenberg. As an application, we deduce directly from Sansuc's work the theorem of Borovoi for homogeneous spaces of connected linear algebraic groups with connected stabilizers. We are also able to reduce the general case to the case of finite (\'etale) torsors. When the set of rational points is replaced by the Chow group of zero-cycles, an analogue of the above conjecture for arbitrary linear algebraic groups is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the structure theorem for smooth projective varieties with nef tangent bundle to projective klt varieties whose tangent sheaf is either positively curved or almost nef. Specifically, we show that such a variety $X$, up to a finite quasi-\'etale cover, admits a rationally connected fibration $X \to A$ onto an abelian variety $A$. For the proof, we develop the theory of positivity of coherent sheaves on projective varieties. As applications, we establish some relations between the geometric properties and positivity of tangent sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up formula of weighted stability for polarized toric manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety, and let $\widetilde{X}$ denote the blow-up of $X$ at finitely many distinct tours-invariant points. This paper provides an explicit combinatorial formula for the Chow weight of $\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the symplectic cuts of its associated Delzant polytope. We apply this blow-up formula to the projective plane and compare Chow stability of toric blow-ups with that of blow-ups at general points. Furthermore, we derive the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant, which serves an obstruction to asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold. In the final section, we extend our approach to study blow-up formulas for weighted (Chow/K-) stability using our combinatorial framework.</description>

Abstract: The main result is that when the genus is at least 3, the rank of the normal function function of the Ceresa cycle over the moduli space of curves has maximal rank. This result was proved independently by Z. Gao and S.-W. Zhang (arXiv:2407.01304) by different methods. In genus 3 we show that the Green--Griffiths invariant of this normal function is a Teichmuller modular form of weight (4,0,-1) and use this to show that the rank of the Ceresa normal function is exactly 1 along the hyperelliptic locus.</description>

      <title>Abundance and SYZ conjecture in families of hyperkahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a hyperkahler manifold $M$, with $c_1(L)$ nef and not big. SYZ conjecture predicts that $L$ is semiample. We prove that this is true, assuming that $(M,L)$ has a deformation $(M',L')$ with $L'$ semiample. We introduce a version of the Teichmuller space that parametrizes pairs $(M,L)$ up to isotopy. We prove a version of the global Torelli theorem for such Teichmuller spaces and use it to deduce the deformation invariance of semiampleness.</description>

      <title>Real Toric Varieties: Interactions between their Geometry and their Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, we investigate the topology of real toric varieties, especially those whose torus is not split over the field of real numbers. We describe some canonical fibrations associated to their real loci. Then, we establish various properties of their cohomology provided that their real loci are compact and smooth. For instance, we compute their Betti numbers, show that their cohomology is totally algebraic, and extend a criterion of orientability. In addition, we provide the topological classification of equivariant embeddings of non-split tridimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <title>On direct summands of products of Jacobians over arbitrary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a principally polarized abelian variety over a field $k$ is, as an abelian variety, a direct summand of a product of Jacobians of curves which contain a $k$-point if and only if the polarization and the minimal class are both algebraic over $k$. This extends results of Beckmann--de Gaay Fortman and Voisin over the complex numbers to arbitrary fields, and refines an obstruction to the direct summand property over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Petrov--Skorobogatov. We also give applications to the integral Tate conjecture for divisors and for $1$-cycles on abelian varieties over finitely generated fields; our results also address a $p$-adic version of the integral Tate conjecture over finite fields of characteristic $p$, for the first time beyond the case of divisors.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of sets of points in the plane that satisfy distance conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given graph whose edges are labeled with general real numbers, we consider the set of functions from the vertex set into the Euclidean plane such that the distance between the images of neighbouring vertices is equal to the corresponding edge label. This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>
