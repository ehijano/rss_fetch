      <title>Sensor Fusion for Track Geometry Monitoring: Integrating On-Board Data and Degradation Models via Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Track geometry monitoring is essential for maintaining the safety and efficiency of railway operations. While Track Recording Cars (TRCs) provide accurate measurements of track geometry indicators, their limited availability and high operational costs restrict frequent monitoring across large rail networks. Recent advancements in on-board sensor systems installed on in-service trains offer a cost-effective alternative by enabling high-frequency, albeit less accurate, data collection. This study proposes a method to enhance the reliability of track geometry predictions by integrating low-accuracy sensor signals with degradation models through a Kalman filter framework. An experimental campaign using a low-cost sensor system mounted on a TRC evaluates the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that incorporating frequent sensor data significantly reduces prediction uncertainty, even when the data is noisy. The study also investigates how the frequency of data recording influences the size of the credible prediction interval, providing guidance on the optimal deployment of on-board sensors for effective track monitoring and maintenance planning.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Distributed Circuits Using Single-Step Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification. Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent ``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.</description>

      <title>Tram Positioning with Map-Enabled GNSS Data Reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to tackle the problem of tram localization through utilizing a custom processing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observables and the track map. The method is motivated by suboptimal performance in dense urban environments where the direct line of sight to GNSS satellites is often obscured which leads to multipath propagation of GNSS signals. The presented concept is based upon the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and has linear complexity (with respect to the number of GNSS measurements) as opposed to some other techniques mitigating the multipath signal propagation. The technique is demonstrated both on a simulated example and real data. The root-mean-squared errors from the simulated ground truth positions show that the presented solution is able to improve performance compared to a baseline localization approach. Similar result is achieved for the experiment with real data, while treating orthogonal projections onto the tram track as the true position, which is unavailable in the realistic scenario. This proof-of-concept shows results which may be further improved with implementation of a bank-of-models method or $\chi^2$-based rejection of outlying GNSS pseudorange measurements.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of CNNs and MLPs for Radiation Heat Transfer in 2-D Furnaces with Spectrally Participative Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring Noncommutative Polynomial Equation Methods for Discrete-Time Quaternionic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new polynomial-based methods for discrete-time quaternionic systems, highlighting how noncommutative multiplication modifies classical control approaches. Defining quaternionic polynomials via a backward-shift operator, we examine left and right fraction representations of transfer functions, showing that right zeros correspond to similarity classes of quaternionic matrix right eigenvalues. We then propose a feedback design procedure that generalizes pole placement to quaternions - a first approach using a genuine quaternionic polynomial equation.</description>

      <title>Followstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.</description>

      <title>Joint Routing and Control Optimization in VANET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRoute, an adaptive joint optimization framework for dynamic vehicular networks that simultaneously addresses platoon control and data transmission through trajectory-aware routing and safety-constrained vehicle coordination. DynaRoute guarantees continuous vehicle movement via platoon safety control with optimizing transmission paths through real-time trajectory prediction and ensuring reliable data. Our solution achieves three key objectives: (1) maintaining platoon stability through accurate data transmission, (2) enabling adaptive routing based on vehicle movement patterns, and (3) enhancing overall intelligent transportation system performance. DynaRoute equires predefined traffic models and adapts to dynamic network conditions using local vehicle state information. We present comprehensive simulation results demonstrating that DynaRoute maintains control and transmission performance in multiple complex scenarios while significantly improving throughput and reliability compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous-time output feedback adaptive control technique for stabilization and tracking control problems. The adaptive controller is motivated by the classical discrete-time retrospective cost adaptive control algorithm. The particle swarm optimization framework automates the adaptive algorithm's hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed controller is numerically validated in the tracking problems of a double integrator and a bicopter system and is experimentally validated in an attitude stabilization problem. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed controller is an effective technique for model-free output feedback control.</description>

      <title>Standard LSParameter Estimators Ensure Finite Convergence Time for Linear Regression Equations Under an Interval Excitation Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note we recall the little-known fact that, for linear regression equations (LRE) with intervally excited (IE) regressors, standard Least Square (LS) parameter estimators ensure finite convergence time (FCT) of the estimated parameters. The convergence time being equal to the time length needed to comply with the IE assumption. As is well-known, IE is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of the LRE-hence, it is the weakest assumption for the on-or off-line solution of the parameter estimation problem.</description>

      <title>DEKC: Data-Enable Control for Tethered Space Robot Deployment in the Presence of Uncertainty via Koopman Operator Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses the deployment of tethered space robot in the presence of unknown uncertainty. A data-enable framework called DEKC which contains offline training part and online execution part is proposed to deploy tethered space robot in the presence of uncertainty. The main idea of this work is modeling the unknown uncertainty as a dynamical system, which enables high accuracy and convergence of capturing uncertainty. The core part of proposed framework is a proxy model of uncertainty, which is derived from data-driven Koopman theory and is separated with controller design. In the offline stage, the lifting functions associated with Koopman operator are parameterized with deep neural networks. Then by solving an optimization problem, the lifting functions are learned from sampling data. In the online execution stage, the proxy model cooperates the learned lifting functions obtained in the offline phase to capture the unknown uncertainty. Then the output of proxy model is compensated to the baseline controller such that the effect of uncertainty can be attenuated or even eliminated. Furthermore, considering some scenarios in which the performance of proxy model may weaken, a receding-horizon scheme is proposed to update the proxy model online. Finally, the extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The implementation of proposed DEKC framework is publicly available at https://github.com/NPU-RCIR/DEKC.git.</description>

      <title>Learning event-triggered controllers for linear parameter-varying systems from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical behaviours in engineering applications can be approximated by linear-parameter varying (LPV) representations, but obtaining precise model knowledge to develop a control algorithm is difficult in practice. In this paper, we develop the data-driven control strategies for event-triggered LPV systems with stability verifications. First, we provide the theoretical analysis of ${\theta}$-persistence of excitation for LPV systems, which leads to the feasible data-based representations. Then, in terms of the available perturbed data, we derive the stability certificates for event-triggered LPV systems with the aid of Petersen's lemma in the sense of robust control, resulting in the computationally tractable semidefinite programmings, the feasible solutions of which yields the optimal gain schedulings. Besides, we generalize the data-driven eventtriggered LPV control methods to the scenario of reference trajectory tracking, and discuss the robust tracking stability accordingly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our theoretical derivations by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Compact Amplified Laser Power Stabilization Using Robust Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Sensor Noise Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser power instability, encompassing random jitter and slow drift, severely limits the performance of optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields, especially in large-scale OPM arrays for magnetoencephalography. Although a unified amplified laser (AL) architecture improves integration, fluctuations in the pump beam progressively degrade performance across all channels, exacerbated by environmental disturbances and system uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper presents a compact AL power stabilization approach based on an innovative dual-loop active disturbance rejection control (DLADRC) strategy, while integrating a comprehensive quantitative stability analysis through novel exponential decay estimates for extended state observers (ESOs) and control error dynamics. As validated through physical experimental results, the proposed method significantly improves AL's long-term stability with sensor noise decoupling, achieving an over 85.7% reduction in 1-hour power instability and a tenfold decrease in Allan variance for correlation times 10^2 s--10^3 s, compared to standard ADRC. Crucially, the strategy demonstrates robust effectiveness across diverse operating scenarios, enabling AL-based OPM systems to achieve their full potential in high-sensitivity biomagnetic field detection.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Waste Factor and Waste Figure with Applications to Fixed Wireless Access and Relay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential rise in energy consumption across wireless communication systems, particularly in anticipation of next-generation wireless systems, necessitates rigorous frameworks for evaluating and optimizing energy efficiency. This paper revisits and expands the concept of the Waste Factor (W), or Waste Figure (WF) in decibel scale, as a unifying metric that captures both utilized and wasted power in cascaded communication systems. Building upon its foundation in system-level power modeling, we integrate the Waste Factor into a refined formulation of the Consumption Factor (CF), the ratio of data rate to total consumed power, linking it directly to Shannon's theoretical limit on energy per bit. This analysis introduces additive energy waste into the classical energy-per-bit derivation through the Waste Factor term.
  We derive closed-form expressions for energy-per-bit expenditure in both direct and relay-assisted links and develop a decision rule to determine which communication path is more energy efficient under given conditions. While not modeled explicitly, Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can be interpreted as a special case of relay-based architectures within this unified formulation, suggesting broader applicability of the Waste Factor framework to emerging 6G use cases. The framework is then extended to a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, where uplink and downlink asymmetries, traffic directionality, and component inefficiencies are jointly considered to analyze energy-optimal deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Predictive reinforcement learning based adaptive PID controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to address the challenges of controlling unstable and nonlinear systems by proposing an adaptive PID controller based on predictive reinforcement learning (PRL-PID), where the PRL-PID combines the advantages of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Design/methodology/approach: A predictive reinforcement learning framework is introduced, incorporating action smooth strategy to suppress overshoot and oscillations, and a hierarchical reward function to support training. Findings: Experimental results show that the PRL-PID controller achieves superior stability and tracking accuracy in nonlinear, unstable, and strongly coupled systems, consistently outperforming existing RL-tuned PID methods while maintaining excellent robustness and adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Originality/Value: By adopting predictive learning, the proposed PRL-PID integrates system model priors into data-driven control, enhancing both the control framework's training efficiency and the controller's stability. As a result, PRL-PID provides a balanced blend of model-based and data-driven approaches, delivering robust, high-performance control.</description>

      <title>The Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter for State Estimation on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The invariant filtering theory based on the group theory has been successful in statistical filtering methods. However, there exists a class of state estimation problems with unknown statistical properties of noise disturbances, and it is worth discussing whether the invariant observer still has performance advantages. In this paper, considering the problem of state estimation with unknown but bounded noise disturbances, an Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter (InZSMF) method on groups is innovatively proposed, which extends the invariant filtering theory to the field of non-statistical filtering represented by set-membership filtering. Firstly, the InZSMF method transforms the state space from the traditional Euclidean vector space to the Lie group space to construct group affine discrete systems with unknown but bounded noise uncertainty defined by the zonotope on groups. Secondly, the nonlinear observer on the group is defined and the corresponding linearized estimation error is derived. Then, two observer gain tuning algorithms under the InZSMF method are proposed, respectively, the pole configuration method and the F-radius optimization method. Finally, through simulation experiments, it is shown that the InZSMF state estimation method is generally superior to the traditional Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter (ZSMF) state estimation method. Especially, when the initial estimations are imprecise, the convergence speed of state estimation, the accuracy of set-membership center estimation, and the average interval area of zonotopic estimation of the InZSMF method are significantly better than those of the ZSMF method.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-Altitude Airspace Management and UAV Operations: Requirements, Architecture and Enabling Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly advancing toward intelligence, connectivity, and coordination, bringing new challenges in dynamic airspace management, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation, and security management. Existing systems remain fragmented and lack effective coordination. To bridge these gaps, we propose UTICN (Ubiquitous and Trusted Intelligent Cellular-native Network) for LAE, a unified cellular-native architecture that integrates multi-domain sensing, high-precision positioning, intelligent aircraft-to-everything communication, dynamic airspace management, and UAV operational services. UTICN introduces key technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), passive and active positioning, intelligent machine communication, swarm coordination, and control-data decoupled management frameworks. We demonstrate UTICN's feasibility through two use cases, i.e., a city-level LAE management platform and a multi-frequency collaborative ISAC system. This work provides a fundamental reference for building a unified operational foundation and airspace management architecture for the LAE.</description>

      <title>Q-learning-based Hierarchical Cooperative Local Search for Steelmaking-continuous Casting Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steelmaking continuous casting scheduling problem (SCCSP) is a critical and complex challenge in modern steel production, requiring the coordinated assignment and sequencing of steel charges across multiple production stages. Efficient scheduling not only enhances productivity but also significantly reduces energy consumption. However, both traditional heuristics (e.g., two-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical cooperative local search framework, termed HierC_Q, aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in SCCSP. The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the intrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is proposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration process towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical architecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve (L2I) tier and the "disturb to renovate" (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep exploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based local search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy QLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local search, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are also intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem's structure. Meanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based solution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The superiority and effectiveness of HierC_Q are demonstrated through extensive comparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging based deep learning pooling for fault diagnosis in a wastewater treatment plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, water reuse is a serious challenge to help address water shortages. Here, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) play a key role, and its proper operation is mandatory. So, fault diagnosis is a key activity for these plants. Their high complexity and large-scale require of smart methodologies for that fault diagnosis and safety operation. All these large-scale and complex industrial processes are monitored, allowing the data collection about the plant operation, so data driven approaches for fault diagnosis can be applied. A popular approach to fault diagnosis is deep learning-based methodologies. Here, a fault diagnosis methodology is proposed for a WWTP using a new linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) pooling based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and a sliding and overlapping time window. This window slides over input data based on the monitoring sampling time, then the diagnosis is carried out by the linguistic OWA pooling based DCNN. This alternative linguistic pooling uses well-known linguistic OWA quantifiers, which permit terms such as \textsl{Most, AtLeast, etc.}, supplying new intuitive options for the pooling tasks. This sliding time window and the OWA pooling based network permit a better and earlier fault diagnosis, at each sampling time, using a few monitoring samples and a fewer learning iterations than DCNN standard pooling. Several linguistic OWA operators have been checked with a benchmark for WWTPs. A set of 5 fault types has been used, taking into account 140 variables sampled at 15 minutes time intervals. The performance has been over $91\%$ for $Accuracy$, $Recall$ or $F1-Score$, and better than other competitive methodologies. Moreover, these linguistic OWA operators for DCNN pooling have shown a better performance than the standard \textsl{Max} and \textsl{Average} options.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Propagation with Guarantees in Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of propagating an uncertain distribution by a possibly non-linear function and quantifying the resulting uncertainty. We measure the uncertainty using the Wasserstein distance, and for a given input set of distributions close in the Wasserstein distance, we compute a set of distributions centered at a discrete distribution that is guaranteed to contain the pushforward of any distribution in the input set. Our approach is based on approximating a nominal distribution from the input set to a discrete support distribution for which the exact computation of the pushforward distribution is tractable, thus guaranteeing computational efficiency to our approach. Then, we rely on results from semi-discrete optimal transport and distributional robust optimization to show that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the error introduced by our approach can be made smaller than $\epsilon$. Critically, in the context of dynamical systems, we show how our results allow one to efficiently approximate the distribution of a stochastic dynamical system with a discrete support distribution for a possibly infinite horizon while bounding the resulting approximation error. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our framework on various benchmarks, including a 10-D non-linear system, showing the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Vehicle Controller Parameters via Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization: From Simulation to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter tuning for vehicle controllers remains a costly and time-intensive challenge in automotive development. Traditional approaches rely on extensive real-world testing, making the process inefficient. We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization approach that efficiently learns optimal controller parameters by leveraging both low-fidelity simulation data and a very limited number of real-world experiments. Our approach significantly reduces the need for manual tuning and expensive field testing while maintaining the standard two-stage development workflow used in industry. The core contribution is the integration of an auto-regressive multi-fidelity Gaussian process model into Bayesian optimization, enabling knowledge transfer between different fidelity levels without requiring additional low-fidelity evaluations during real-world testing. We validate our approach through both simulation studies and realworld experiments. The results demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality controller performance with only very few real-world experiments, highlighting its potential as a practical and scalable solution for intelligent vehicle control tuning in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Minimal Order Recovery through Rank-adaptive Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying linear systems from noisy input-output trajectories. We introduce Thresholded Ho-Kalman, an algorithm that leverages a rank-adaptive procedure to estimate a Hankel-like matrix associated with the system. This approach optimally balances the trade-off between accurately inferring key singular values and minimizing approximation errors for the rest. We establish finite-sample Frobenius norm error bounds for the estimated Hankel matrix. Our algorithm further recovers both the system order and its Markov parameters, and we provide upper bounds for the sample complexity required to identify the system order and finite-time error bounds for estimating the Markov parameters. Interestingly, these bounds match those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms that assume prior knowledge of the system order.</description>

      <title>Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</description>

      <title>Distributed component-level modeling and control of energy dynamics in electric power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of power electronic-based technologies is transforming modern power systems into fast, nonlinear, and heterogeneous systems. Conventional modeling and control approaches, rooted in quasi-static analysis and centralized control, are inadequate for these converter-dominated systems, which operate on fast timescales and involve proprietary models of diverse components. This paper adopts and extends a previously introduced energy space modeling framework grounded in energy conservation principles to address these challenges. We generalize the notion of a port interaction variable, which encodes energy exchange between interconnected, heterogeneous components in a unified and physically intuitive manner. A multilayered distributed control architecture is proposed, wherein the nonlinear physical dynamics of each component are lifted to a higher-level linear energy space through well-defined mappings. Distributed controllers are designed in this energy space using only local states and minimal neighbor information via port interaction variables. Two control designs, energy-based feedback linearizing control (FBLC) and sliding mode control (SMC), are proven to achieve asymptotic convergence to reference outputs. The approach is validated on two systems: an inverter-controlled RLC circuit and a synchronous generator connected to a load. In both cases, energy-based control improves transient response and reduces control effort.</description>

      <title>HabSim: Architecture for modelling disruptions, propagation, detection and repair in deep space habitats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing long-term human settlements in deep space presents significant challenges. Harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature fluctuations, micrometeorite impacts, seismic activity, and exposure to solar and cosmic radiation pose obstacles to the design and operation of habitat systems. Prolonged mission duration and the vast distances from Earth introduce further complications in the form of delayed communication and limited resources, making autonomy especially desirable.
  Enabling simulation of the consequences of disruptions and their propagation through the various habitat subsystems is important for the development of autonomous and resilient space habitats. While existing simulation tools can assist in modeling some of these aspects, the integration of damage propagation, detection and repair in a computational model is rarely considered. This paper introduces and demonstrates a simulation architecture designed to model these aspects efficiently. By combining physics-based and phenomenological models, our approach balances computational efficiency with model fidelity. Furthermore, by coordinating subsystems operating at different time scales, we achieve real-time simulation capabilities.
  After describing the architecture, we demonstrate its application within HabSim, a space habitat system model developed by the NASA-funded Resilient Extraterrestrial Habitat Institute (RETHi). In these scenarios we consider fire hazard propagation within a lunar habitat to illustrate both how our architecture supports the modeling of disruption propagation, detection, and repair in a simulation environment and how the HabSim model can be leveraged for through stochastic simulations to support resilience assessment. The architecture developed herein is efficient and scalable, enabling researchers to gain insight into resilience, autonomy and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Indices for Improving Metro Load Curve, Using Distributed Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper promises the idea of using DG (Distributed Generation) to improve the Metro load curve. Public transportation systems are often based on gasoline and diesel. However, with the gradual development in usage of the Metro and monorail, a new load with heavy demand, inappropriate load curve and middle LF (Load factor) is added to the electricity grid. In addition to supply problem of this massive consumer, the Metro load curve is another problem, which has a relatively low LF. Furthermore, Metro load peak hours coincide with the peaks of national grid. Improvement of the load curve is well-known in electrical engineering literature, which depending on the type of load curve, offers general recommendations in three approaches; DSM (Demand Side Management), DS (Distributed Storage) and DG. In this paper, to achieve quantitative indices of improvement for Metro load curve using DG, firstly based on the analysis of volume and consumption pattern of the main loads in Metro, the typical load curve has been extracted. Using this curve, the result of using DG is shown by quantitative parameters which represent the significant improvement in load curve. These parameters can be used to calculate economic indicators such as initial cost and ROI (Return of Investment).</description>

      <title>Online Learning Control Strategies for Industrial Processes with Application for Loosening and Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, termed HPC-AK-MPC, designed to address the dual challenges of time-varying dynamics and safe operation in complex industrial processes. The framework integrates two core strategies: online learning and historically-informed safety constraints. To contend with process time-variance, a Recursive Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (rEDMDc) technique is employed to construct an adaptive Koopman model capable of updating its parameters from real-time data, endowing the controller with the ability to continuously learn and track dynamic changes. To tackle the critical issue of safe operation under model uncertainty, we introduce a novel Historical Process Constraint (HPC) mechanism. This mechanism mines successful operational experiences from a historical database and, by coupling them with the confidence level of the online model, generates a dynamic "safety corridor" for the MPC optimization problem. This approach transforms implicit expert knowledge into explicit, adaptive constraints, establishing a dynamic balance between pursuing optimal performance and ensuring robust safety. The proposed HPC-AK-MPC method is applied to a real-world tobacco loosening and conditioning process and systematically validated using an "advisor mode" simulation framework with industrial data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to historical operations, the proposed method significantly improves the Process Capability Index (Cpk) for key quality variables across all tested batches, proving its substantial potential in enhancing control performance while guaranteeing operational safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Per-Tree Canopy Volume Estimation Using Mobile LiDAR in Structured and Unstructured Orchards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time system for per-tree canopy volume estimation using mobile LiDAR data collected during routine robotic navigation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on static scans or assume uniform orchard structures, our method adapts to varying field geometries via an integrated pipeline of LiDAR-inertial odometry, adaptive segmentation, and geometric reconstruction. We evaluate the system across two commercial orchards, one pistachio orchard with regular spacing and one almond orchard with dense, overlapping crowns. A hybrid clustering strategy combining DBSCAN and spectral clustering enables robust per-tree segmentation, achieving 93% success in pistachio and 80% in almond, with strong agreement to drone derived canopy volume estimates. This work advances scalable, non-intrusive tree monitoring for structurally diverse orchard environments.</description>

      <title>Lite-RVFL: A Lightweight Random Vector Functional-Link Neural Network for Learning Under Concept Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL. The source code is available at https://github.com/songqiaohu/Lite-RVFL.</description>

      <title>Re4MPC: Reactive Nonlinear MPC for Multi-model Motion Planning via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom, such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.</description>

      <title>Time-Aware World Model for Adaptive Prediction and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high- and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and iterations.

      <title>The interplay of robustness and generalization in quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning, their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an application to time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reasoning for Perception, Explanation, and Autonomous Action in Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings. Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications. Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted deployment in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots. The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.</description>

      <title>Identifiable specializations for ODE models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input-output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.</description>

      <title>Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation systems is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic accidents and social events. Many established control strategies relying on mathematical models can struggle with real-world disruptions, leading to a significant deviation from their anticipated efficiency. This work applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks against disruptions. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness, resilience, and reliability as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also to thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Incorporating antifragile terms composed of traffic state derivatives and redundancy, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed and subsequently evaluated in a two-region cordon-shaped urban traffic perimeter network. Promising results highlight (a) the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods under incremental magnitude of disruptions, (b) distribution skewness as the antifragility indicator demonstrating its relative antifragility, and (c) its effectiveness under limited observability due to real-world data availability constraints. The proposed antifragile methodology is generalizable and holds potential for application beyond perimeter control, offering integration into systems exposed to disruptions across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Iterative Adaptation of Feedforward Controllers: an Application on Electromechanical Switches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromechanical switching devices such as relays, solenoid valves, and contactors offer several technical and economic advantages that make them widely used in industry. However, uncontrolled operations result in undesirable impact-related phenomena at the end of the stroke. As a solution, different soft-landing controls have been proposed. Among them, feedforward control with iterative techniques that adapt its parameters is a solution when real-time feedback is not available. However, these techniques typically require a large number of operations to converge or are computationally intensive, which limits a real implementation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the iterative adaptation that is able to eventually adapt the search coordinate system and to reduce the search dimensional size in order to accelerate convergence. Moreover, it automatically toggles between a derivative-free and a gradient-based method to balance exploration and exploitation. To demonstrate the high potential of the proposal, each novel part of the algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach via simulation.</description>

      <title>Circuit-theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation -- Balancing Optimality and AC Feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AC State Estimation (ACSE) is widely recognized as a practical approach for determining the grid states in steady-state conditions. It serves as a fundamental analysis to ensure grid security and is a reference for market dispatch. As grid complexity increases with rapid electrification and decarbonization, there is a growing need for more accurate knowledge of the grid operating state. However, existing ACSE algorithms have technical gaps. Critically, current ACSE algorithms are susceptible to erroneous system parameters, which are assumed to be fixed in traditional approaches. In this paper, we build a novel circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm to address this limitation. The innovative algorithm builds an analogous equivalent circuit of the grid with states and certain parameters unknown. It solves a circuit-constrained optimization to estimate the most likely grid states and parameters given a set of measurements. Further, it quantifies the goodness of the estimated output by formulating tight convex envelopes around the original non-convex problem to quantify the quality of estimates. We compare the various proposed approaches on systems with up to 2869 nodes while demonstrating a tradeoff between solution optimality and model fidelity.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Density-Compensating Model Predictive Control for Targeted Reentry of Drag-Modulated Spacecraft</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an estimation and control framework that enables the targeted reentry of a drag-modulated spacecraft in the presence of atmospheric density uncertainty. In particular, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the in-flight density errors relative to the atmospheric density used to generate the nominal guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged within a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to improve tracking performance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator saturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and control framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with historical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at all points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed away from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar storms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag control device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to guide the spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude with a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.</description>

      <title>Little to lose: the case for a robust European green hydrogen strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers that document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</description>

Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) means optimizing the topology of a distribution grid using switching actions. Switching actions are a degrees of freedom available to distribution system operators, e.g. to manage planned and unplanned outages. DSR is a NP-hard combinatorial problem. Finding good or even optimal solutions is computationally expensive. While transmission and high-voltage grids are generally operated in a meshed state, MV distribution systems are commonly operated as radial networks even though meshed operation would be supported. This improves resilience because faults can be isolated more easily keeping the rest of the system operational and minimizing impact on customers. We propose an AC DSR formulation and benchmark it against a common formulation from the literature. Our results indicate that additional acyclicity constraints can significantly improve solver performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a system security problem in the context of observability based on a two-person noncooperative infinitely repeated game. Both the attacker and the defender have means to modify the dimension of the unobservable subspace, which is set as the value function. Utilizing tools from geometric control, we construct the best response sets considering one-step and two-step optimality respectively to maximize or minimize the value function. We establish a unified necessary-and-sufficient condition for Nash equilibrium that holds for both one-step and two-step optimizations. Our analysis further uncovers two evolutionary patterns, lock and loop modes, and shows an asymmetry between defense and attack. The defender can lock the game into equilibrium, whereas the attacker can disrupt it by sacrificing short-term utility for longer-term advantage. Six representative numerical examples corroborate the theoretical results and highlight the complexity of possible game outcomes.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>

Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are Lipschitz bounded in subsets of n dimensional euclidean space. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.</description>

      <title>Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Synchronization: Bridging the Sim-RL Agent to a Real-Time Robotic Additive Manufacturing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning technology, it gradually demonstrates excellent potential and is becoming the most promising solution in the robotics. However, in the smart manufacturing domain, there is still not too much research involved in dynamic adaptive control mechanisms optimizing complex processes. This research advances the integration of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing processing. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm with the proposed hierarchical reward structure to address the common reinforcement learning challenges in two distinct control scenarios. The results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite-horizon optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</description>

      <title>Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.</description>
