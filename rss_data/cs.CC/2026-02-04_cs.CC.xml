      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory and the complexity of counting group homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a finite group $G$. We study the computational complexity of counting problems of the following flavor: given a group $\Gamma$, count the number of homomorphisms $\Gamma \to G$. Our first result establishes that this problem is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard whenever $G$ is a non-abelian group and $\Gamma$ is provided via a finite presentation. We give several improvements showing that this hardness conclusion continues to hold for restricted $\Gamma$ satisfying various promises. Our second result, in contrast, shows that if $G$ is class 2 nilpotent and $\Gamma = \pi_1(M^3)$ for some input 3-manifold triangulation $M^3$, then there is a polynomial time algorithm. The difference in complexity is explained by the fact that 3-manifolds are close enough to being Eilenberg-MacLane spaces for us to be able to solve the necessary group cohomological obstruction problems efficiently using the given triangulation. A similar polynomial time algorithm for counting maps to finite, class 2 nilpotent $G$ exists when $\Gamma$ is itself a finite group encoded via a multiplication table.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Monitoring Edge-geodetic Sets in Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic and Algorithmic Analyses of Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.
  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.</description>

      <title>Inapproximability of the independent set polynomial in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the independent set polynomial $Z_G(\lambda)$ of a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ when the activity $\lambda$ is a complex number. This problem is already well understood when $\lambda$ is real using connections to the $\Delta$-regular tree $T$. The key concept in that case is the "occupation ratio" of the tree $T$. This ratio is the contribution to $Z_T(\lambda)$ from independent sets containing the root of the tree, divided by $Z_T(\lambda)$ itself. If $\lambda$ is such that the occupation ratio converges to a limit, as the height of $T$ grows, then there is an FPTAS for approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. Otherwise, the approximation problem is NP-hard.
  Unsurprisingly, the case where $\lambda$ is complex is more challenging. Peters and Regts identified the complex values of $\lambda$ for which the occupation ratio of the $\Delta$-regular tree converges. These values carve a cardioid-shaped region $\Lambda_\Delta$ in the complex plane. Motivated by the picture in the real case, they asked whether $\Lambda_\Delta$ marks the true approximability threshold for general complex values $\lambda$.
  Our main result shows that for every $\lambda$ outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, the problem of approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ on graphs $G$ with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ is indeed NP-hard. In fact, when $\lambda$ is outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$ and is not a positive real number, we give the stronger result that approximating $Z_G(\lambda)$ is actually #P-hard. If $\lambda$ is a negative real number outside of $\Lambda_\Delta$, we show that it is #P-hard to even decide whether $Z_G(\lambda)&gt;0$, resolving in the affirmative a conjecture of Harvey, Srivastava and Vondrak. Our proof techniques are based around tools from complex analysis -- specifically the study of iterative multivariate rational maps.</description>

      <title>Classically Spoofing System Linear Cross Entropy Score Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, several experimental groups have claimed demonstrations of ``quantum supremacy'' or computational quantum advantage. A notable first claim by Google Quantum AI revolves around a metric called the Linear Cross Entropy Benchmarking (Linear XEB), which has been used in many quantum supremacy experiments since. The complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing Linear XEB, however, depends on the Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold (XQUATH) conjecture put forth by Aaronson and Gunn, which has been disproven for sublinear depth circuits. In the efforts on demonstrating quantum supremacy by quantum Hamiltonian simulation, a similar benchmarking metric called the System Linear Cross Entropy Score (sXES) holds firm in light of the aforementioned negative result due to its fundamental distinction with Linear XEB. Moreover, the complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing sXES rests on the System Linear Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold Assumption (sXQUATH), the formal relationship of which to XQUATH is unclear. Despite the promises offered by sXES for future demonstration of quantum supremacy, in this work we show that it can be classically simulated efficiently in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>A Cautionary Note on Quantum Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum oracle model introduced by Aaronson and Kuperberg (2007) has found a lot of use in showing oracle separations between complexity classes and cryptographic primitives. It is generally assumed that proof techniques that do not relativize with respect to quantum oracles will also not relativize with respect to classical oracles. In this note, we show that this is not the case: specifically, we show that there is a quantum oracle problem that is contained in the class QMA, but not in a class we call polyQCPH. The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical oracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also with respect to classical oracles).
  We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional oracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe our findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard oracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <title>Hardness and Tractability of T_{h+1}-Free Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of the T(h+1)-Free Edge Deletion problem. Given a graph G and integers k and h, the task is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has size at most h. The problem is NP-complete for every fixed h at least 3, while it is solvable in polynomial time for h at most 2.
  Recent work showed strong hardness barriers: the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the solution size together with the size of a feedback edge set, ruling out fixed-parameter tractability for many classical structural parameters. We significantly strengthen these negative results by proving W[1]-hardness when parameterized by the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths, the vertex deletion distance to a disjoint union of stars, or the twin cover number. These results unify and extend known hardness results for treewidth, pathwidth, and feedback vertex set, and show that several restrictive parameters, including treedepth, cluster vertex deletion number, and modular width, do not yield fixed-parameter tractability when h is unbounded.
  On the positive side, we identify parameterizations that restore tractability. We show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by cluster vertex deletion together with h, vertex deletion set into a clique and also when parameterized by neighborhood diversity together with h via an integer linear programming formulation. We further present a fixed-parameter tractable bicriteria approximation algorithm parameterized by k. Finally, we show that the problem admits fixed-parameter tractable algorithms on split graphs and interval graphs, and we establish hardness for a directed generalization even on directed acyclic graphs.</description>
