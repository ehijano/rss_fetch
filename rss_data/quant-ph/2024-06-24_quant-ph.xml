      <title>Classifying multiparticle entanglement with passive state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14584v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics as a fundamental branch of physics examines the relationships between heat, work, and energy. The maximum energy extraction can be characterized by using the passive states that has no extracted energy under any cyclic unitary process. In this paper, we focus on the concept of marginal passive state energy and derive polygon inequalities for multi-qubit entangled pure states. We show that the marginal passive state energies collectively form a convex polytope for each class of quantum states that are equivalent under SLOCC. We finally introduce multipartite passive state energy criteria to classify multipartite entanglement under SLOCC. The present result provides a thermodynamic method to witness multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Extreme Learning of molecular potential energy surfaces and force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning algorithms are expected to play a pivotal role in quantum chemistry simulations in the immediate future. One such key application is the training of a quantum neural network to learn the potential energy surface and force field of molecular systems. We address this task by using the quantum extreme learning machine paradigm. This particular supervised learning routine allows for resource-efficient training, consisting of a simple linear regression performed on a classical computer. We have tested a setup that can be used to study molecules of any dimension and is optimized for immediate use on NISQ devices with a limited number of native gates. We have applied this setup to three case studies: lithium hydride, water, and formamide, carrying out both noiseless simulations and actual implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Compared to other supervised learning routines, the proposed setup requires minimal quantum resources, making it feasible for direct implementation on quantum platforms, while still achieving a high level of predictive accuracy compared to simulations. Our encouraging results pave the way towards the future application to more complex molecules, being the proposed setup scalable.</description>

      <title>Security of Multi-User Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete-Modulated Continuous-Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional point-to-point setting of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol typically considers two directly connected remote parties that aim to establish secret keys. This work proposes a natural generalization of a well-established point-to-point discrete-modulated continuous-variable (CV) QKD protocol to the point-to-multipoint setting. We explore four different trust levels among the communicating parties and provide secure key rates for the loss-only channel and the lossy \&amp; noisy channel in the asymptotic limit. Our study shows that discrete-modulated CV-QKD is a suitable candidate to connect several dozens of users in a point-to-multipoint network, achieving high rates at a reduced cost, using off-the-shelf components employed in modern communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Missing Puzzle Pieces in the Performance Landscape of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the maximum cut and maximum independent set problems on random regular graphs, and calculate the energy densities achieved by QAOA for high regularities up to $d=100$. Such an analysis is possible because the reverse causal cones of the operators in the Hamiltonian are associated with tree subgraphs, for which efficient classical contraction schemes can be developed. We combine the QAOA analysis with state-of-the-art upper bounds on optimality for both problems. This yields novel and better bounds on the approximation ratios achieved by QAOA for large problem sizes. We show that the approximation ratios achieved by QAOA improve as the graph regularity increases for the maximum cut problem. However, QAOA exhibits the opposite behavior for the maximum independent set problem, i.e. the approximation ratios decrease with increasing regularity. This phenomenon is explainable by the overlap gap property for large $d$, which restricts local algorithms (like QAOA) from reaching near-optimal solutions with high probability. In addition, we use the QAOA parameters determined on the tree subgraphs for small graph instances, and in that way outperform classical algorithms like Goemans-Williamson for the maximum cut problem and minimal greedy for the maximum independent set problem. In this way we circumvent the parameter optimization problem and are able to derive bounds on the expected approximation ratios.</description>

      <title>A mid-circuit erasure check on a dual-rail cavity qubit using the joint-photon number-splitting regime of circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric beamsplitter coupling between them. This `joint-photon number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in two superconducting cavities. By leveraging the beamsplitter coupling already required for single-qubit gates, this scheme permits minimal connectivity between circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with a missed erasure fraction of $(9.0 \pm 0.5)\times10^{-4}$, while incurring an erasure rate of $2.92 \pm 0.01\%$ and a Pauli error rate of $0.31 \pm 0.01\%$, both of which are dominated by cavity errors.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Priors for Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers currently rely on a hybrid quantum-classical approach known as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to solve problems. Still, there are several challenges with VQAs on the classical computing side: it corresponds to a black-box optimization problem that is generally non-convex, the observations from the quantum hardware are noisy, and the quantum computing time is expensive. The first point is inherent to the problem structure; as a result, it requires the classical part of VQAs to be solved using global optimization strategies. However, there is a trade-off between cost and accuracy; typically, quantum computers return a set of bit strings, where each bitstring is referred to as a shot. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing (QC) necessitates many shots to measure the circuit accurately. Since QC time is charged per shot, reducing the number of shots yields cheaper and less accurate observations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using basic Bayesian optimization (BO) methods to globally optimize quantum circuit parameters. This work proposes two modifications to the basic BO framework to provide a shot-efficient optimization strategy for VQAs. Specifically, we provide a means to place a prior on the periodicity of the rotation angles and a framework to place a topological prior using few-shot quantum circuit observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through an ablation study, showing that using both proposed features statistically outperforms a standard BO implementation within VQAs for computational chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Derivative coupling enables genuine entanglement harvesting in causal communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that particle detectors coupled to a massless quantum field through its derivative can genuinely harvest entanglement form the field even when they are in causal contact in flat spacetime. This is particularly relevant since the derivative coupling model captures some interesting experimentally realizable systems and since the harvested entanglement peaks at full light contact.</description>

      <title>Measuring time in a timeless universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems are typically assumed to evolve relative to an external real-valued time parameter. This seemingly innocent assumption is problematic because the time parameter is not physical. For instance, it is not an observable of any physical system. In quantum theory, this problem is solved by a construction due to Page &amp; Wootters (1984), in which the universe is in a stationary state so that the external time parameter is irrelevant. Instead, a subsystem of the Page-Wootters universe will `evolve' according to the Schr\"odinger equation because it is entangled with another system, aptly called a `clock'. It is often assumed necessary for the clock to be a dynamically isolated system, as this is one of the assumptions that Page &amp; Wootters make in their original formulation. This apparently prevents the clock from being measured, as a measurement would require it to interact with another system. In this work, we show that isolation is a sufficient but not necessary condition, allowing clock time to be measured. We also discuss clock synchronisation.</description>

      <title>Thin-film quartz for high-coherence piezoelectric phononic crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric phononic crystal resonators (PCRs) are a promising platform for acoustic quantum processing, yet their performance is currently limited by coupling to an ensemble of saturable two-level system (TLS) defects within the resonator material. Motivated by its excellent bulk mechanical properties and high crystallinity, we address this by fabricating PCRs from a new substrate: thin-film quartz. At single-phonon powers and millikelvin temperatures -- requisite conditions for quantum phononic processing -- we demonstrate large internal mechanical quality factors, $Q_i &gt; 160,000$. This represents an order of magnitude improvement in single-phonon lifetimes for piezoelectric PCR. We characterize the loss channels in these devices and find that, although improved, the low-power response is still limited by coupling to a TLS bath and that a significant portion of the TLSs are associated with the aluminum coupling electrodes. To explore the high-power response we perform ringdown measurements and demonstrate high-power quality factor-frequency products $Q_i \cdot f = 1.4 \times 10^{16}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Correlated and Critical Phenomena in Multipartite Quantum Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the general assessment of non-Markovianity in multipartite open quantum systems. To this end, we elaborate on a previously introduced non-Markovian measure to formulate a finite and additive quantifier with appropriate asymptotic behavior. We then study the dynamics of two two-level atoms in a resonant cavity as a function of their interatomic distance using an exact treatment. We observe a critical behavior in the non-Markovianity in the form of a Markovian to non-Markovian transition at a finite distance and a discontinuity in the limit of infinitely close atoms. Additionally, in this limit of highly correlated dynamics, non-Markovianity can emerge when the size of the system exceeds a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Qiskit HumanEval: An Evaluation Benchmark For Quantum Code Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum programs are typically developed using quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs). The rapid advancement of quantum computing necessitates new tools to streamline this development process, and one such tool could be Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI). In this study, we introduce and use the Qiskit HumanEval dataset, a hand-curated collection of tasks designed to benchmark the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce quantum code using Qiskit - a quantum SDK. This dataset consists of more than 100 quantum computing tasks, each accompanied by a prompt, a canonical solution, a comprehensive test case, and a difficulty scale to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. We systematically assess the performance of a set of LLMs against the Qiskit HumanEval dataset's tasks and focus on the models ability in producing executable quantum code. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs for generating quantum code but also establish a new benchmark for ongoing advancements in the field and encourage further exploration and development of GenAI-driven tools for quantum code generation.</description>

      <title>Stirring the false vacuum via interacting quantized bubbles on a 5564-qubit quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False vacuum decay is a potential mechanism governing the evolution of the early Universe, with profound connections to non-equilibrium quantum physics, including quenched dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative character of the false vacuum decay and the scarcity of its experimental probes make the effect notoriously difficult to study, with many basic open questions, such as how the bubbles of true vacuum form, move and interact with each other. Here we utilize a quantum annealer with 5564 superconducting flux qubits to directly observe quantized bubble formation in real time -- the hallmark of false vacuum decay dynamics. Moreover, we develop an effective model that describes the initial bubble creation and subsequent interaction effects. We demonstrate that the effective model remains accurate in the presence of dissipation, showing that our annealer can access coherent scaling laws in driven many-body dynamics of 5564 qubits for over $1\mu$s, i.e., more than 1000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work sets the stage for exploring late-time dynamics of the false vacuum at computationally intractable system sizes, dimensionality, and topology in quantum annealer platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhancement of spoofing detection with squeezed states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quantum state discrimination theory, we derive the upper bound for spoofing detection when randomly encoding two quantum states in an electromagnetic signal. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal bound and demonstrate that it can be saturated using a pair of coherent states. We show that quantum enhancement is independent of the number of photons; therefore, the single-photon restriction is unnecessary for experimental demonstration. We also consider encoding squeezed states in the signal and show that the detection probability approaches unity if the spoofer capability is limited to coherent state generation.</description>

      <title>Pauli Check Extrapolation for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli Check Sandwiching (PCS) is an error mitigation scheme that uses pairs of parity checks to detect errors in the payload circuit. While increasing the number of check pairs improves error detection, it also introduces additional noise to the circuit and exponentially increases the required sampling size. To address these limitations, we propose a novel error mitigation scheme, Pauli Check Extrapolation (PCE), which integrates PCS with an extrapolation technique similar to Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). However, instead of extrapolating to the `zero-noise' limit, as is done in ZNE, PCE extrapolates to the `maximum check' limit--the number of check pairs theoretically required to achieve unit fidelity. In this study, we focus on applying a linear model for extrapolation and also derive a more general exponential ansatz based on the Markovian error model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PCE by using it to mitigate errors in the shadow estimation protocol, particularly for states prepared by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that this method can achieve higher fidelities than the state-of-the-art Robust Shadow (RS) estimation scheme, while significantly reducing the number of required samples by eliminating the need for a calibration procedure. We validate these findings on both fully-connected topologies and simulated IBM hardware backends.</description>

      <title>Predicting atmospheric turbulence for secure quantum communications in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence is the main barrier to large-scale free-space quantum communication networks. Aberrations distort optical information carriers, thus limiting or preventing the possibility of establishing a secure link between two parties. For this reason, forecasting the turbulence strength within an optical channel is highly desirable, as it allows for knowing the optimal timing to establish a secure link in advance. Here, we train a Recurrent Neural Network, TAROCCO, to predict the turbulence strength within a free-space channel. The training is based on weather and turbulence data collected over 9 months for a 5.4 km intra-city free-space link across the City of Ottawa. The implications of accurate predictions from our network are demonstrated in a simulated high-dimensional Quantum Key Distribution protocol based on orbital angular momentum states of light across different turbulence regimes. TAROCCO will be crucial in validating a free-space channel to optimally route the key exchange for secure communications in real experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Qrisp: A Framework for Compilable High-Level Programming of Gate-Based Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made on the hardware side of quantum computing, support for high-level quantum programming abstractions remains underdeveloped compared to classical programming languages. In this article, we introduce Qrisp, a framework designed to bridge several gaps between high-level programming paradigms in state-of-the-art software engineering and the physical reality of today's quantum hardware. The framework aims to provide a systematic approach to quantum algorithm development such that they can be effortlessly implemented, maintained and improved. We propose a number of programming abstractions that are inspired by classical paradigms, yet consistently focus on the particular needs of a quantum developer. Unlike many other high-level language approaches, Qrisp's standout feature is its ability to compile programs to the circuit level, making them executable on most existing physical backends. The introduced abstractions enable the Qrisp compiler to leverage algorithm structure for increased compilation efficiency. Finally, we present a set of code examples, including an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm. For the latter, the resulting circuit shows significantly reduced quantum resource requirements, strongly supporting the claim that systematic quantum algorithm development can give quantitative benefits.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Collective Emission of Giant emitters in the Zeno Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the collective Zeno dynamics of giant artificial atoms that are coupled, via multiple coupling points, to a common photonic or acoustic reservoir. In this regime, the establishment of atomic cooperativity and the revivification of exponential decay, are highly intertwined, which is utterly beyond the non-Markovian regime with only retarded backaction. We reveal that giant atoms build up their collective emission smoothly from the decay rate of zero to that predicted by Markovian approximation, and show great disparity between different waveguide QED setups. As a comparison, the step-like growth of instantaneous decay rates in the retardation-only picture has also been shown. All of these theoretical pictures predict the same collective behavior in the long time limit. From a phenomenological standpoint, we observe that the atomic superradiance exhabits significant directional property. In addition, the subradiant photons feature prolonged oscillation in the early stage of collective radiance, where the energy is exchanged remarkably between giant emitters and the field. Our results might be probed in state-of-art waveguide QED experiments, and fundamentally broaden the fields of collective emission in systems with giant atoms.</description>

      <title>Fano-enhanced low-loss on-chip superconducting microwave circulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrite-free circulators that are passive and readily integratable on a chip are highly sought-after in quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. In our previous work, we implemented such a circulator using a three-Josephson-junction loop that exhibited unambiguous nonreciprocity and signal circulation, but required junction energies to be within $1\%$ of design values. This tolerance is tighter than standard junction fabrication methods provide, so we propose and demonstrate a design improvement that relaxes the required junction fabrication precision, allowing for higher device performance and fabrication yield. Specifically, we introduce large direct capacitive couplings between the waveguides to create strong Fano scattering interference. We measure enhanced `circulation fidelity' above $97\%$, with optimised on-resonance insertion loss of $0.2$~dB, isolation of $18$~dB, and power reflectance of $-15$~dB, in good agreement with model calculations.</description>

      <title>Verifying Hierarchic Multipartite and Network Nonlocalities with a Unified Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipartite nonlocality provides deep insights into the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and guarantees different degrees of cryptography security for potential applications in the quantum internet. Verifying multipartite nonlocal correlations is a difficult task. We propose a unified approach that encompasses all the quantum characteristics of the multipartite correlated system beyond from fully separable to biseparable no-signaling correlations. We offer a straightforward method to verify general systems by lifting partial nonlocal correlations. This allows to construct a chained Bell inequality, facilitating the unified verification of hierarchic multipartite nonlocalities. We finally apply the lifting method to verify the correlations derived from quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on quantum uncommon information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum uncommon information signifies information that two parties do not share in common. Despite the long-standing challenge of deriving a closed-form expression for quantum uncommon information, significant progress has remained elusive. In this work, we present new bounds on quantum uncommon information using a subspace exchange strategy and a referee-assisted quantum exchange task. Both techniques offer improved bounds compared to previous methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these bounds through non-trivial examples. Our results have broader applications in various scenarios, particularly, the subspace technique is a versatile tool for the characterization of uncommon information in multi-party scenarios.</description>

      <title>Identifying impurities in a silicon substrate by using a superconducting flux qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bismuth-doped silicon substrate was analyzed by using a magnetometer based on a superconducting flux qubit. The temperature dependence of the magnetization indicates that the silicon substrate contains at least two signal sources, intentionally doped bismuth spins and a spin 1/2 system with a ratio of 0.873 to 0.127. In combination with a conventional electron spin resonance spectrometer, a candidate origin of the spin 1/2 system was identified as a dangling bond on the silicon surface. In addition, the spin sensitivity of the magnetometer was also estimated to be 12 spins/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by using optimized dispersive readout.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated quantum gates for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic particle inductively coupled to two superconducting transmon qubits, where qubit-qubit interactions are mediated via magnons. We show that the system can be tuned into three different regimes of effective qubit-qubit interactions, namely a transverse ($XX + YY$), a longitudinal ($ZZ$) and a non-trivial $ZX$ interaction. In addition, we show that an enhanced coupling can be achieved by employing an ellipsoidal magnet, carrying anisotropic magnetic fluctuations. We propose a scheme for realizing two-qubit gates, and simulate their performance under realistic experimental conditions. We find that iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed in this setup with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 99 \% $ , while an iCNOT gate can be applied with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 88 \%$. Our proposed hybrid circuit architecture offers an alternative platform for realizing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits and could be employed for constructing qubit networks using magnons as mediators.</description>

      <title>A blindness property of the Min-Sum decoding for the toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code is one of the most prominent models for fault-tolerant quantum computation, currently regarded as the leading solution for connectivity constrained quantum technologies. Significant effort has been recently devoted to improving the error correction performance of the toric code under message-passing decoding, a class of low-complexity, iterative decoding algorithms that play a central role in both theory and practice of classical low-density parity-check codes. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of the toric code under min-sum (MS) decoding, a message-passing decoding algorithm known to solve the maximum-likelihood decoding problem in a localized manner, for codes defined by acyclic graphs. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic limitation of the toric code, which confines the propagation of local information during the message-passing process. We show that if the unsatisfied checks of an error syndrome are at distance greater or equal to 5 from each other, then the MS decoding is locally blind: the qubits in the direct neighborhood of an unsatisfied check are never aware of any other unsatisfied checks, except their direct neighbor. Moreover, we show that degeneracy is not the only cause of decoding failures for errors of weight at least 4, that is, the MS non-degenerate decoding radius is equal to 3, for any toric code of distance greater or equal to 9. Finally, complementing our theoretical analysis, we present a pre-processing method of practical relevance. The proposed method, referred to as stabiliser-blowup, has linear complexity and allows correcting all (degenerate) errors of weight up to 3, providing quadratic improvement in the logical error rate performance, as compared to MS only.</description>

      <title>An inhomogeneous adiabatic preparation of a quantum critical ground state in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</description>

      <title>Giant caloric effects in spin chain materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant electro- and elasto-caloric effects in spin chain materials are predicted. The theory is based on the exact quantum mechanical solution of the problem. It is shown that the giant jumps in the entropy and the temperature caused by the caloric effect are weakly affected by the initial temperature. The effect can be used for the cooling of new quantum devices (like systems of qubits in quantum computers). On the other hand, since large changes are predicted in the narrow neighborhood of the critical point, the predicted effect can be used in ultra-sensitive electric and stress sensors for modern microelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on probabilities in channel measurements on qubit channels and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in quantum information processing is to measure the quantum channels. Similar to measurements of quantum states, measurements of quantum channels are inherently stochastic, that is, quantum theory provides a formula to calculate the probability of obtaining an outcome. The upper bound on each probability associated with the measurement outcome of the quantum channels is a fundamental and important quantity. In this study, we derived the upper bounds of the probability in a channel measurement for specific classes of quantum channels. We also present two applications for the upper bounds. The first is the notion of convertibility considered by Alberti and Uhlmann and the second is the detection problem of a quantum channel. These applications demonstrate the significance of the obtained upper bounds.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Min-Entropy Calculation And Its Application To Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum Shannon theory, various kinds of quantum entropies are used to characterize the capacities of noisy physical systems. Among them, min-entropy and its smooth version attract wide interest especially in the field of quantum cryptography as they can be used to bound the information obtained by an adversary. However, calculating the exact value or non-trivial bounds of min-entropy are extremely difficult because the composite system dimension may scale exponentially with the dimension of its subsystem. Here, we develop a one-shot lower bound calculation technique for the min-entropy of a classical-quantum state that is applicable to both finite and infinite dimensional reduced quantum states. Moreover, we show our technique is of practical interest in at least two situations. First, it gives an alternative tight finite-data analysis for the well-known BB84 quantum key distribution protocol. More importantly, it provides a security proof for a novel source-independent continuous-variable quantum random number generation protocol. These show the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Solving the Product Breakdown Structure Problem with constrained QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems, where not all possible variable assignments are feasible solutions, comprise numerous practically relevant optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), or portfolio optimization. Established methods such as quantum annealing or vanilla QAOA usually transform the problem statement into a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) form, where the constraints are enforced by auxiliary terms in the QUBO objective. Consequently, such approaches fail to utilize the additional structure provided by the constraints. In this paper, we present a method for solving the industry relevant Product Breakdown Structure problem. Our solution is based on constrained QAOA, which by construction never explores the part of the Hilbert space that represents solutions forbidden by the problem constraints. The size of the search space is thereby reduced significantly. We experimentally show that this approach has not only a very favorable scaling behavior, but also appears to suppress the negative effects of Barren Plateaus.</description>

      <title>Quantum battery supercharging via counter-diabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a counter-diabatic approach for deriving Hamiltonians modeling superchargable quantum batteries (QBs). A necessary requirement for the supercharging process is the existence of multipartite interactions among the cells of the battery. Remarkably, this condition may be insufficient no matter the number of multipartite terms in the Hamiltonian. We analytically illustrate this kind of insufficiency through a model of QB based on the adiabatic version for the Grover search problem. On the other hand, we provide QB supercharging with just a mild number of global connections in the system. To this aim, we consider a spin-$1/2$ chain with $n$ sites in the presence of Ising multipartite interactions. We then show that, by considering the validity of the adiabatic approximation and by adding $n$ terms of $(n-1)$-site interactions, we can achieve a Hamiltonian exhibiting maximum QB power, with respect to a normalized evolution time, growing quadratically with $n$. Therefore, supercharging can be achieved by $O(n)$ terms of multipartite connections. The time constraint required by the adiabatic approximation can be surpassed by considering a counter-diabatic expansion in terms of the gauge potential for the original Hamiltonian, with a limited $O(n)$ many-body interaction terms assured via a Floquet approach for the counter-diabatic implementation.</description>

      <title>State Transfer and Readout Times for Trees of Diameter 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the state transfer properties of continuous time quantum walks on trees of diameter 4. We characterize all pairs of strongly cospectral vertices in trees of diameter 4, finding that they fall into pairs of three different types. For each type, we construct an infinite family of diameter 4 trees for which there is pretty good state transfer between the pair of strongly cospectral vertices. Moreover, for two of those types, for each tree in the infinite family, we give an explicit sequence of readout times at which the fidelity of state transfer converges to $1$. For strongly cospectral vertices of the remaining type, we identify a sequence of trees and explicit readout times so that the fidelity of state transfer between the strongly cospectral vertices approaches $1.$
  We also prove a result of independent interest: for a graph with the property that the fidelity of state transfer between a pair of vertices at time $t_k$ converges to $1$ as $k \rightarrow \infty,$ then the derivative of the fidelity at $t_k$ converges to $0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty. $</description>

      <title>High photon-number efficiencies with a fast 28-pixel parallel SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their inception, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors have been enabling quantum optical applications and the rise of the photonic quantum industry. The evolution in the detector design and read-out strategies has led to the introduction of devices with a plurality of independent pixels, which have been able to operate with high system detection efficiency at high speed while also supporting photon number resolution capabilities. However, this comes at the cost of a complex readout that requires one coaxial cable for each pixel of the array. Here, we report a 28-pixel SNSPD with a dedicated parallel architecture that, while maintaining a simple readout with a single coaxial line, enables the detector to operate at high speed with low-performance degradation. The device shows a maximum single-photon efficiency (SDE) of 88% and is able to maintain its SDE above 50%, coupled with a timing jitter lower than 80~ps, up to a detection rate of 200 million counts per second (Mcps). The detector also provides state-of-the-art PNR performances with a 2-photon efficiency of 75% and a 3-photon efficiency of 60%.</description>

      <title>Inter-pixel cross-talk as background to two-photon interference effects in SPAD arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-talk is a well-known feature of single-photon avalanche detectors. It is especially important to account for this effect in applications involving coincidences of two or more photons registered by the sensor since in this case the cross-talk may mimic the useful signal. In this work, we characterize the cross-talk of the LinoSPAD2 detector, as well as perform joint measurements of the cross-talk and Hanbury Brown - Twiss two-photon interference, comparing and cross-calibrating both effects. With a median dark count rate of 125 cps/pixel, we report the average cross-talk probability of $0.22~\%$ for the nearest neighbor and also observe a long-range cross-talk of the order $2 \cdot 10^{-5}~\%$ for channels separated by up to 20 pixels.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing Enhanced Quantum Magnetometry with Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the utility of quantum spin squeezing in quantum magnetometry, focusing on three-level (qutrit) Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers within diamond, utilizing a standard Ramsey interferometry pulse protocol. Our investigation incorporates the effects of dephasing and relaxation on NV centers' dynamics during Ramsey measurements, modeled via the Lindblad quantum master equation. We conduct a comparative analysis between the metrological capabilities of a single NV center and a pair of NV centers, considering Quantum Fisher Information both with and without spin squeezing. The quantum correlations between NV centers are assessed through the evaluation of the Kitagawa-Ueda spin squeezing parameter within a two-level manifold. Additionally, parallel calculations are conducted using a two-level model (qubit) for NV centers. Our findings reveal that leveraging qutrits and spin squeezing yields enhanced magnetometric precision, albeit constrained by dephasing effects. Nevertheless, even in the absence of dynamical decoupling methods to mitigate environmental noise, strategic timing of squeezing and free evolution can sustain the advantages of qutrit-based magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of a potential biological magnetic field sensor: radical pair mechanism in flavin adenine dinucleotide biradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) on its own might be able to act as a biological magnetic field sensor. Motivated by these observations, in this study, we develop a detailed quantum theoretical model for the radical pair mechanism (RPM) for the flavin adenine biradical within the FAD molecule. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the distance between the radicals on FAD, which we then feed into a quantum master equation treatment of the RPM. In contrast to previous semi-classical models which are limited to the low-field and high-field cases, our quantum model can predict the full magnetic field dependence of the transient absorption signal. Our model's predictions are consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>QuIP: A P4 Quantum Internet Protocol Prototyping Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is so fundamentally different from a network packet that several quantum network stacks have been proposed; one of which has even been experimentally demonstrated. Several simulators have also been developed to make up for limited hardware availability, and which facilitate the design and evaluation of quantum network protocols. However, the lack of shared tooling and community-agreed node architectures has resulted in protocol implementations that are tightly coupled to their simulators. Besides limiting their reusability between different simulators, it also makes building upon prior results and simulations difficult. To address this problem, we have developed QuIP: a P4-based Quantum Internet Protocol prototyping framework for quantum network protocol design. QuIP is a framework for designing and implementing quantum network protocols in a platform-agnostic fashion. It achieves this by providing the means to flexibly, but rigorously, define device architectures against which quantum network protocols can be implemented in the network programming language P4$_{16}$. QuIP also comes with the necessary tooling to enable their execution in existing quantum network simulators. We demonstrate its use by showcasing V1Quantum, a completely new device architecture, implementing a link- and network-layer protocol, and simulating it in the existing simulator NetSquid.</description>

      <title>Some new infinite families of non-$p$-rational real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a finite collection of primes $\{ p_j \}$, not containing $2$ or $3$. Using some observations which arose from attempts to solve the SIC-POVMs problem in quantum information, we give a simple methodology for constructing an infinite family of simultaneously non-$p_j$-rational real quadratic fields, unramified above any of the $p_j$. Alternatively these may be described as infinite sequences of instances of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$, for varying $D$, where every $p_j$ is a $k$-Wall-Sun-Sun prime, or equivalently a generalised Fibonacci-Wieferich prime.
  One feature of these techniques is that they may be used to yield fields $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ for which a $p$-power cyclic component of the torsion group of the Galois groups of the maximal abelian pro-$p$-extension of $K$ unramified outside primes above $p$, is of size $p^a$ for $a\geq1$ arbitrarily large.</description>

Abstract: We study pair creation out of the vacuum, for a system consisting of a massive Dirac field in $1+1$ dimensions, contained between a pair of perfectly reflecting boundaries, one of them oscillating. After analyzing some general properties of the vacuum-decay process, we evaluate the corresponding transition amplitude in a Magnus expansion of the S-matrix. We show how this yields, besides the single-pair creation amplitude, multipair ones, as well as corrections to the single pair amplitude.
  We also apply it to obtain an approximate, yet explicitly unitary expression for the Bogoliubov transformation between the in and out Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory, which emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled, possesses eight types of relativistic particles whose mass spectrum and scattering matrices are organized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ algebra. It is predicted that all odd-parity particles are dark and cannot be directly excited from the ground state. This makes these dark particles hard to be detected. Here, we study the local dynamical spin structure factor of the model at low-frequencies and low-temperatures. In contrast to the invisibility of the dark particles in THz spectroscopy or inelastic neutron scattering measurement, we find that the lightest dark particle is detectable, manifested as a thermal activation gap in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of a controlled conical geometry on the electric charge transport through a two-dimensional quantum ring weakly coupled to both the emitter and the collector. These mesoscopic systems are known for being able to confine highly mobile electrons in a defined region of matter. Particularly, we consider a GaAs device having an average radius of $800\hspace{0.05cm}\text{nm}$ in different regimes of subband occupation at non-zero temperature and under the influence of a weak and uniform background magnetic field. Using the adapted Landauer formula for the resonant tunneling and the energy eigenvalues, we explore how the modified surface affects the Van-Hoove conductance singularities and the magnetoresistance interference patterns resulting from the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of different frequencies. Magnetoresistance oscillations depending only on the curvature intensity are reported, providing a new feature that represents an alternative way to optimize the transport through the device by tuning its geometry.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum nanophotonics has forged a rich nexus of nanotechnology with photonic quantum information processing, offering remarkable prospects for advancing quantum technologies beyond their current technical limits in terms of physical compactness, energy efficiency, operation speed, temperature robustness and scalability. In this perspective, we highlight a number of recent studies that reveal the especially compelling potential of nanoplasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics for driving quantum technologies down to nanoscale spatial and ultrafast temporal regimes, whilst elevating them to ambient temperatures. Our perspective encompasses innovative proposals for quantum plasmonic biosensing, driving ultrafast single-photon emission and achieving near-field multipartite entanglement in the strong coupling regime, with a notable emphasis on the use of industry-grade devices. We conclude with an outlook emphasizing how the bespoke characteristics and functionalities of plasmonic devices are shaping contemporary research directives in ultrafast and room-temperature quantum nanotechnologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening the bandgap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic vapour cells are an indispensable tool for quantum technologies (QT), but potential improvements are limited by the capacities of conventional manufacturing methods. Using an additive manufacturing (AM) technique - vat polymerisation by digital light processing - we demonstrate, for the first time, a 3D-printed glass vapour cell. The exploitation of AM capacities allows intricate internal architectures, overprinting of 2D optoelectronical materials to create integrated sensors and surface functionalisation, while also showing the ability to tailor the optical properties of the AM glass by in-situ growth of gold nanoparticles. The produced cells achieve ultra-high vacuum of $2 \times 10^{-9}$ mbar and enable Doppler-free spectroscopy; we demonstrate laser frequency stabilisation as a QT application. These results highlight the transformative role that AM can play for QT in enabling compact, optimised and integrated multi-material components and devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description for the driven-dissipative dynamics of the entanglement negativity, which quantifies the genuine entanglement in mixed-state systems. We focus on quantum quenches in fermionic and bosonic systems subject to linear dissipation, as described by quadratic Lindblad master equations. In the spirit of hydrodynamics, we divide the system into mesoscopic cells. At early times, correlations are generated in each cell by the unitary component of the evolution. Correlations are then transported across different cells via ballistic quasiparticle propagation, while simultaneously evolving under the action of the environment. We show that in the hydrodynamic limit the negativity can be reconstructed from the correlations between the independently propagating quasiparticles. We benchmark our approach considering quenches from both homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial states in the Kitaev chain, the tight-binding chain, and the harmonic chain in the presence of gain/loss dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation (QC) and simulation rely on long-lived qubits with controllable interactions. Early work in quantum computing made use of molecules because of their readily available intramolecular nuclear spin coupling and chemical shifts, along with mature nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Subsequently, the pursuit of many physical platforms has flourished. Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here, we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ NaCs molecules. We characterize the innate dipolar interaction between rotational states and control its strength by tuning the polarization of the traps. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 $\mu$s at a distance of 1.9 $\mu$m, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)\%, following postselection to remove trials with empty traps. Using motion-rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an iSWAP gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor platforms are emerging as a promising architecture for storing and processing quantum information, e.g., in quantum dot spin qubits. However, charge noise coming from interactions between the electrons is a major limiting factor, along with the scalability of many qubits, for a quantum computer. We show that a magnetic field gradient can be implemented in a semiconductor quantum dot array to induce a local quantum coherent dynamical $\ell-$bit exhibiting the potential to be used as logical qubits. These dynamical $\ell-$bits are responsible for the model being many-body localized. We show that these dynamical $\ell-$bits and the corresponding many-body localization are protected from all noises, including phonons, for sufficiently long times if electron-phonon interaction is not non-local. We further show the implementation of thermalization-based self-correcting logical gates. This thermalization-based error correction goes beyond the standard paradigm of decoherence-free and noiseless subsystems. Our work thus opens a new venue for passive quantum error correction in semiconductor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than $2\times3$. In this study, we use deep convolutional NNs, a type of supervised machine learning, to identify quantum entanglement for any bipartition in a 3-qubit system. We demonstrate that training the model on synthetically generated datasets of random density matrices excluding challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), which cannot be identified (and correctly labeled) in general, leads to good model accuracy even for PPTES states, that were outside the training data. Our aim is to enhance the model's generalization on PPTES. By applying entanglement-preserving symmetry operations through a triple Siamese network trained in a semi-supervised manner, we improve the model's accuracy and ability to recognize PPTES. Moreover, by constructing an ensemble of Siamese models, even better generalization is observed, in analogy with the idea of finding separate types of entanglement witnesses for different classes of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04278v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial prerequisite for quantum technologies. Therefore, the robust generation, as autonomous as possible, of quantum coherence remains the essential problem for developing this field. We consider a method of synthesizing and multiplexing quantum coherence from spin systems without any direct drives only coupled to bosonic baths. The previous studies in this field have demonstrated that a back-action of the bath to the spin subsystem is important to generate it, however, it simultaneously gives significant limits to the generated coherence. We propose a viable approach with the bosonic bath that allows overcoming these limits by avoiding the destructive effect of the back-action processes. Using this approach, we suggest an advanced synthesis of the quantum coherence non-perturbatively in the spin-boson coupling parameters of multiple bosonic baths to increase and multiplex it for upcoming proof-of-principle experiments.</description>

      <title>Entangled states dynamics of moving two-level atoms in a thermal field bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-level atom that follows a wordline of constant velocity, while interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state through: (i) an Unruh-DeWitt coupling, and (ii) a coupling that involves the time derivative of the field. We treat the atom as an open quantum system, with the field playing the role of the environment, and employ a master equation to describe its time evolution. We study the dynamics of entanglement between the moving atom and a (auxiliary) qubit at rest and isolated from the thermal field. We find that in the case of the standard Unruh-DeWitt coupling and for high temperatures of the environment the decay of entanglement is delayed due to the atom's motion. Instead, in the derivative coupling case, the atom's motion always causes the rapid death of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Reduction of finite sampling noise in quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) use parameterized quantum circuits with data-dependent inputs and generate outputs through the evaluation of expectation values. Calculating these expectation values necessitates repeated circuit evaluations, thus introducing fundamental finite-sampling noise even on error-free quantum computers. We reduce this noise by introducing the variance regularization, a technique for reducing the variance of the expectation value during the quantum model training. This technique requires no additional circuit evaluations if the QNN is properly constructed. Our empirical findings demonstrate the reduced variance speeds up the training and lowers the output noise as well as decreases the number of necessary evaluations of gradient circuits. This regularization method is benchmarked on the regression of multiple functions and the potential energy surface of water. We show that in our examples, it lowers the variance by an order of magnitude on average and leads to a significantly reduced noise level of the QNN. We finally demonstrate QNN training on a real quantum device and evaluate the impact of error mitigation. Here, the optimization is feasible only due to the reduced number of necessary shots in the gradient evaluation resulting from the reduced variance.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-Quantum Transfer Learning Facilitates Machine Learning with Variational Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an exciting emerging area, the accuracy of the loss function still needs to be improved by the number of available qubits. Here, we reformulate the QML problem such that the approximation error (representation power) does not depend on the number of qubits. We prove that a classical-to-quantum transfer learning architecture using a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) improves the representation and generalization (estimation error) capabilities of the VQC model. We derive analytical bounds for the approximation and estimation error. We show that the architecture of classical-to-quantum transfer learning leverages pre-trained classical generative AI models, making it easier to find the optimal parameters for the VQC in the training stage. To validate our theoretical analysis, we perform experiments on single-dot and double-dot binary classification tasks for charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dots, where the related empirical results support our theoretical findings. Our analytical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of classical-to-quantum transfer learning architecture in realistic tasks. This sets the stage for accelerating QML applications beyond the current limits of available qubits.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Telecom Entangled Photons through a 7.7 km Antiresonant Hollow-Core Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State of the art classical and quantum communication rely on standard optical fibers with solid cores to transmit light over long distances. However, recent advances have led to the emergence of antiresonant hollow-core optical fibers (AR-HCFs), which due to the novel fiber geometry, show remarkable optical guiding properties, which are not as limited by the material properties as solid-core fibers. In this paper, we explore the transmission of entangled photons through a novel 7.7 km AR-HCF in a laboratory environment at 1550 nm, presenting the first successful demonstration of entanglement distribution via a long AR-HCF. In addition to showing these novel fibers are compatible with long distance quantum communication, we highlight the low latency and low chromatic dispersion intrinsic to AR-HCF, which can increase the secure key rate in time-bin based quantum key distribution protocols.</description>

      <title>Geometry of entanglement and separability in Hilbert subspaces of dimension up to three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of the geometry of the mutually complementary sets of entangled and separable states in three-dimensional Hilbert subspaces of bipartite and multipartite quantum systems. Our analysis begins by finding the geometric structure of the pure product states in a given three-dimensional Hilbert subspace, which determines all the possible separable and entangled mixed states over the same subspace. In bipartite systems, we characterise the 14 possible qualitatively different geometric shapes for the set of separable states in any three-dimensional Hilbert subspace (5 classes which also appear in two-dimensional subspaces and were found and analysed by Boyer, Liss and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95:032308, 2017], and 9 novel classes which appear only in three-dimensional subspaces), describe their geometries, and provide figures illustrating them. We also generalise these results to characterise the sets of fully separable states (and hence the complementary sets of somewhat entangled states) in three-dimensional subspaces of multipartite systems. Our results show which geometrical forms quantum entanglement can and cannot take in low-dimensional subspaces.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant hyperbolic Floquet quantum error correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central goal in quantum error correction is to reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing by increasing noise thresholds and reducing the number of physical qubits required to sustain a logical qubit. We introduce a potential path towards this goal based on a family of dynamically generated quantum error correcting codes that we call "hyperbolic Floquet codes.'' These codes are defined by a specific sequence of non-commuting two-body measurements arranged periodically in time that stabilize a topological code on a hyperbolic manifold with negative curvature. We focus on a family of lattices for $n$ qubits that, according to our prescription that defines the code, provably achieve a finite encoding rate $(1/8+2/n)$ and have a depth-3 syndrome extraction circuit. Similar to hyperbolic surface codes, the distance of the code at each time-step scales at most logarithmically in $n$. The family of lattices we choose indicates that this scaling is achievable in practice. We develop and benchmark an efficient matching-based decoder that provides evidence of a threshold near 0.1% in a phenomenological noise model and 0.25% in an entangling measurements noise model. Utilizing weight-two check operators and a qubit connectivity of 3, one of our hyperbolic Floquet codes uses 400 physical qubits to encode 52 logical qubits with a code distance of 8, i.e., it is a $[[400,52,8]]$ code. At small error rates, comparable logical error suppression to this code requires 5x as many physical qubits (1924) when using the honeycomb Floquet code with the same noise model and decoder.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Communication Advantage in Distributed Inference and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training and inference with large machine learning models that far exceed the memory capacity of individual devices necessitates the design of distributed architectures, forcing one to contend with communication constraints. We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Our results can be combined with natural privacy advantages in the communicated quantum states that limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a strategy to develop optimally designed fields for continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD). Our methodology obtains the optimal continuous field configuration to maximize the fidelity of a general one-qubit quantum gate. To achieve this, considering dephasing-noise perturbations, we employ an auxiliary qubit instead of the boson bath to implement a purification scheme, which results in unitary dynamics. Employing the sub-Riemannian geometry framework for the two-qubit unitary group, we derive and numerically solve the geodesic equations, obtaining the optimal time-dependent control Hamiltonian. Also, due to the extended time required to find solutions to the geodesic equations, we train a neural network on a subset of geodesic solutions, enabling us to promptly generate the time-dependent control Hamiltonian for any desired gate, which is crucial in circuit optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In covert target detection, Alice attempts to send optical or microwave probes to determine the presence or absence of a weakly-reflecting target embedded in thermal background radiation within a target region, while striving to remain undetected by an adversary, Willie, who is co-located with the target and collects all light that does not return to Alice. We formulate this problem in a realistic setting and derive quantum-mechanical limits on Alice's error probability performance in entanglement-assisted target detection for any fixed level of her detectability by Willie. We demonstrate how Alice can approach this performance limit using two-mode squeezed vacuum probes in the regime of small to moderate background brightness, and how such protocols can outperform any conventional approach using Gaussian-distributed coherent states. In addition, we derive a universal performance bound for non-adversarial quantum illumination without requiring the passive-signature assumption.</description>

Abstract: A physical system is determined by a finite set of initial conditions and "laws" represented by equations. The system is computable if we can solve the equations in all instances using a "finite body of mathematical knowledge". In this case, if the laws of the system can be coded into a computer program, then given the initial conditions of the system, one can compute the system's evolution. Are there incomputable physical systems? This question has been theoretically studied in the last 30-40 years. In this paper, we experimentally show for the first time the strong incomputability of a quantum experiment, namely the outputs of a quantum random number generator. Moreover, the experimental results are robust and statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal protocols in Bayesian quantum parameter estimation with higher-order operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum systems as sensors or probes has been shown to greatly improve the precision of parameter estimation by exploiting unique quantum features such as entanglement. A major task in quantum sensing is to design the optimal protocol, i.e., the most precise one. It has been solved for some specific instances of the problem, but in general even numerical methods are not known. Here, we focus on the single-shot Bayesian setting, where the goal is to find the optimal initial state of the probe (which can be entangled with an auxiliary system), the optimal measurement, and the optimal estimator function. We leverage the formalism of higher-order operations to develop a method based on semidefinite programming that finds a protocol that is close to the optimal one with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is not restricted to any specific quantum evolution, cost function or prior distribution, and thus can be applied to any estimation problem. Moreover, it can be applied to both single or multiparameter estimation tasks. We demonstrate our method with three examples, consisting of unitary phase estimation, thermometry in a bosonic bath, and multiparameter estimation of an SU(2) transformation. Exploiting our methods, we extend several results from the literature. For example, in the thermometry case, we find the optimal protocol at any finite time and quantify the usefulness of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Spreading information in physical systems is a common phenomenon. However, when the information is quantum in nature, tracking, describing, and quantifying the information is a challenging task. Quantum information scrambling defines the quantum information propagating chaotically over the physical system. This article describes the effect of quantum information scrambling on bound entangled states. A bound entangled state is a particular type of entangled state that carries noisy entanglement. The distillation of this type of entangled state is very difficult. In recent times, the usefulness of these states has been depicted in different applications. The outcome of this study exhibits that quantum information scrambling develops entanglement in the separable portion of the bound entangled states. Although quantum information scrambling reduces entanglement, the study pointed out that quantum information scrambling plays a significant role in activating the bound entangled states by introducing a certain amount of approximately stable entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Realizing nonabelian topological orders and their anyon excitations is an esteemed objective. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards this goal: quantum simulating topological orders in the doubled Hilbert space - the space of density matrices. We show that ground states of all quantum double models (toric code being the simplest example) can be efficiently prepared in the doubled Hilbert space; only finite-depth local operations are needed. In contrast, this is not the case in the conventional Hilbert space: Ground states of only some of these models are known to be efficiently preparable. Additionally, we find that nontrivial anyon braiding effects, both abelian and nonabelian, can be realized in the doubled Hilbert space, although the intrinsic nature of density matrices restricts possible excitations.</description>

Abstract: Interfacing cold atoms with integrated nanophotonic devices could offer new paradigms for engineering atom-light interactions and provide a potentially scalable route for quantum sensing, metrology, and quantum information processing. However, it remains a challenging task to efficiently trap a large ensemble of cold atoms on an integrated nanophotonic circuit. Here, we demonstrate direct loading of an ensemble of up to 70 atoms into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit. Efficient trap loading is achieved by employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling in the microtrap, where a built-in spin-motion coupling arises directly from the vector light shift of the evanescent field potential on a microring. Atoms are cooled into the trap via optical pumping with a single free space beam. We have achieved a trap lifetime approaching 700ms under continuous cooling. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mapping of three states and its implementation on a cloud quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping three pure qubit states, implement it by the dilation method, and demonstrate it with a superconducting quantum processor provided by the IBM Quantum Experience. We derive exact formulas for the population of the post-selected $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace and show consistency with the Hermitian case, conservation of average projections on reference vectors, and Quantum Fisher Information. When used for discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm gives an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach provides novel properties unavailable in the conventional Hermitian case and can transform an arbitrary set of three quantum states into another arbitrary set of three states at the cost of introducing an inconclusive result. For the QKD three-state protocol, our algorithm has the same error rate as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. The proposed method surpasses its Hermitian counterparts in quantum sensing using non-MSE metrics, providing an advantage for precise estimations within specific data space regions and improved robustness to outliers. Applied to quantum database search, our approach yields a notable decrease in circuit depth in comparison to traditional Grover's search algorithm while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls, thereby offering significant advantages for NISQ computers. Additionally, the versatility of our method can be valuable for the discrimination of highly non-symmetric quantum states, and quantum error correction.

      <title>Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Gates with on-Demand Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are an essential prerequisite for large-scale quantum computation. When manipulating practical quantum systems, environmentally and operationally induced errors are inevitable, and thus, in addition to being fast, it is preferable that operations should be intrinsically robust against different errors. Here, we propose a general protocol for constructing geometric quantum gates with on-demand trajectories by modulating the applied pulse shapes that define the system's evolution trajectory. Our scheme adopts reverse engineering of the target Hamiltonian using smooth pulses, which also eliminates the difficulty of calculating geometric phases for an arbitrary trajectory. Furthermore, because a particular geometric gate can be induced by various different trajectories, we can further optimize the gate performance under different scenarios; the results of numerical simulations indicate that this optimization can greatly enhance the quality of the gate. In addition, we present an implementation of our proposal using superconducting circuits, showcasing substantial enhancements in gate performance compared with conventional schemes. Our protocol thus presents a promising approach for high-fidelity and strong-robust geometric quantum gates for large-scale quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Weak coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two mutually distrustful parties generate a shared random bit to agree on a winner via remote communication. While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol can be constructed from noiseless communication channels, its composability has not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping protocol can be abstracted into a black box resource with composable security. Despite this, we also establish the overall stand-alone security of weak coin flipping protocols under sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Representation of Gaussian Fermionic Pure States in Non-Computational Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for representing Gaussian fermionic states, pivotal in quantum spin systems and fermionic models, within a range of alternative quantum bases. We focus on transitioning these states from the conventional computational (\sigma^z) basis to more complex bases, such as ((\phi, \frac{\pi}{2}, \alpha)), which are essential for accurately calculating critical quantities like formation probabilities and Shannon entropy. We present a novel algorithm that not only simplifies the basis transformation but also reduces computational complexity, making it feasible to calculate amplitudes of large systems efficiently. Our key contribution is a technique that translates amplitude calculations into the Pfaffian computation of submatrices from an antisymmetric matrix, a process facilitated by understanding domain wall relationships across different bases. As an application, we will determine the formation probabilities for various bases and configurations within the critical transverse field Ising chain, considering both periodic and open boundary conditions. We aim to categorize the configurations and bases by examining the universal constant term that characterizes the scaling of the logarithm of the formation probability in the periodic system, as well as the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the case of open systems. In the open system scenario, this coefficient is influenced by the central charge and the conformal weight of the boundary condition-changing operator. This work is set to expand the toolkit available for researchers in quantum information theory and many-body physics, providing a more efficient and elegant solution for exploring Gaussian fermionic states in non-standard quantum bases.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear mean field dynamics enables quantum information processing operations that are impossible in linear one-particle quantum mechanics. In this approach, a register of bosonic qubits (such as neutral atoms or polaritons) is initialized into a symmetric product state through condensation, then subsequently controlled by varying the qubit-qubit interaction. We propose an experimental implementation of quantum state discrimination, an important subroutine in quantum computation, with a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate. The condensed bosons here are atoms, each in the same superposition of angular momenta 0 and 1, encoding a qubit. A nice feature of the protocol is that only readout of individual quantized circulation states (not superpositions) is required.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>

      <title>The computational power of random quantum circuits in arbitrary geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of $\sim 50$ qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and therefore how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly-entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer enabling it to operate on up to $56$ qubits with arbitrary connectivity and $99.843(5)\%$ two-qubit gate fidelity. Utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2, we present data from random circuit sampling in highly connected geometries, doing so at unprecedented fidelities and a scale that appears to be beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical algorithms. The considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the QCCD architecture as continued progress is made towards building larger machines.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the analysis of amplitude transfer in Quantum Variational Algorithms (QVAs) for combinatorial optimisation with mixing unitaries defined by vertex-transitive graphs, based on their continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) representation and the theory of graph automorphism groups. This framework leads to a heuristic for designing efficient problem-specific QVAs. Using this heuristic, we develop novel algorithms for unconstrained and constrained optimisation. We outline their implementation with polynomial gate complexity and simulate their application to the parallel machine scheduling and portfolio rebalancing combinatorial optimisation problems, showing significantly improved convergence over preexisting QVAs. Based on our analysis, we derive metrics for evaluating the suitability of graph structures for specific problem instances, and for establishing bounds on the convergence supported by different graph structures. For mixing unitaries characterised by a CTQW over a Hamming graph on $m$-tuples of length $n$, our results indicate that the amplification upper bound increases with problem size like $\mathcal{O}(e^{n \log m})$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative dynamics of flat-band systems with correlated disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the time evolution of Gaussian wave packets on flat-band lattices in the presence of correlated disorder. To achieve this, we introduce a method to generate random on-site energies with prescribed correlations. We verify this method with a one-dimensional (1D) cross-stitch model, and find good agreement with analytical results obtained from the disorder-dressed evolution equations. This allows us to reproduce previous findings, that disorder can mobilize 1D flat-band states which would otherwise remain localized. As explained by the corresponding disorder-dressed evolution equations, such mobilization requires an asymmetric disorder-induced coupling to dispersive bands, a condition that is generically not fulfilled when the flat-band is resonant with the dispersive bands at a Dirac point-like crossing. We exemplify this with the 1D Lieb lattice. While analytical expressions are not available for the two-dimensional (2D) system due to its complexity, we extend the numerical method to the 2D $\alpha-T_3$ model, and find that the initial flat-band wave packet preserves its localization when $\alpha = 0$, regardless of disorder and intersections. However, when $\alpha\neq 0$, the wave packet shifts in real space. We interpret this as a Berry phase controlled, disorder-induced wave-packet mobilization. In addition, we present density functional theory calculations of candidate materials, specifically $\rm Hg_{1-x}Cd_xTe$. The flat-band emerges near the $\Gamma$ point ($\bf{k}=$0) in the Brillouin zone.</description>

Abstract: Diamond has superlative material properties for a broad range of quantum and electronic technologies. However, heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal diamond remains limited, impeding integration and evolution of diamond-based technologies. Here, we directly bond single-crystal diamond membranes to a wide variety of materials including silicon, fused silica, sapphire, thermal oxide, and lithium niobate. Our bonding process combines customized membrane synthesis, transfer, and dry surface functionalization, allowing for minimal contamination while providing pathways for near unity yield and scalability. We generate bonded crystalline membranes with thickness as low as 10 nm, sub-nm interfacial regions, and nanometer-scale thickness variability over 200 by 200 $\mu m^2$ areas. We measure spin coherence times $T_2$ for nitrogen-vacancy centers in bonded membranes of up to 623(21) $\mu$s, suitable for advanced quantum applications. We demonstrate multiple methods for integrating high quality factor nanophotonic cavities with the diamond heterostructures, highlighting the platform versatility in quantum photonic applications. Furthermore, we show that our ultra-thin diamond membranes are compatible with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which enables interfacing coherent diamond quantum sensors with living cells while rejecting unwanted background luminescence. The processes demonstrated herein provide a full toolkit to synthesize heterogeneous diamond-based hybrid systems for quantum and electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Programmable order by disorder effect and underlying phases through dipolar quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study two different quantum simulators composed of molecules with dipole-dipole interaction through various theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms in the triangular optical lattice with a controllable diagonal anisotropy. When the numbers of up spins and down spins are equal, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Adopting the the real space perturbation theory, our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state~(iPEPS) and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting. The iPEPS results show that even when the spin exchange coupling is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposal indicates realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases. We believe that our results indicated here can also become a good benchmark for the two-dimensional quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of energy transport in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state, we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble. Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed, our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope, for example, to even lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Bogoliubov momentum pairing and emergence of non-Gaussian correlations in ultracold interacting Bose gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum matter -- such as interacting electron systems or interacting quantum fluids -- possesses properties that cannot be understood in terms of linear fluctuations and free quasi-particles. Quantum fluctuations in these systems are indeed large and generically exhibit non-Gaussian statistics -- a property captured only by inspecting high-order correlations, whose quantitative reconstruction poses a formidable challenge to both experiments and theory alike. A prime example of correlated quantum matter is the strongly interacting Bose fluid, realized by superfluid Helium and, more recently, ultra-cold atoms. Here, we experimentally study interacting Bose gases from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime through single-atom-resolved correlations in momentum space. We observe that the Bogoliubov pairing among modes of opposite momenta, emblematic of the weakly interacting regime, is suppressed as interactions become stronger. This departure from the predictions of Bogoliubov theory signals the onset of the strongly correlated regime, as confirmed by numerical simulations that highlight the role of non-linear quantum fluctuations in our system. Additionally, our measurements unveil a non-zero four-operator cumulant at even stronger interactions, which is a direct signature of non-Gaussian correlations. These results shed light on the emergence and physical origin of non-Gaussian correlations in ensembles of interacting bosons.</description>

Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>
