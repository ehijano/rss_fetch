      <title>GlucoBench: Curated List of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Datasets with Prediction Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising rates of diabetes necessitate innovative methods for its management. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are small medical devices that measure blood glucose levels at regular intervals providing insights into daily patterns of glucose variation. Forecasting of glucose trajectories based on CGM data holds the potential to substantially improve diabetes management, by both refining artificial pancreas systems and enabling individuals to make adjustments based on predictions to maintain optimal glycemic range.Despite numerous methods proposed for CGM-based glucose trajectory prediction, these methods are typically evaluated on small, private datasets, impeding reproducibility, further research, and practical adoption. The absence of standardized prediction tasks and systematic comparisons between methods has led to uncoordinated research efforts, obstructing the identification of optimal tools for tackling specific challenges. As a result, only a limited number of prediction methods have been implemented in clinical practice.
  To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive resource that provides (1) a consolidated repository of curated publicly available CGM datasets to foster reproducibility and accessibility; (2) a standardized task list to unify research objectives and facilitate coordinated efforts; (3) a set of benchmark models with established baseline performance, enabling the research community to objectively gauge new methods' efficacy; and (4) a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors for model development. We anticipate these resources to propel collaborative research endeavors in the critical domain of CGM-based glucose predictions. {Our code is available online at github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sex differences in brain network topology by aggregating nodal centrality rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although numerous studies report significant sex differences in functional connectivity, these differences do not sufficient to reveal specific functional disparities among brain regions or the topological differences in brain networks. Meanwhile, individual differences could potentially bias the understanding of these sex differences. To address these challenges, we propose a consensus rank-based method to quantify sex differences in four node centrality ranking within the functional brain network. This method aggregates individuals' nodal centrality rankings into a consensus or "average" ranking, minimizing the impact of outliers and enhancing the robustness of the findings. By analyzing resting-state functional MRI data from 1,948 healthy young adults (aged 18-27 years, 1,163 females), we find significant sex differences in the topology of functional brain network, primarily attributed to biological sex rather than individual differences. Particularly, sex accounts for approximately 10% of the differences in nodal centrality consensus rankings. Using a rank difference index (RDI), we identify eight critical brain regions with the greatest rank differences, including the insula, supramarginal gyrus, and dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. females show higher rankings in regions with stronger intra-system connections, whereas males dominate in areas with stronger inter-system connections. Our findings enhance our understanding of sex-specific characteristics in functional brain networks. Moreover, our approach may offer novel insights into targeted population studies, including those involving healthy individuals and patients with brain injuries.</description>

      <title>i-GRIP, a Grasping Movement Intention Estimator for Intuitive Control of Assistive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study describes and evaluates i-GRIP, a novel movement intention estimator designed to facilitate the control of assistive devices for grasping tasks in individuals with upper limb impairments. Operating within a collaborative grasping control paradigm, the users naturally move their hand towards an object they wish to grasp and i-GRIP identifies the target of the movement and selects an appropriate grip for the assistive device to perform. In an experimental study involving 11 healthy participants, i-GRIP exhibited promising estimation performances and responsiveness. The proposed approach paves the way towards more intuitive control of grasping assistive device for individuals with upper limb impairments.</description>

      <title>Observability rank conditions for analysing practical identifiability a priori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of identifiability describes the possibility of inferring the parameters of a dynamic model by observing its output. It is common and useful to distinguish between structural and practical identifiability. The former property is fully determined by the model equations, while the latter is also influenced by the characteristics of the available experimental data. Structural identifiability can be determined by means of symbolic computations, which may be performed before collecting experimental data, and are hence sometimes called a priori analyses. Practical identifiability is typically assessed numerically, with methods that require simulations - and often also optimization - and are applied a posteriori. An approach to study structural local identifiability is to consider it as a particular case of observability, which is the possibility of inferring the internal state of a system from its output. Thus, both properties can be analysed jointly, by building a generalized observability matrix and computing its rank. The aim of this paper is to investigate to which extent such observability-based methods can also inform about practical identifiability. To this end, we explore a number of possible extensions of the rank tests, and discuss the purposes for which they can be informative as well as others for which they cannot.</description>

      <title>CaLMFlow: Volterra Flow Matching using Causal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CaLMFlow (Causal Language Models for Flow Matching), a novel framework that casts flow matching as a Volterra integral equation (VIE), leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) for continuous data generation. CaLMFlow enables the direct application of LLMs to learn complex flows by formulating flow matching as a sequence modeling task, bridging discrete language modeling and continuous generative modeling. Our method implements tokenization across space and time, thereby solving a VIE over these domains. This approach enables efficient handling of high-dimensional data and outperforms ODE solver-dependent methods like conditional flow matching (CFM). We demonstrate CaLMFlow's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world data, including single-cell perturbation response prediction, showcasing its ability to incorporate textual context and generalize to unseen conditions. Our results highlight LLM-driven flow matching as a promising paradigm in generative modeling, offering improved scalability, flexibility, and context-awareness.</description>

      <title>Optimized Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Using Ziv-Zakai Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) has emerged as a promising quantitative imaging technique within the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), offers comprehensive insights into tissue properties by simultaneously acquiring multiple tissue parameter maps in a single acquisition. Sequence optimization is crucial for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRF. In this work, a novel framework for MRF sequence optimization is proposed based on the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB). Unlike the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), which aims to enhance the quality of a single fingerprint signal with deterministic parameters, ZZB provides insights into evaluating the minimum mismatch probability for pairs of fingerprint signals within the specified parameter range in MRF. Specifically, the explicit ZZB is derived to establish a lower bound for the discrimination error in the fingerprint signal matching process within MRF. This bound illuminates the intrinsic limitations of MRF sequences, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of existing sequence performance. Subsequently, an optimal experiment design problem based on ZZB was formulated to ascertain the optimal scheme of acquisition parameters, maximizing discrimination power of MRF between different tissue types. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the optimized ZZB scheme outperforms both the conventional and CRB schemes in terms of the reconstruction accuracy of multiple parameter maps.</description>

      <title>Extraction of geometric and transport parameters from the time constant of exocytosis transients measured by nanoscale electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exocytosis is a fundamental process related to the information exchange in the nervous and endocrine system. Among the various techniques, vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) has emerged as an effective method to mimic the exocytosis process and measure dynamic information about content transfer using nanoscale electrodes. In this manuscript, through analytical models and large scale simulations, we develop scaling laws for the decay time constant ($\tau$) for VIEC single-exponential transients. Specifically, our results anticipate a power law dependence of $\tau$ on the geometric and the transport parameters. This model compares very well with large scale simulations exploring the parameter space relevant for VIEC and with experimental results from literature. Remarkably, such physics based compact models could allow for novel multi-feature based self consistent strategies for back extraction of geometric and transport parameters and hence could contribute towards better statistical analysis and understanding of exocytosis transients and events.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing End Stage Renal Disease Outcome Prediction: A Multi-Sourced Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.</description>

      <title>LISBET: a machine learning model for the automatic segmentation of social behavior motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social behavior is crucial for survival in many animal species, and a heavily investigated research subject. Current analysis methods generally rely on measuring animal interaction time or annotating predefined behaviors. However, these approaches are time consuming, human biased, and can fail to capture subtle behaviors. Here we introduce LISBET (LISBET Is a Social BEhavior Transformer), a machine learning model for detecting and segmenting social interactions. Using self-supervised learning on body tracking data, our model eliminates the need for extensive human annotation. We tested LISBET in three scenarios across multiple datasets in mice: supervised behavior classification, unsupervised motifs segmentation, and unsupervised animal phenotyping. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology revealed distinct neural signatures in the Ventral Tegmental Area corresponding to motifs identified by our model. In summary, LISBET automates data annotation and reduces human bias in social behavior research, offering a promising approach to enhance our understanding of behavior and its neural correlates.</description>

      <title>Improving Molecule Generation and Drug Discovery with a Knowledge-enhanced Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have established state-of-the-art benchmarks in the generation of molecules and novel drug candidates. Despite these successes, a significant gap persists between generative models and the utilization of extensive biomedical knowledge, often systematized within knowledge graphs, whose potential to inform and enhance generative processes has not been realized. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges this divide by developing a framework for knowledge-enhanced generative models called KARL. We develop a scalable methodology to extend the functionality of knowledge graphs while preserving semantic integrity, and incorporate this contextual information into a generative framework to guide a diffusion-based model. The integration of knowledge graph embeddings with our generative model furnishes a robust mechanism for producing novel drug candidates possessing specific characteristics while ensuring validity and synthesizability. KARL outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on both unconditional and targeted generation tasks.</description>
