      <title>Laser-triggered THz emission from near critical density targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulse propagation in a relativistic self-trapping regime (RST) in a near-critical density plasma makes it possible to maximize the total charge of the accelerating electrons and laser-to-electrons conversion rate, that can be used to provide a large amount of the THz range coherent transition radiation. The three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate how such transition radiation generates when electrons escape into vacuum either from the low-density target itself, or after passing through a thin foil located at the target end. Advantage of the RST regime for generation of THz pulses is clearly demonstrated as compared to laser irradiation of such a standard target as a foil with preplasma on its front side. Simulation performed has shown that for the optimized laser-target matching a 2-J femtosecond laser pulse is able to produce quasi-unipolar Thz pulses with energy exceeding 100 mJ.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of neutron energy isotropy in a sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.</description>

      <title>Short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l)$ of the uniform electron gas based on direct \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results over an unprecedented range of wavenumbers, $q\lesssim20q_\textnormal{F}$, where $q_\textnormal{F}$ is the Fermi wavenumber. We find excellent agreement with the analytically derived asymptotic limit by Hou \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~B}~\textbf{106}, L081126 (2022)] for the static local field correction and empirically confirm the independence of the short wavelength limit with respect to the Matsubara frequency $z_l$. In the warm dense matter regime, we find that the onset of the quantum tail in the static local field correction closely coincides with the onset of the algebraic tail in the momentum distribution function and the corresponding empirical criterion reported by Hunger \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~E} \textbf{103}, 053204 (2021)]. In the strongly coupled electron liquid regime, our calculations reveal a more complicated non-monotonic convergence towards the $q\to\infty$ limit that is shaped by the spatial structure in the system. We expect our results to be of broad interest for a number of fields including the study of matter under extreme conditions, the development of improved dielectric theories, and the construction of advanced exchange--correlation functionals for thermal density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Electron Influence on the Parallel Proton Firehose Instability in 10-Moment, Multi-Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy play a critical role in modulating the energy transfer in space and astrophysical plasmas. For the first time, we simulate the evolution and saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability using a multi-fluid model without adding artificial viscosity. These simulations are performed using a 10-moment, multi-fluid model with local and gradient relaxation heat-flux closures in high-$\beta$ proton-electron plasmas. When these higher-order moments are included and pressure anisotropy is permitted to develop in all species, we find that the electrons have a significant impact on the saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability, modulating the proton pressure anisotropy as the instability saturates. Even for lower $\beta$s more relevant to heliospheric plasmas, we observe a pronounced electron energization in simulations using the gradient relaxation closure. Our results indicate that resolving the electron pressure anisotropy is important to correctly describe the behavior of multi-species plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Mosaic Crystal Instrument Functions on X-ray Thomson Scattering Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mosaic crystals, with their high integrated reflectivities, are widely-employed in spectrometers used to diagnose high energy density systems. X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool of these systems, providing in principle direct access to important properties such as the temperature via detailed balance. However, the measured XRTS spectrum is broadened by the spectrometer instrument function (IF), and without careful consideration of the IF one risks misdiagnosing system conditions. Here, we consider in detail the IF of 40 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m mosaic HAPG crystals, and how the broadening varies across the spectrometer in an energy range of 6.7-8.6 keV. Notably, we find a strong asymmetry in the shape of the IF towards higher energies. As an example, we consider the effect of the asymmetry in the IF on the temperature inferred via XRTS for simulated 80 eV CH plasmas, and find that the temperature can be overestimated if an approximate symmetric IF is used. We therefore expect a detailed consideration of the full IF will have an important impact on system properties inferred via XRTS in both forward modelling and model-free approaches.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-driven filamentation of warm beams in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged and quasi-neutral beams propagating through an unmagnetised plasma are subject to numerous collisionless instabilities on the small scale of the plasma skin depth. The electrostatic two-stream instability, driven by longitudinal and transverse wakefields, dominates for dilute beams. This leads to modulation of the beam along the propagation direction and, for wide beams, transverse filamentation. A three-dimensional spatiotemporal two-stream theory for warm beams with a finite extent is developed. Unlike the cold beam limit, diffusion due to a finite emittance gives rise to a dominant wavenumber, and a cut-off wavenumber above which filamentation is suppressed. Particle-in-cell simulations with quasineutral electron-positron beams in the relativistic regime give excellent agreement with the theoretical model. This work provides deeper insights into the effect of diffusion on filamentation of finite beams, crucial for comprehending plasma-based accelerators in laboratory and cosmic settings.</description>
