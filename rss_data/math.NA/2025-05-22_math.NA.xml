      <title>Fast Newton Transform: Interpolation in Downward Closed Polynomial Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Fast Newton Transform (FNT), an algorithm for performing $m$-variate Newton interpolation in downward closed polynomial spaces with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(|A|m\overline{n})$. Here, $A$ is a downward closed set of cardinality $|A|$ equal to the dimension of the associated downward closed polynomial space $\Pi_A$, where $\overline{n}$ denotes the mean of the maximum polynomial degrees across the spatial dimensions. For functions being analytic in an open Bernstein poly-ellipse, geometric approximation rates apply when interpolating in non-tensorial Leja-ordered Chebyshev-Lobatto grids or Leja nodes. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we utilize $\ell^p$-sets, with the Euclidean case $(p=2)$ turning out to be the pivotal choice, leading to $|A|/(n+1)^m \in \mathcal{O}(e^{-m})$. Expanding non-periodic functions, the FNT complements the approximation capabilities of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Choosing $\ell^2$-sets for $A$ renders the FNT time complexity to be less than the FFT time complexity $\mathcal{O}((n+1)^m m \log(n))$ in a range of $n$, behaving as $\mathcal{O}(m e^m)$. Maintaining this advantage true for the differentials, the FNT sets a new standard in $m$-variate interpolation and approximation practice.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Methods and Stiff Order Conditions for Semilinear ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical convergence theory of Runge-Kutta methods assumes that the time step is small relative to the Lipschitz constant of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). For stiff problems, that assumption is often violated, and a problematic degradation in accuracy, known as order reduction, can arise. High stage order methods can avoid order reduction, but they must be fully implicit. For linear problems, weaker stiff order conditions exist and are compatible with computationally efficient methods, i.e., explicit or diagonally implicit. This work develops a new theory of stiff order conditions and convergence for semilinear ODEs, consisting of a stiff linear term and a non-stiff nonlinear term. New semilinear order conditions are formulated in terms of orthogonality relations enumerated by rooted trees. Novel, optimized diagonally implicit methods are constructed that satisfy these semilinear conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that for a broad class of relevant nonlinear test problems, these new methods successfully mitigate order reduction and yield highly accurate numerical approximations.</description>

      <title>A coupled HDG discretization for the interaction between acoustic and elastic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an HDG scheme for the Laplace-domain interaction between a transient acoustic wave and a bounded elastic solid embedded in an unbounded fluid medium. Two mixed variables (the stress tensor and the velocity of the acoustic wave) are included while the symmetry of the stress tensor is imposed weakly by considering the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor (the spin or vorticity tensor) as an additional unknown. The optimal convergence of the method is demonstrated theoretically and numerical results confirming the theoretical prediction are presented.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Methods for Finite-Strain Elasticity: Automatic Code Generation with No Performance Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores matrix-free tangent evaluations in finite-strain elasticity with the use of automatically-generated code for the quadrature-point level calculations. The code generation is done via automatic differentiation (AD) with AceGen. We compare hand-written and AD-generated codes under two computing strategies: on-the-fly evaluation and caching intermediate results. The comparison reveals that the AD-generated code achieves superior performance in matrix-free computations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based parameter optimization for M\"untz spectral methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral methods employing non-standard polynomial bases, such as M\"untz polynomials, have proven effective for accurately solving problems with solutions exhibiting low regularity, notably including sub-diffusion equations. However, due to the absence of theoretical guidance, the key parameters controlling the exponents of M\"untz polynomials are usually determined empirically through extensive numerical experiments, leading to a time-consuming tuning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based optimization framework for the M\"untz spectral method. As an illustrative example, we optimize the parameter selection for solving time-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict optimal parameter values based solely on the time-fractional order as input. The ANN is trained by minimizing solution errors on a one-dimensional time-fractional convection-diffusion equation featuring manufactured exact solutions that manifest singularities of varying intensity, covering a comprehensive range of sampled fractional orders. Numerical results for time-fractional PDEs in both one and two dimensions demonstrate that the ANN-based parameter prediction significantly improves the accuracy of the M\"untz spectral method. Moreover, the trained ANN generalizes effectively from one-dimensional to two-dimensional cases, highlighting its robustness across spatial dimensions. Additionally, we verify that the ANN substantially outperforms traditional function approximators, such as spline interpolation, in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency. The proposed optimization framework can be extended beyond fractional PDEs, offering a versatile and powerful approach for spectral methods applied to various low-regularity problems.</description>

      <title>Improved power methods for computing eigenvalues of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the eigenvalue computation problem of the dual quaternion Hermitian matrix closely related to multi-agent group control. Recently, power method was proposed by Cui and Qi in Journal of Scientific Computing, 100 (2024) to solve such problem. Recognizing that the convergence rate of power method is slow due to its dependence on the eigenvalue distribution, we propose two improved versions of power method based on dual complex adjoint matrices and Aitken extrapolation, named DCAM-PM and ADCAM-PM. They achieve notable efficiency improvements and demonstrate significantly faster convergence. However, power method may be invalid for dual quaternion Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues having identical standard parts but distinct dual parts. To overcome this disadvantage, utilizing the eigen-decomposition properties of dual complex adjoint matrix, we propose a novel algorithm EDDCAM-EA which surpasses the power method in both accuracy and speed. Application to eigenvalue computations of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in multi-agent formation control and numerical experiments highlight the remarkable accuracy and speed of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Elasto-acoustic wave propagation in geophysical media using hybrid high-order methods on general meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid high-order (HHO) methods are numerical methods characterized by several interesting properties such as local conservativity, geometric flexibility and high-order accuracy. Here, HHO schemes are studied for the space semi-discretization of coupled elasto-acoustic waves in the time domain using a first-order formulation. Explicit and singly diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta (ERK &amp; SDIRK) schemes are used for the time discretization. We show that an efficient implementation of explicit (resp. implicit) time schemes calls for a static condensation of the face (resp. cell) unknowns. Crucially, both static condensation procedures only involve block-diagonal matrices. Then, we provide numerical estimates for the CFL stability limit of ERK schemes and present a comparative study on the efficiency of explicit versus implicit schemes. Our findings indicate that implicit time schemes remain competitive in many situations. Finally, simulations in a 2D realistic geophysical configuration are performed, illustrating the geometrical flexibility of the HHO method: both hybrid (triangular and quadrangular) and nonconforming (with hanging nodes) meshes are easily handled, delivering results of comparable accuracy to a reference spectral element software based on tensorized elements.</description>

      <title>Geodesic distance approximation using a surface finite element method for the $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the $p$-Laplacian with large $p$-values in order to approximate geodesic distances to features on surfaces. This differs from Fayolle and Belyaev's (2018) [1] computational results using the $p$-Laplacian for the distance-to-surface problem. Our approach appears to offer some distinct advantages over other popular PDE-based distance function approximation methods. We employ a surface finite element scheme and demonstrate numerical convergence to the true geodesic distance functions. We check that our numerical results adhere to the triangle inequality and examine robustness against geometric noise such as vertex perturbations. We also present comparisons of our method with the heat method from Crane et al. [2] and the classical polyhedral method from Mitchell et al. [3].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies a general divide-and-conquer algorithm for approximating continuous one-dimensional probability distributions with finite mean. The article presents a numerical study that compares pre-existing approximation schemes with a special focus on the stability of the discrete approximations when they undergo arithmetic operations. The main results are a simple upper bound of the approximation error in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance that is valid for all continuous distributions with finite mean. In many use-cases, the studied method achieve optimal rate of convergence, and numerical experiments show that the algorithm is more stable than pre-existing approximation schemes in the context of arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Differentiable Approximation of Generalized Low-rank Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps. In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks, which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/naiqili/EDLRR.</description>

      <title>Damping optimization of discrete mechanical systems -- rod/string model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates two optimization criteria for damping optimization in a multi-body oscillator system with arbitrary degrees of freedom ($n$), resembling string/rod free vibrations. The total average energy over all possible initial data and the total average displacement over all possible initial data. Our first result shows that both criteria are equivalent to the trace minimization of the solution of the Lyapunov equation with different right-hand sides. As the second result, we prove that in the case of damping with one damper, for the discrete system, the minimal trace for each criterion can be expressed as a linear or cubic function of the dimension $n$. Consequently, the optimal damping position is determined solely by the number of dominant eigenfrequencies and the optimal viscosity, independent of the dimension $n$, offering efficient damping optimization in discrete systems. The paper concludes with numerical examples illustrating the presented theoretical framework and results.</description>

      <title>Deep greedy unfolding: Sorting out argsorting in greedy sparse recovery algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.</description>

Abstract: The aromatic bicomplex is an algebraic tool based on aromatic Butcher trees and used in particular for the explicit description of volume-preserving affine-equivariant numerical integrators. The present work defines new tools inspired from variational calculus such as the Lie derivative, different concepts of symmetries, and Noether's theory in the context of aromatic forests. The approach allows to draw a correspondence between aromatic volume-preserving methods and symmetries on the Euler-Lagrange complex, to write Noether's theorem in the aromatic context, and to describe the aromatic B-series of volume-preserving methods explicitly with the Lie derivative.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Pseudo-inverse Solutions With MINRES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated minimum residual method (MINRES), proposed in the seminal paper of Paige and Saunders, has seen great success and widespread use in solving Hermitian (and complex-symmetric) linear systems. Unless the system is consistent, MINRES is not guaranteed to obtain the pseudo-inverse solution. We propose a novel and remarkably simple minimum-norm refinement (MN refinement) that seamlessly integrates with the final MINRES iteration, enabling us to obtain the minimum-norm solution with negligible additional computational cost. We extend our MN refinement to complex-symmetric systems, building on S.-C. Choi's extension of MINRES for solving these systems. Given the flexibility of MINRES to accommodate singular preconditioners, we further investigate the MN refinement in preconditioned settings that involve singular preconditioners. We also provide numerical experiments to support our analysis and showcase the effects of our MN refinement.</description>

Abstract: This paper treats the inverse problem of retrieving the electrical conductivity starting from boundary measurements in the framework of Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). In particular, the focus is on non-iterative reconstruction methods that are compatible with real-time applications. In this work, the Kernel Method, a new non-iterative reconstruction method for Electrical Resistance Tomography, is presented. The imaging algorithm deals with the problem of retrieving one or more anomalies of arbitrary shape, topology, and size, embedded in a known background (inverse obstacles problem). The foundation of the Kernel Method is that if there exists a proper current density applied at the boundary (Neumann data) of the domain that is able to produce the same measurements with and without the anomaly, then this boundary source produces a power density that vanishes in the region occupied by the anomaly, when applied to the problem involving the background material only. Therefore, the Kernel Method consists of (i) evaluating a proper current density g at the boundary of the domain of interest, by solving a proper linear eigenvalue problem, (ii) solving one direct problem for the configuration without anomaly and driven by g, and (iii) reconstructing the anomaly as the region in which the power density is negligible. This new tomographic method has a very simple numerical implementation that requires a very low computational cost. In addition to theoretical results, an extensive numerical campaign proves the effectiveness of this new imaging method.</description>

      <title>Functional SDE approximation inspired by a deep operator network architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach to approximate solutions of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) by Deep Neural Networks is derived and analysed. The architecture is inspired by the notion of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which is based on operator learning in function spaces in terms of a reduced basis also represented in the network. In our setting, we make use of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) of stochastic processes and call the corresponding architecture SDEONet. The PCE has been used extensively in the area of uncertainty quantification (UQ) with parametric partial differential equations. This however is not the case with SDE, where classical sampling methods dominate and functional approaches are seen rarely. A main challenge with truncated PCEs occurs due to the drastic growth of the number of components with respect to the maximum polynomial degree and the number of basis elements. The proposed SDEONet architecture aims to alleviate the issue of exponential complexity by learning an optimal sparse truncation of the Wiener chaos expansion. A complete convergence and complexity analysis is presented, making use of recent Neural Network approximation results. Numerical experiments illustrate the promising performance of the suggested approach in 1D and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uniform H-matrix Compression with Applications to Boundary Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary integral equations lead to dense system matrices when discretized, yet they are data-sparse. Using the $\mathcal{H}$-matrix format, this sparsity is exploited to achieve $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ complexity for storage and multiplication by a vector. This is achieved purely algebraically, based on low-rank approximations of subblocks, and hence the format is also applicable to a wider range of problems. The $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix format improves the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ by introducing a recursive structure onto subblocks on multiple levels. However, in many cases this comes with a large proportionality constant, making the $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix format advantageous mostly for large problems. In this paper we investigate the usefulness of a matrix format that lies in between these two: Uniform $\mathcal{H}$-matrices. An algebraic compression algorithm is introduced to transform a regular $\mathcal{H}$-matrix into a uniform $\mathcal{H}$-matrix, which maintains the asymptotic complexity. Using examples of the BEM formulation of the Helmholtz equation, we show that this scheme lowers the storage requirement and execution time of the matrix-vector product without significantly impacting the construction time.</description>

      <title>MgFNO: Multi-grid Architecture Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). This paper proposes a multigrid Fourier neural operator (MgFNO) that accelerates the training of traditional Fourier neural operators through a novel three-level hierarchical architecture. The key innovation of MgFNO lies in its decoupled training strategy employing three distinct networks at different resolution levels: a coarse-level network first learns low-resolution approximations, an intermediate network refines the solution, and a fine-level network achieves high-resolution accuracy. By combining the frequency principle of deep neural networks with multigrid methodology, MgFNO effectively bridges the complementary learning patterns of neural networks (low-to-high frequency) and multigrid methods (high-to-low frequency error reduction).Experimental results demonstrate that MgFNO achieves relative errors of 0.17%, 0.28%, and 0.22% on the Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equations, respectively, representing reductions of 89%, 71%, and 83% compared to the conventional FNO. Furthermore, MgFNO supports zero-shot super-resolution prediction, enabling direct application to high-resolution scenarios after training on coarse grids. This study establishes an efficient and high-accuracy new paradigm for solving complex PDEs dominated by high-frequency dynamics. Code and data used are available on https://github.com/guozihao-hub/MgFNO/tree/master.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes fast randomized algorithms for computing the Kronecker Tensor Decomposition (KTD). The proposed algorithms can decompose a given tensor into the KTD format much faster than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Our principal idea is to use the randomization framework to reduce computational complexity significantly. We provide extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed randomized algorithms with several orders of magnitude acceleration compared to the deterministic one. Our simulations use synthetics and real-world datasets with applications to tensor completion, video/image compression, image denoising, and image super-resolution</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Low Tubal Rank Tensor Approximation with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose efficient randomized fixed-precision techniques for low tubal rank approximation of tensors. The proposed methods are faster and more efficient than the existing fixed-precision algorithms for approximating the truncated tensor SVD (T-SVD). Besides, there are a few works on randomized single-pass algorithms for computing low tubal rank approximation of tensors, none of them experimentally reports the robustness of such algorithms for low-rank approximation of real-world data tensors e.g., images and videos. The current single-pass algorithms for tensors are generalizations of those developed for matrices to tensors. However, the single-pass randomized algorithms for matrices have been recently improved and stabilized. Motivated by this progress, in this paper, we also generalize them to the tensor case based on the tubal product (T-product). We conduct extensive simulations to study the robustness of them compared with the existing single-pass randomized algorithms. In particular, we experimentally found that single-pass algorithms with the sketching parameters of equal sizes usually lead to ill-conditioned tensor least-squares problems and inaccurate results. It is experimentally shown that our proposed single-pass algorithms are robust in this sense. Numerical results demonstrate that under the same conditions (setting the same hyper-parameters), our proposed algorithms provide better performance. Three applications to image compression, super-resolution problem and deep learning are also presented.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a finite element method for the Stokes--Poisson--Boltzmann equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a finite element method for the coupling of Stokes and nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equations. The novelty in the formulation is that the coupling from the electric potential to the drag in the momentum balance is rewritten as a weighted advection term. Using Banach's contraction principle, the Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory, and the Minty--Browder theorem, we show that the governing equations have a unique weak solution. We also show that the discrete problem is well-posed, establish C\'ea estimates, and derive convergence rates. We exemplify the properties of the proposed scheme via some numerical experiments showcasing convergence and applicability in the study of electro-osmotic flows in micro-channels.</description>

      <title>Machine learning on manifolds for inverse scattering: Lipschitz stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing Lipschitz stability estimates is crucial for ensuring the mathematical robustness of neural network (NN) approximations in machine learning (ML)-based parameter estimation, particularly in physics-informed settings. In this work, we derive such estimates for the inverse of a nonlinear map defined on a manifold that captures both unknown parameters and the nonlinear physical processes they influence. Our analysis is based on finite-dimensional, learnable representations of the manifold and provides Lipschitz stability estimates on the manifold-based subspaces, for a class of inverse maps associated with parameter dependent linear compact operators. Such operators model scattered and far-field data that can be used to detect structures such as cracks. We apply our theoretical ML manifold framework to inverse Helmholtz problems in unbounded regions exterior to cracks, addressing the scattered-field data-driven inverse problem while ensuring injectivity conditions on the manifold, a requirement for the Lipschitz stability. Our method accurately recovers crack-defining parameters without requiring prior knowledge of inputs such as incident wave types or external forces on the crack. Numerical experiments using NN approximations confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the coupled and decoupled BDF2 finite element discrete schemes are obtained for the time-dependent bioconvection flows problem with concentration dependent viscosity, which consisting of the Navier-Stokes equation coupled with a linear convection-diffusion equation modeling the concentration of microorganisms in a culture fluid. The unconditionally optimal error estimate for the velocity and concentration in $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm are proved by using finite element approximations in space and finite differences in time.

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction in Lipschitz domains, via probabilistic couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We let $P_N$ its transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$, also known as ground state. Under mild assumptions on $\Omega$, we give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$, namely on its $k$-th order differences, with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. We provide a completely probabilistic proof of these estimates: our starting point is a Feynman--Kac representation of $\phi_N$, combined with gambler's ruin estimates and a new ``multi-mirror'' coupling, which may be of independent interest. We also obtain the same type of estimates for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, in relation with a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. Finally, we take the opportunity to review (and slightly extend) some of the literature on the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be derived thanks to our estimates.</description>

Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit a new pre-Lie algebra in the framework of symplectic groupoids and, in turn, introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spectral optimal control framework for Fokker-Planck equations based on the standard ground state transformation that maps the Fokker-Planck operator to a Schrodinger operator. Our primary objective is to accelerate convergence toward the (unique) steady state. To fulfill this objective, a gradient-based iterative algorithm with Pontryagin's maximum principle and the Barzilai-Borwein update is developed to compute time-dependent controls. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional ill-conditioned normal distributions and double-well potentials demonstrate that our approach effectively targets slow-decaying modes, thus increasing the spectral gap.</description>
