      <title>Large Investment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These "global patterns" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.</description>

      <title>A new measure of risk using Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Fourier analysis to access risk in financial products. With it we analyze price changes of e.g. stocks. Via Fourier analysis we scrutinize quantitatively whether the frequency of change is higher than a change in (conserved) company value would allow. If it is the case, it would be a clear indicator of speculation and with it risk. The entire methods or better its application is fairly new. However, there were severe flaws in previous attempts; making the results (not the method) doubtful. We corrected all these mistakes by e.g. using Fourier transformation instead of discrete Fourier analysis. Our analysis is reliable in the entire frequency band, even for fre-quency of 1/1d or higher if the prices are noted accordingly. For the stocks scrutinized we found that the price of stocks changes disproportionally within one week which clearly indicates spec-ulation. It would be an interesting extension to apply the method to crypto currencies as these currencies have no conserved value which makes normal considerations of volatility difficult.</description>

      <title>Can an unsupervised clustering algorithm reproduce a categorization system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer analysis is a critical component of investment management, often relying on expert-provided categorization systems. These systems' consistency is questioned when they do not align with cohorts from unsupervised clustering algorithms optimized for various metrics. We investigate whether unsupervised clustering can reproduce ground truth classes in a labeled dataset, showing that success depends on feature selection and the chosen distance metric. Using toy datasets and fund categorization as real-world examples we demonstrate that accurately reproducing ground truth classes is challenging. We also highlight the limitations of standard clustering evaluation metrics in identifying the optimal number of clusters relative to the ground truth classes. We then show that if appropriate features are available in the dataset, and a proper distance metric is known (e.g., using a supervised Random Forest-based distance metric learning method), then an unsupervised clustering can indeed reproduce the ground truth classes as distinct clusters.</description>

      <title>Time-Series K-means in Causal Inference and Mechanism Clustering for Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Time Series K-means (TS-K-means) within the context of causal inference and mechanism clustering of financial time series data. Traditional clustering approaches like K-means often rely on static distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, which inadequately capture the temporal dependencies intrinsic to financial returns. By incorporating Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a distance metric, TS-K-means addresses this limitation, improving the robustness of clustering in time-dependent financial data. This study extends the Additive Noise Model Mixture Model (ANM-MM) framework by integrating TS-K-means, facilitating more accurate causal inference and mechanism clustering. The approach is validated through simulations and applied to real-world financial data, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the analysis of complex financial time series, particularly in identifying causal relationships and clustering data based on underlying generative mechanisms. The results show that TS-K-means outperforms traditional K-means, especially with smaller datasets, while maintaining robust causal direction detection as the dataset size changes.</description>
