      <title>Modular analogs of character formulas and multiplicities of induced representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $k$ a characteristic-$p$ field, and $\pi$ be a simple $k[G]$-module. We show that if $\pi$ is in a $p$-nilpotent block with cyclic defect group, then $\pi$ appears with multiplicity at most one in the socle and cosocle of induced $k[G]$-modules that are multiplicity-free in characteristic zero and satisfy some additional hypotheses. We show that this applies, in particular, to certain Deligne--Lusztig modules $\pi$. As an application, we prove that well-known character formulas for cuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$ have modular analogs as statements about short exact sequences of lattices. We also prove modular analogs of character formulas for representations coming from higher-depth supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$. The appendix by the authors and R. Zhang is an erratum to ``Modular Gelfand pairs and multiplicity-free representations'' by R. Zhang, which states some multiplicity-freeness results in overly broad generality; we provide counterexamples and partial corrections to these claims.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow for minimal $W$-algebras and application to unitarity of their representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spectral flow, we provide a proof of [9, Theorem 9.17] on unitarity of Ramond twisted non-extremal representations of minimal $W$-algebras that does not rely on the still conjectural exactness of the twisted quantum reduction functor (see Conjecture 9.11 of [9]). When $\mathfrak g=spo(2|2n)$, $F(4)$, $D(2,1;\frac{m}{n})$, it is also proven that the unitarity of extremal (=massless) representations of the minimal $W$-algebra $W^k_{\min}(\mathfrak g)$ in the Ramond sector is equivalent to the unitarity of extremal representations in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.</description>

      <title>The Auslander-Gorenstein condition for monomial algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Auslander-Gorenstein property for monomial algebras. First, we prove that every Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebra is a string algebra and present a simple combinatorial classification of Auslander-Gorenstein gentle algebras. Furthermore, we describe a procedure to transform any 2-Gorenstein monomial algebra into a Nakayama algebra, thereby reducing the classification of Auslander-Gorenstein monomial algebras to that of Auslander-Gorenstein Nakayama algebras. As an application of this reduction method, we prove that every monomial algebra satisfies a stronger version of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture.
  Our second main result establishes that a monomial algebra is Auslander-Gorenstein if and only if it has a well-defined, bijective Auslander-Reiten map, confirming a conjecture of Marczinzik for monomial algebras. This yields a new homological characterisation of the Auslander-Gorenstein property. Additionally, we provide an explicit description of the Auslander-Reiten bijection in the case of gentle algebras. Along the way, we also generalise a result of Iwanaga and Fuller: We show that every $2n$-Gorenstein monomial algebra is also $(2n+1)$-Gorenstein for every $n\ge 1.$</description>

      <title>Level-Rank Dualities for Finite Reductive Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an extended abstract of our work "Level-Rank Dualities from $\Phi$-Cuspidal Pairs..." We present evidence for a family of surprising coincidences within the representation theory of a finite reductive group $G$: more precisely, dualities between blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras attached by Brou\'e-Malle to $\Phi$-cuspidal pairs of $G$, where the Hecke parameters are specialized not to the order of the underlying finite field, but to roots of unity. For the groups $G = \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F}_q)$, these coincidences can be expressed very concretely in terms of the combinatorics of partitions, and the whole story recovers an avatar of the level-rank duality studied by Frenkel, Uglov, Chuang-Miyachi, and others.</description>

      <title>Representations of conformal nets associated with infinite-dimensional groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between representations of certain infinite-dimensional Lie groups and those of the associated conformal nets. For a chiral conformal net extending the net generated by the vacuum representation of a loop group or diffeomorphism group of the circle, we show that any conformal net representation induces a positive-energy representation of the corresponding group. Consequently, we prove that any representation of such a conformal net is automatically diffeomorphism covariant. Moreover, we show that the covariance cocycles of conformal net representations satisfy naturality with respect to the action of diffeomorphisms, i.e. the diffeomorphisms act equivariantly on the category of conformal net representations.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of an endotrivial complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$. We examine the Lefschetz homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$ from the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, to the orthogonal unit group of the Grothendieck group of $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, i.e. the trivial source ring. When $p = 2$ and $k = \mathbb{F}_2$, $\Lambda$ is surjective when $G$ has a Sylow $2$-subgroup with fusion controlled by its normalizer, and when $G$ has dihedral Sylow $2$-subgroups. When $p$ is odd, $\Lambda$ is surjective if $G$ has a cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroup or is $p$-nilpotent, but we exhibit examples of groups of $p$-rank 2 or greater for which $\Lambda$ is not surjective. We also examine the kernel of the Lefschetz homomorphism, determining it for all groups when $p = 2$ and for groups with cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroups when $p$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Rooted tree modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rooted tree module (RTM) $M:=M(T,F)$ over a zero-relation algebra $\Lambda:=\mathcal KQ/\langle\rho\rangle$ over a field $\mathcal K$ is given by the data of a quiver morphism $F:T\to Q$ from a rooted tree $T$ (either with a source or a sink) taking paths in $T$ to paths in $Q$ not lying in $\langle\rho\rangle$. When $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, we provide a checkable combinatorial characterization of the indecomposability of the RTM $M$ in terms of non-existence of idempotent quiver morphisms $\iota:T\to T$ satisfying $F\circ\iota=F$ and $\iota\neq 1_T$. Further, we provide an iterative method to decompose an RTM into indecomposable RTMs as well as a method to recursively construct indecomposable RTMs.</description>

      <title>On Rings with the 2-UNJ Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of rings calling them {\it 2-UNJ rings}, which generalize the well-known 2-UJ, 2-UU and UNJ rings. Specifically, a ring $R$ is called 2-UNJ if, for every unit $u$ of $R$, the inclusion $u^2 \in 1 + Nil(R) + J(R)$ holds, where $Nil(R)$ is the set of nilpotent elements and $J(R)$ is the Jacobson radical of $R$. We show that every 2-UJ, 2-UU or UNJ ring is 2-UNJ, but the converse does {\it not} necessarily hold, and we also provide counter-examples to demonstrate this explicitly. We, moreover, investigate the connections between these rings and other algebraic properties such as being potent, tripotent, regular and exchange rings, respectively. In particular, we thoroughly study some natural extensions, like matrix rings and Morita contexts, obtaining new characterizations that were not addressed in previous works. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which group rings satisfy the 2-UNJ property. These results not only provide a better understanding of the structure of 2-UNJ rings, but also pave the way for future intensive research in this area.</description>

      <title>Bounds on skew dimensions and characters of symmetric groups via thick hook decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bound the number of standard tableaux of skew shapes via thick hook decompositions in the Naruse hook length formula. Combining this with elementary counting arguments in the Murnaghan--Nakayama rule, we establish a uniform bound on characters of symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_n$. In the case of balanced representations, this improves on the character bounds of F\'eray and \'Sniady for permutations with support size at least $n^{2/3}$, and is sharp for permutations with support size of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Beyond endoscopy for $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with ramification 3: contribution of the elliptic part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to work on \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} for $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with ramification at $S = \{\infty, q_1, \dots, q_r\}$ (where $2 \in S$), generalizing the final step of Altu\u{g}'s work in the unramified setting. We derive an explicit asymptotic formula for the elliptic part when summing over $n&lt;X$ with arbitrary smooth test functions at places in $S$ for the standard representation. As a consequence, we obtain the desired limit for the simple trace formula which only occurs in the ramified case. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic formula for the traces of Hecke operators on cusp forms with arbitrary level and weight $&gt;2$, directly generalizing Altu\u{g}'s final result. Our approach differs entirely from Altu\u{g}'s: We apply a second Poisson summation with respect to the determinant, obtaining a formula on the Hitchin-Steinberg base $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$. By changing variables from $(T, N)$ to $(T, \Delta)$ on $\mathfrak{g}/\!/ \mathsf{G}$, we perform analysis in the new coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of extended Weyl groups $W$, which are reflection groups. Further we recall the definition of a hyperbolic cover of an extended Weyl group, and show that the hyperbolic covers of the extended Weyl groups are extended Coxeter groups, which had been introduced by Looijenga and discussed by people from different mathematical areas. More precisely the hyperbolic covers are the extended Coxeter groups of star type. We define simple reflections and Coxeter transformations in these groups, and show the transitivity of the Hurwitz action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of a Coxeter transformation in the extended Coxeter groups of star type $\mathcal{W}$, where the reflections are the conjugates of the simple reflections in $\mathcal{W}$. We give two applications of our results. In the context of representation theory of algebras, we establish an isomorphism between the poset of thick subcategories that are generated by exceptional sequences of a hereditary connected ext-finite abelian $k$-category with a tilting object, $k$ algebraically closed of characteristic $0$, and the poset of elements in the extended Weyl group that are below a Coxeter transformation with respect to the absolute order. The second application concerns the theory of unimodal singularities. In particular, we provide an answer to a question of Brieskorn for the classical monodromy operator in the case of hyperbolic singularities.</description>

Abstract: In a recent article, D. Kazhdan and A. Yom Din conjectured the validity of an asymptotic form of Schur's orthogonality for tempered irreducible unitary representations of semisimple groups defined over local fields. In the non-Archimedean case, they established such an orthogonality for $K$-finite matrix coefficients. Building on their work, and exploiting the admissibility of irreducible unitary representations, we prove the analogous result in the Archimedean case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parabolic induction producing $\ell$-adic sheaves on a parahoric subgroup scheme in the loop group of a reductive group. Under a genericity assumption on the input data, we prove that it produces conjugation equivariant perverse sheaves on the parahoric subgroup; this is upgraded to a $t$-exact equivalence of categories of $\ell$-adic sheaves. An iterative version of the construction produces such a perverse sheaf starting from a geometric analogue of the data considered by J.-K. Yu and J. Kim. We prove, under a mild condition on $q$, that generic parabolic induction from a parahoric torus realizes the character of the representation arising from the associated parahoric Deligne--Lusztig induction, which is known to parametrize the Fintzen--Kaletha--Spice twist of types. In the simplest interesting setting, our construction produces a simple perverse sheaf associated to a sufficiently nontrivial multiplicative local system on a torus, resolving a conjecture of Lusztig.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</description>

      <title>Generalised tree modules: Hom-sets and indecomposability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a zero-relation algebra over a field $\mathcal K$, Crawley-Boevey introduced the concept of a tree module and provided a combinatorial description of a basis for the space of homomorphisms between two tree modules--the basis elements are called graph maps. The indecomposability of tree modules is essentially due to Gabriel. We relax a condition in the definition of a tree module to define generalised tree modules and when $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, under a certain condition, provide a combinatorial description of a finite generating set for the space of homomorphisms between two such modules--we call the generators generalised graph maps. As an application, we provide a sufficient condition for the (in)decomposability of certain generalised tree modules. We also show that all indecomposable modules over a Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbf D$ are isomorphic to generalised tree modules--this result also follows from a theorem of Ringel which states that all exceptional modules over the path algebra $\mathcal KQ$ of a finite quiver $Q$ are generalised tree modules.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras: Finiteness and tameness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\operatorname{g}$-finite (resp., $\operatorname{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er.
  Futhermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, the converse of Reading's theorem is established: if the $\operatorname{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</description>

      <title>Tubular neighborhoods of local models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the v-sheaf local models of moduli spaces of $p$-adic shtukas are unibranch. In particular, this proves that the scheme-theoretic local models defined in our joint work with Ansch\"{u}tz and Richarz are always normal with reduced special fiber, thereby establishing the remaining cases of the geometric part of the Scholze$-$Weinstein conjecture when $p \leq 3$. Our methods are general, topological, and simplify Zhu's proof of the coherence conjecture. As a technical input, we generalize a comparison theorem of nearby cycles of Huber to the v-sheaf setup.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</description>

      <title>Higher Period Integrals and Derivatives of L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study higher analogues of Rankin--Selberg integrals for GL_n*GL_n-1 over function fields and relate the integral values to higher derivatives of unramified Rankin--Selberg L-functions. Our method reveals some relation between special cycle classes on Shtukas and the geometric conjectures of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh. It can be regarded as a first step towards a generalization of the higher Gross--Zagier formula of Yun--Zhang for higher-dimensional spherical varieties.</description>
