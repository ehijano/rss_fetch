      <title>Atomically thin obstructed atomic insulators with robust edge modes and quantized spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected edge states serve as direct evidence of nontrivial electronic topology in atomically thin materials. Finding these states in experimentally realizable single-phase materials presents a substantial challenge for their use for both fundamental studies and developing functional nanoscale devices. Here, we show the presence of robust edge states in phosphorene and group-Va monolayers with puckered lattice structures. By carefully analyzing the symmetry of the atomic sites and edge modes properties, we demonstrate that these atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials realize recently introduced obstructed atomic insulator states with partially occupied edge modes. The obstructed edge modes attain a Rashba-type spin splitting with Rashba parameter ($\alpha$) of 1.52 eV \r{A} for arsenene. Under strain or doping effects, these obstructed insulators transition to a phase with substantial spin-Berry curvature, yielding a double quantum spin Hall state with a spin Hall conductivity of 4$\frac{e^2}{h}$. The experimental availability of phosphorene and other group-Va materials featuring puckered lattice structures could enable verification of obstructed atomic states and enhanced spin-Berry curvature effects discussed in this study, offering the potential for applications in topological electronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>MSene: A new large family of two-dimensional transition metal sulfide with MXene structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, discovering new two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique properties and potential applications remains a focus in condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we report a new large family of transition metal sulfides M2S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-W2S is a SCTM which exhibits SC transition temperature (Tc) of 12.4 K and nontrivial topological properties as evidenced by topological invariant Z2=1 and the presence of edge states; 1T-Hf2S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr2S and 1T-Mn2S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Memristive switching in the surface of a charge-density-wave topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the outstanding properties provided by nontrivial band topology, topological phases of matter are considered as a promising platform towards low-dissipation electronics, efficient spin-charge conversion, and topological quantum computation. Achieving ferroelectricity in topological materials enables the non-volatile control of the quantum states, which could greatly facilitate topological electronic research. However, ferroelectricity is generally incompatible with systems featuring metallicity due to the screening effect of free carriers. In this study, we report the observation of memristive switching based on the ferroelectric surface state of a topological semimetal (TaSe4)2I. We find that the surface state of (TaSe4)2I presents out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization due to surface reconstruction. With the combination of ferroelectric surface and charge-density-wave-gapped bulk states, an electric switchable barrier height can be achieved in (TaSe4)2I-metal contact. By employing a multi-terminal grounding design, we manage to construct a prototype ferroelectric memristor based on (TaSe4)2I with on/off ratio up to 10^3, endurance over 10^3 cycles, and good retention characteristics. The origin of the ferroelectric surface state is further investigated by first-principles calculations, which reveals an interplay between ferroelectricity and band topology. The emergence of ferroelectricity in (TaSe4)2I not only demonstrates it as a rare but essential case of ferroelectric topological materials, but also opens new routes towards the implementation of topological materials in functional electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Adsorption-controlled epitaxy of perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose to use laser heating both for the substrate and the thermal evaporation sources in a vacuum chamber operating at pressures from XHV to values where the mean free path of the particles approaches or slightly exceeds the source-substrate distance. The concept combines the advantages of the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) methods to allow ultrapure deposition with continuous stoichiometry variation at high background pressures of arbitrary gases or molecular beams. Theory and preliminary experiments suggest that this setup is capable of growing complex oxides such as SrTiO$_3$ in the adsorption-controlled regime, similar to GaAs, in a background of molecular oxygen. This regime is neither accessible to MBE nor to PLD, making this laser epitaxy approach a unique tool to explore new growth regimes with the potential to fabricate structures such as modulation-doped heterostructures with low levels of background impurities that are impossible to synthesize with the current techniques. The technological simplicity and exceedingly compact size of the deposition chamber enable easy and rapid switching between different materials systems and the efficient synthesis of new materials that involve corrosive constituents. In contrast to PLD, the method may be scaled in a straightforward manner to large substrate sizes, providing a direct path from research to mass production.</description>

      <title>Large Bulk Photovoltaic Effect of Nitride Perovskite LaWN3 as Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: First Principles Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk photovoltaic effect in noncentrosymmetric materials is a fundamental and significant property that holds potential for high-efficiency energy harvesting, such as photoelectric application and photocatalysis. Here, based on first principles calculation, we explore the electronic structure, dielectric property, shift current, and photocatalytic performance of novel nitride perovskite LaWN3. Our calculations show that LaWN3 possesses large dielectric constants and shift current. The shift current can be enhanced by considering spin-orbit coupling and is switchable by ferroelectric polarization, which suggests LaWN3 is a promising candidate for logic and neuromorphic photovoltaic devices driven by ferroelectric polarization. Additionally, LaWN3 shows advanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction as a photocatalyst. Especially, the (110) surface represents low surface energy and Gibbes free energy, implying that the (110) surface may be exposed to the active surface. Our finding highlights potential applications of novel polar nitride perovskite LaWN3 in various fields not only photoelectric devices but also photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization in two-dimensional materials from high-throughput computational screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the orbital magnetization of 822 two-dimensional magnetic materials from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB). For compounds containing 5$d$ elements we find orbital moments of the order of 0.3-0.5 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, which points to the necessity of including these in any type of magnetic modeling and comparison with experiments. It is also shown that the alignment of orbital moments with respect to the spin largely follows the predictions from Hund's rule and that deviations may be explained by the $d$-band splitting originating from the crystal field - for example in the important case of CrI$_3$. Finally, we show that for certain insulators, Hubbard corrections may lead to large and fully unquenched orbital moments that are pinned to the lattice rather than the spin and that these moments can lead to enormous magnetic anisotropies. Such unquenched ground states are only found from density functional theory calculations that include both Hubbard corrections and self-consistent spin-orbit coupling and largely invalidates the use of the magnetic force theorem for calculating magnetic anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface of the chiral topological semimetal CoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the Fermi surface of the chiral semimetal CoSi and its relationship to a network of multifold topological crossing points,Weyl points, and topological nodal planes in the electronic band structure. Combining quantum oscillations in the Hall resistivity, magnetization, and torque magnetization with ab initio electronic structure calculations, we identify two groups of Fermi-surface sheets, one centered at the R point and the other centered at the $\Gamma$ point. The presence of topological nodal planes at the Brillouin zone boundary enforces topological protectorates on the Fermi-surface sheets centered at the R point. In addition, Weyl points exist close to the Fermi-surface sheets centered at the R and the $\Gamma$ points. In contrast, topological crossing points at the R point and the $\Gamma$ point, which have been advertised to feature exceptionally large Chern numbers, are located at a larger distance to the Fermi level. Representing a unique example in which the multitude of topological band crossings has been shown to form a complex network, our observations in CoSi highlight the need for detailed numerical calculations of the Berry curvature at the Fermi level, regardless of the putative existence and the possible character of topological band crossings in the band structure.</description>

      <title>Molecular Identification via Molecular Fingerprint extraction from Atomic Force Microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non--Contact Atomic Force Microscopy with CO--functionalized metal tips (referred to as HR-AFM) provides access to the internal structure of individual molecules adsorbed on a surface with totally unprecedented resolution. Previous works have shown that deep learning (DL) models can retrieve the chemical and structural information encoded in a 3D stack of constant-height HR--AFM images, leading to molecular identification. In this work, we overcome their limitations by using a well-established description of the molecular structure in terms of topological fingerprints, the 1024--bit Extended Connectivity Chemical Fingerprints of radius 2 (ECFP4), that were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs provide local structural information of the molecule, each bit correlating with a particular substructure within the molecule. Our DL model is able to extract this optimized structural descriptor from the 3D HR--AFM stacks and use it, through virtual screening, to identify molecules from their predicted ECFP4 with a retrieval accuracy on theoretical images of 95.4\%. Furthermore, this approach, unlike previous DL models, assigns a confidence score, the Tanimoto similarity, to each of the candidate molecules, thus providing information on the reliability of the identification.
  By construction, the number of times a certain substructure is present in the molecule is lost during the hashing process, necessary to make them useful for machine learning applications. We show that it is possible to complement the fingerprint-based virtual screening with global information provided by another DL model that predicts from the same HR--AFM stacks the chemical formula, boosting the identification accuracy up to a 97.6\%. Finally, we perform a limited test with experimental images, obtaining promising results towards the application of this pipeline under real conditions</description>

      <title>A first-principles study of structural, elastic, electronic, and transport properties of Cs2Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit to operate photocathodes at high accelerating gradients to increase brightness of electron beams is gaining interests within the accelerator community. Cesium telluride (Cs2Te) is a widely used photocathode material and it is presumed to offer resilience to higher gradients because of its wider band gap compared to other semiconductors. Despite its advantages, crucial material properties of Cs2Te remain largely unknown both in theory and experiments. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to provide detailed structural, elastic, electronic and transport properties of Cs2Te. It is found that Cs2Te has an intrinsic mobility of 20 cm2/Vs for electrons and 2.0 cm2/Vs for holes at room temperature. The low mobility is primarily limited by the strong polar optical phonon scattering. Cs2Te also exhibits ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.2 W/(m*K) at room temperature. Based on the energy gain/loss balance under external field and electron-phonon scattering, we predict that Cs2Te has a dielectric breakdown field in the range from ~60 MV/m to ~132 MV/m at room temperature dependent on the doping level of Cs2Te. Our results are crucial to advance the understanding of applicability of Cs2Te photocathodes for high-gradient operation.</description>

      <title>First-principles and cluster expansion study of the effect of magnetism on short-range order in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range order (SRO) alters the mechanical properties of technologically relevant structural materials such as medium/high entropy alloys and austenitic stainless steels. In this study, we present a generalized spin cluster expansion (CE) model and show that magnetism is a primary factor influencing the level of SRO present in austenitic Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. The spin CE consists of a chemical cluster expansion combined with an Ising model for Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. It explicitly accounts for local magnetic exchange interactions, thereby capturing the effects of finite temperature magnetism on SRO. Model parameters are obtained by fitting to a first-principles data set comprising both chemically and magnetically diverse FCC configurations. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange interactions are found to be comparable to the chemical interactions. Compared to a conventional implicit magnetism CE built from only magnetic ground state configurations, the spin CE shows improved performance on several experimental benchmarks over a broad spectrum of compositions, particularly at higher temperatures due to the explicit treatment of magnetic disorder. We find that SRO is strongly influenced by alloy Cr content, since Cr atoms prefer to align antiferromagnetically with nearest neighbors but become magnetically frustrated with increasing Cr concentration. We predict that increasing the Cr concentration in typical austenitic stainless steels promotes the formation of SRO and increases order-disorder transition temperatures. This study underscores the significance of considering magnetic interactions explicitly when exploring the thermodynamic properties of complex transition metal alloys. It also highlights guidelines for customizing SRO through adjustments of alloy composition.</description>

      <title>Flexibility and regularity of the hydration structure of a sodium ion. Nonempirical insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stationary nonempirical simulations of Na+(H2O)n clusters with n in a range of 28 to 51 carried out at the density functional level with a hybrid B3LYP functional and the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics modeling of the size selected clusters reveal the interrelated structural and energetic peculiarities of sodium hydration structures. Surface, bulk, and transient configurations of the clusters are distinguished with the different location of the sodium nucleus (close to either the spatial center of the structure or one of its side faces) and its consistently changing coordination number (which typically equals five or six). The &lt;rNaO&gt; mean Na-O distances for the first-shell water molecules are found to depend both on the spatial character of the structure and the local coordination of sodium. The &lt;rNaO&gt; values are compared to different experimental estimates, and the virtual discrepancy of the latter is explained based on the results of the cluster simulations. Different coordination neighborhoods of sodium are predicted depending on its local fraction in the actual specimens.</description>

      <title>Topologically trivial gap-filling in superconducting Fe(Se,Te) by one dimensional defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural distortions and imperfections are a crucial aspect of materials science, on the macroscopic scale providing strength, but also enhancing corrosion and reducing electrical and thermal conductivity. At the nanometre scale, multi-atom imperfections, such as atomic chains and crystalline domain walls have conversely been proposed as a route to topological superconductivity, whose most prominent characteristic is the emergence of Majorana Fermions that can be used for error-free quantum computing. Here, we shed more light on the nature of purported domain walls in Fe(Se,Te) that may host 1D dispersing Majorana modes. We show that the displacement shift of the atomic lattice at these line-defects results from sub-surface impurities that warp the topmost layer(s). Using the electric field between the tip and sample, we manage to reposition the sub-surface impurities, directly visualizing the displacement shift and the underlying defect-free lattice. These results, combined with observations of a completely different type of 1D defect where superconductivity remains fully gapped, highlight the topologically trivial nature of 1D defects in Fe(Se,Te).</description>

      <title>Band structure engineering using a moir\'e polar substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying long wavelength periodic potentials on quantum materials has recently been demonstrated to be a promising pathway for engineering novel quantum phases of matter. Here, we utilize twisted bilayer boron nitride (BN) as a moir\'e substrate for band structure engineering. Small-angle-twisted bilayer BN is endowed with periodically arranged up and down polar domains, which imprints a periodic electrostatic potential on a target two-dimensional (2D) material placed on top. As a proof of concept, we use Bernal bilayer graphene as the target material. The resulting modulation of the band structure appears as superlattice resistance peaks, tunable by varying the twist angle, and Hofstadter butterfly physics under a magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate the tunability of the moir\'e potential by altering the dielectric thickness underneath the twisted BN. Finally, we find that near-60{\deg}-twisted bilayer BN provides a unique platform for studying the moir\'e structural effect without the contribution from electrostatic moir\'e potentials. Tunable moir\'e polar substrates may serve as versatile platforms to engineer the electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Analytical Interaction Potential for Lennard-Jones Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical form has been derived using Ostrogradski's integration method for the interaction between two thin rods of finite lengths in arbitrary relative configurations in a 3-dimensional space, each treated as a line of material points interacting through the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Simplified analytical forms for coplanar, parallel, and collinear rods are also derived. Exact expressions for the force and torque between the rods are obtained. Similar results for a point particle interacting with a thin rod are provided.

      <description>arXiv:2405.03944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact analytical form is derived via an integration approach for the interaction between a sphere and a thin rod of both finite and infinite lengths, with each object treated as a continuous medium of materials points interacting by the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Expressions for the resultant forces and torques are obtained. Various asymptotic limits of the analytical sphere-rod potential are discussed.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Gate-tunable Capacitance in Graphene Moir\'e Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface engineered ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures is of broad interest both fundamentally and technologically for the applications in neuromorphic computing and so on. In particular, the moir\'e ferroelectricity in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures driven by charge ordering instead of traditional lattice displacement has drawn considerable attention because of its fascinating properties and promising high-frequency programmable electrical polarization switching. Yet, the underlying mechanism of the electronic ferroelectricity is still under debate. On the other hand, combining the interface engineered ferroelectricity and strong correlations in moir\'e heterostructures could enable the realization of novel quantum states such as ferroelectric superconductivity and multiferroicity. Here we study the electronic transport properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG), aligned with one of the neighbouring hBN. We observe a strong gating hysteresis and ferroelectric-like behaviour, as well as the electronic ratchet effect. We find that the top gate is anomalously screened. On the contrary, the back gate is anomalously doubly efficient in injecting charges into graphene, that is, the effective back gate capacitance is two times larger than its geometry capacitance. This unexpected gate-tunable capacitance causes a dramatic change of electric fields between forward and backward scans. The asymmetric gating behaviours and anomalous change in capacitance could be explained with a simple model involved with a spontaneous electric polarization between top hBN and graphene. Our work provides more insights into the mysterious ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN moir\'e heterostructures and paves the way to the understanding of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity multipole order in the spin-orbit coupled metallic pyrochlore Pb$_2$Re$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pyrochlore oxide Pb2Re2O7-{\delta} (PRO) is a candidate spin-orbit-coupled metal (SOCM) that exhibits a structural phase transition with inversion symmetry breaking. In this study, we report the results of detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on single crystals of PRO to clarify the crystal structure below the phase transition temperature at Ts = 300 K. In the XRD patterns, a clear peak splitting is observed below Ts, indicating a cubic to tetragonal transition. Based on the group-subgroup relationship and the observed reflection conditions, the space group of the low-temperature phase is proposed to be I4122, which agrees with optical second harmonic generation measurements. This space group is the same as that of the lowest temperature structure of the analogous SOCM Cd2Re2O7 (CRO), which is realized by the emergence of odd-parity multipole order. The comparison between PRO and CRO allows for advancing our understanding on the symmetry-lowering complex order exhibited by SOCMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds are typically treated as sufficiently localized directional intermolecular bonds, in which dispersion and electrostatic contributions can be distinguished. However, being formed chiefly due to the overlapping of p orbitals of electronegative atoms, the corresponding electronic bonds are characterized by both {\sigma}- and {\pi}-kind binding, the former determining the directionality of bonds, while the latter, the coupling of molecules and the collective effects in H-bond networks. The latter contribution was never considered previously and is predetermined by overlapping pre-lone pair orbitals of oxygen atoms. This is manifested in the peculiarities of the electron density distribution, which are quantified based on the analysis of magnetic shielding tensors of oxygen and bridge hydrogen nuclei and illustrated by the shapes of cluster orbitals of water aggregates.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Curie temperature in single crystalline ferromagnetic LaCrGe$_3$ by electron irradiation-induced disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LaCrGe$_3$ has attracted attention as a potential candidate for studies of quantum phase transitions in a ferromagnetic material. The application of pressure avoids a quantum critical point by developing a new magnetic phase. It was suggested that the disorder may provide an alternative route to a quantum critical point. We used low-temperature 2.5 MeV electron irradiation to induce relatively small amounts of point-like disorder in single crystals of LaCrGe$_3$. Irradiation leads to an increase of the resistivity at all temperatures with some deviation from the Matthiessen rule. Hall effect measurements show that electron irradiation does not cause any detectable change in the carrier density. Unexpectedly, the Curie temperature, $T_{\text{FM}}$, \emph{increases} with the increase of disorder from approximately 90 K in pristine samples up to nearly 100 K in the heavily irradiated sample, with a tendency towards saturation at higher doses. Although the mechanism of this effect is not entirely clear, we conclude that it cannot be caused by effective ``doping" or ``pressure" due to electron irradiation. We suggest that disorder-induced broadening of a sharp peak in the density of states, $D(E)$, situated at $E_p=E_F-0.25$ eV below the Fermi energy, $E_F$, causes an increase in $D(E_F)$, leading to an enhancement of $T_\text{FM}$ in this itinerant ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Stable and low loss oxide layer on {\alpha}-Ta (110) film for superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of amorphous oxide layers can significantly affect the coherent time of superconducting qubits due to their high dielectric loss. Typically, the surface oxides of superconductor films exhibit lossy and unstable behavior when exposed to air. To increase the coherence time, it is essential for qubits to have stable and low dielectric loss oxides, either as barrier or passivation layers. In this study, we highlight the robust and stable nature of an amorphous tantalum oxide layer formed on {\alpha}-Ta (110) film by employing chemical and structural analyses. Such kind of oxide layer forms in a self-limiting process on the surface of {\alpha}-Ta (110) film in piranha solution, yielding stable thickness and steady chemical composition. Quarter wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators are made to study the loss of this oxide. One resonator has a Qi of 3.0x10^6 in the single photon region. The Qi of most devices are higher than 2.0x10^6. Moreover, most of them are still over 1x10^6 even after exposed to air for months. Based on these findings, we propose an all-tantalum superconducting qubit utilizing such oxide as passivation layers, which possess low dielectric loss and improved stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in machine-learning methods have led to the emergence of machine-learning-based interatomic potentials as a new cutting-edge tool for simulating large systems with ab initio accuracy. Still, the community awaits universal inter-atomic models that can be applied to a wide range of materials without tuning neural network parameters. We develop a unified deep-learning inter-atomic potential (the DPA-Semi model) for 19 semiconductors ranging from group IIB to VIA, including Si, Ge, SiC, BAs, BN, AlN, AlP, AlAs, InP, InAs, InSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, CdTe, InTe, CdSe, ZnS, and CdS. In addition, independent deep potential models for each semiconductor are prepared for detailed comparison. The training data are obtained by performing density functional theory calculations with numerical atomic orbitals basis sets to reduce the computational costs. We systematically compare various properties of the solid and liquid phases of semiconductors between different machine-learning models. We conclude that the DPA-Semi model achieves GGA exchange-correlation functional quality accuracy and can be regarded as a pre-trained model towards a universal model to study group IIB to VIA semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Nanostructured ferroelectrics display exotic multidomain configurations resulting from the electrostatic and elastic boundary conditions they are subject to. While the ferroelectric domains appear frozen in experimental images, atomistic second-principles studies suggest that they may become spontaneously mobile upon heating, with the polar order {\sl melting} in a liquid-like fashion. Here we run molecular dynamics simulations of model systems (PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices) to study the unique features of this transformation. Most notably, we find that the multidomain state looses its translational and orientational orders at different temperatures, resembling the behavior of liquid crystals and yielding an intermediate hexatic-like phase. Our simulations reveal the mechanism responsible for the melting and allow us to characterize the stochastic dynamics in the hexatic-like phase: we find evidence that it is thermally activated, with domain reorientation rates that grow from tens of gigahertzs to terahertzs in a narrow temperature window.</description>

      <title>Giant electrode effect on tunneling magnetoresistance and electroresistance in van der Waals intrinsic multiferroic tunnel junctions using VS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) with multiple nonvolatile resistive states are highly suitable for new physics and next-generation storage electronics. However, currently reported vdW-MFTJs are based on two types of materials, i.e., vdW ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, forming a multiferroic system. This undoubtedly introduces additional interfaces, increasing the complexity of experimental preparation. Herein, we engineer vdW intrinsic MFTJs utilizing bilayer VS$_2$. By employing the nonequilibrium Green's function combined with density functional theory, we systematically investigate the influence of three types of electrodes (including non-vdW pure metal Ag/Au, vdW metallic 1T-MoS$_2$/2H-PtTe$_2$, and vdW ferromagnetic metallic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$) on the electronic transport properties of VS$_2$-based intrinsic MFTJs. We demonstrate that these MFTJs manifest a giant electrode-dependent electronic transport characteristic effect. Comprehensively comparing these electrode pairs, the Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ electrode combination exhibits optimal transport properties, the maximum TMR (TER) can reach 10949\% (69\%) and the minimum resistance-area product (RA) is 0.45 $\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$, as well as the perfect spin filtering and negative differential resistance effects. More intriguingly, TMR (TER) can be further enhanced to 34000\% (380\%) by applying an external bias voltage (0.1 V), while RA can be reduced to 0.16 $\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$ under the influence of biaxial stress (-3\%). Our proposed concept of designing vdW-MFTJs using intrinsic multiferroic materials points towards new avenues in experimental exploration.</description>

We present colossal $S$ and large thermal electron motivate force (EMF) reproduced by space charge (SC) model, introducing multi-Debye lengths within grain boundaries (GBs) of TE materials with phonon drag (PD) effect accompanying with electron by electron-phonon interaction. In addition to $S$, the polarity reversal was also reproduced by transfer process with inner bias around SP generated from thermal EMF. Colossal $S$ and EMF for TE material were reproduced by inner SC model as a functions of averaged multi-Debye length within GBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method for dark field imaging is introduced which uses scanned electron diffraction (or 4DSTEM - 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy datasets) as its input. Instead of working on simple summation of intensity, it works on a sparse representation of the diffraction patterns in terms of a list of their diffraction peaks. This is tested on a thin perovskite film containing structural ordering resulting in additional superlattice spots that reveal details of domain structures, and is shown to give much better selectivity and contrast than conventional virtual dark field imaging. It is also shown to work well in polycrystalline aggregates of CuO nanoparticles. In view of the higher contrast and selectivity, and the complete exclusion of diffuse scattering from the image formation, it is expected to be of significant benefit for characterisation of a wide variety of crystalline materials.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum spin liquid.</description>

Abstract: Realization of practical superconducting quantum computing requires many qubits of long coherence time. Compared to the commonly used Ta deposited on c-plane sapphire, which occasionally form {\alpha}-Ta (111) grains and \b{eta}-tantalum grains, high quality Ta (110) film can grow epitaxial on a-plane sapphire because of the atomic relationships at the interface. Well-ordered {\alpha}-Ta (110) film on wafer-scale a-plane sapphire has been prepared. The film exhibits high residual resistance ratio. Transmon qubits fabricated using these film shows relaxation times exceeding 150 {\mu}s. The results suggest Ta film on a-plane sapphire is a promising choice for long coherence time qubit on wafer scale.</description>

Abstract: Generating a pure spin current using electrons, which have degrees of freedom beyond spin, such as electric charge and valley index, presents challenges. In response, we propose a novel mechanism based on intervalley exciton dynamics in {\em arc-shaped} strained transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to achieve the {\em exciton spin Hall effect} in an electrically insulating regime, without the need for an external electric field. The interplay between strain gradients and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields results in a net Lorentz force on long-lived intervalley excitons in WSe$_2$, carrying non-zero spin angular momentum. This process generates an exciton-mediated pure spin Hall current, resulting in opposite-sign spin accumulations and local magnetization on the two sides of the single-layer arc-shaped TMD. We demonstrate that the magnetic field induced by spin accumulation, at approximately $\sim {\rm mT}$, can be detected using techniques such as superconducting quantum interference magnetometry or spatially-resolved magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr rotations.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture in soft solids</title>

Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>
