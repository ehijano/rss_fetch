      <title>Observation of Temperature-Dependent Capture Cross-Section for Main Deep-Levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct observation of capture cross-section is challenging due to the need of extremely short filling pulses in the two-gate Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). Simple estimation of cross-section can be done from DLTS and Admittance Spectroscopy (AS) data, but it is not feasible to distinguish temperature dependence of pre-exponential and exponential parts of the emission rate equation with sufficient precision conducting a single experiment. This paper presents experimental data of deep-levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3 that has been gathered by our group since 2017. Based on the gathered data we propose a derivation of apparent activation energy ($E_a^m$) and capture cross-section ($\sigma_n^m$) assuming temperature dependent capture via multiphonon emission model, which resulted in strong correlation between $E_a^m$ and $\sigma_n^m$ according to Meyer-Neldel rule, which allowed us to estimate low- and high-temperature capture coefficients $C_0$ and $C_1$ as well as capture barrier $E_b$. It also has been shown that without considering the temperature dependence of capture cross-section, the experimental values of $\sigma_n$ are overestimated by 1-3 orders of magnitude. A careful consideration of the data also allows to be more certain identifying deep-levels by their "fingerprints" ($E_a$ and $\sigma_n$) considering two additional parameters ($E_{MN}$ and $\sigma_{00}$) and to verify the density functional theory (DFT) computation of deep-level recombination properties.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile multi-state electrothermal resistive switching in a strongly correlated insulator thin-film device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated insulators, such as Mott or charge-transfer insulators, exhibit a strong temperature dependence in their resistivity. Consequently, self-heating effects can lead to electrothermal instabilities in planar thin film devices of these materials. When the electrical bias current exceeds a device-specific threshold, the device can switch from a high- to a low-resistance state through the formation of metallic filaments. However, since the current and temperature redistribution effects that create these filaments are sustained by local Joule heating, a reduction of the bias current below a second (lower) threshold leads to the disappearance of filaments, and the device switches back into the high-resistance state. Hence, electrothermal resistive switching is usually volatile. Here, on the contrary, we report on non-volatile resistive switching in a planar $\mathrm{NdNiO}_3$ thin-film device. By combining electrical transport measurements with optical wide-field microscopy, we provide evidence for a metallic filament that persists even after returning the bias current to zero. We attribute this effect to the pronounced hysteresis between the cooling and heating branches in the resistance vs. temperature dependence of the device. At least one hundred intermediate resistance states can be prepared, which are persistent as long as the base temperature is kept constant. Further, the switching process is non-destructive, and thermal cycling can reset the device to its pristine state.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum impact on light scattering by phonons tested experimentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized Raman spectra of piezoelectric bismuth germanate single crystal were recorded using vortex light in order to verify the predicted symmetry selection rules for Raman scattering of photons with nonzero orbital angular momentum. At first, the phonon spectrum is fully characterized by the infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering with ordinary light. Then, vortex light Raman spectra were compared with the ordinary ones, but no influence of the orbital momentum on the Raman spectra of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$ was observed. In particular, we experimentally negate the theoretical prediction that Raman scattering using vortex light can yield frequencies of the silent optic modes of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$. We also have not seen evidence for the predicted symmetry-lowering of the Raman scattering tensors of $E$ modes. We propose that the orbital momentum effects are inaccessible to the ordinary Raman spectroscopy experiments because of the tiny magnitudes of typical phonon coherence lengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in magnon frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made for the emerging concept of magnon frequency comb (MFC) but mainly in the classical region. The quantum property of the comb structure is yet to be explored. Here we theoretically investigate the quantum fluctuations of frequency combs and demonstrate the continuous-variable quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between different teeth of MFC. Without loss of generality, we address this issue in a hybrid magnon-skyrmion system. We observe a strong two-mode squeezed entanglement and asymmetric steering between the sum- and difference-frequency magnon teeth mediated by the skyrmion that acts as an effective reservoir to cool the Bogoliubov mode delocalized over the first-order magnon pair in MFC. Our findings show the prominent quantum nature of MFC, which has the potential to be utilized in ultrafast quantum metrology and multi-task quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>
