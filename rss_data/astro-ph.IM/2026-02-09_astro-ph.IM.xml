      <title>Correlation Calibration: A Hybrid Calibration Technique for Radio Interferometric Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating out per-antenna signal chain effects is an essential step in analyzing radio interferometric data. For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of a Neural Network as a Bridge Between Galaxy Simulations and Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the stellar masses of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, originally derived via stellar population synthesis modelling, can be accurately predicted using only their absolute magnitudes and colour indices. A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Joint optical-digital design strategy for adaptive optics systems: application to wavelength selection for satellite imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics can be used to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on imaging systems, but the correction is only partial, and deconvolution is often required to improve the resolution. This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its annual conference in 2025, the French Society of Astronomy \&amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fifth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French A\&amp;A research community. During the 2025 workshop, the goal was to review four contemporary topics within the context of environmental transition actions and discussions: (1) institutional actions, (2) the early-career researchers singularity, (3) research infrastructures and tools, and (4) the geopolitical conditions under which A\&amp;A research remains possible. The workshop concluded with a round-table discussion that brought together the various speakers so that every participant could express their ideas.</description>

      <title>Mobile neutron monitor for latitude cosmic ray monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron monitors are a standard tool for high-precision continuous monitoring of galactic cosmic ray flux variations arising from variations in heliospheric conditions and solar activity for space weather applications. These measurements form the basis for solving the inverse problem of determining the cosmic ray anisotropy vector beyond the magnetosphere. To support such studies, periodic latitude measurements are necessary to determine the coupling functions of primary and secondary cosmic rays variations. The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel.</description>

      <title>Introducing a new generation Adaptive Optics simulation framework: from PASSATA to SPECULA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical end-to-end simulation in Adaptive Optics (AO) is a key tool in the development of complex systems, from the initial design to the commissioning phase. Based on our previous experience with PASSATA, we decided to develop a new AO simulation framework in Python language, naming it SPECULA (short for: Scalable Parallel Execution of Computations Upscaling Large Adaptive optics simulations). Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future.</description>

      <title>Antenna for the detection of electromagnetic audio-band disturbances on-board LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LISA mission will be the first observatory to detect gravitational waves from space within the millihertz frequency band. Magnetic forces have an important impact on the instrument's sensitivity below the millihertz. Hence, monitoring the magnetic environment within each of the LISA spacecrafts is of utmost importance. In this Letter we present the characterization of the coils that were used in LISA Pathfinder (LPF) when operating as magnetic sensors in the audio frequency band. The necessity of implementing this type of magnetometer is presented in order to monitor high frequency magnetic signals from the electronics on-board. We show that the LPF coils have a performance one order of magnitude better than the current requirements set by the LISA mission at the low end of the audio-band frequency. The LPF coils are able to measure a magnetic noise level of 1.45 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 50 Hz and 0.17 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 500 Hz. Additionally, the LPF coils can reach a magnetic noise floor of 0.1 $\rm pT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at frequencies above 1 kHz.</description>

      <title>Simulated LSST Observations of Real Metre-scale Impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using real metre-sized asteroid Earth impactors from the last decade, we ask the question: ``If the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Polarization Beam Response of SPT-3G Using Point Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of cosmic microwave background polarization require rigorous control of instrumental systematics. For the South Pole Telescope's third-generation camera (SPT-3G), accurate characterization of the beam is critical for understanding the polarized mm-wave sky. Here, we present direct measurements of SPT-3G's polarized beam response using observations of 100 polarized extragalactic point sources. Previous SPT-3G CMB power spectrum analyses introduced a phenomenological parameter $\beta_\mathrm{pol}$ to describe the degree of polarization preserved in beam sidelobes. These analyses found evidence for significant depolarization driven by the requirement of polarization power spectrum consistency between different frequency bands. Our direct measurements yield $\beta_\mathrm{pol}=0.90\pm0.10$ at 95 GHz, $1.01\pm0.12$ at 150 GHz, and $0.81\pm0.29$ at 220 GHz, indicating minimal sidelobe depolarization. We validate these results through extensive systematic tests including Bayesian posterior sampling versus frequentist bootstrap resampling, real-space versus Fourier-space analysis, and variations on temperature-to-polarization leakage handling, covariance determination, and source selection. When compared to values inferred from previous cosmological analyses, which favored significant depolarization to resolve inter-frequency power spectrum inconsistencies, we find a mild tension of $1.9\sigma$. However, this apparent discrepancy is dependent on the beam modeling, as our point source-based analysis derives much of its constraining power on $\beta_\mathrm{pol}$ from higher multipoles than the power spectrum analysis. These measurements therefore admit three explanations for the frequency-dependent residuals observed in the power spectrum analysis: a statistical fluctuation, the need for more sophisticated polarized beam models, or systematics other than beam depolarization.</description>

      <title>The effect of JWST/NIRSpec data reduction on the retrieval of WASP-39b atmospheric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JWST provides exoplanet transit observations with unprecedented spectral coverage, enabling detailed atmospheric characterisation. However, systematics introduced during data reduction can lead to small but significant uncertainties that propagate into atmospheric retrievals, making it essential to assess their impact on inferred properties.
  We aim to quantify the impact of different JWST/NIRSpec PRISM data-reduction processes as well as the relevance of saturation on the retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b. We also assess whether or not these biases are comparable to those introduced by assumptions made in atmospheric modelling, particularly in the treatment of aerosol extinction.
  We perform nested-sampling Bayesian retrievals using MultiNest and forward models generated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator. Six independently reduced spectra are analysed, considering both the full wavelength range and versions excluding the saturated region. We further test the effect of including three different cloud-opacity parameterisations.
  Differences among JWST/NIRSpec data-reduction pipelines lead to substantial variations in retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b, often exceeding one order of magnitude, comparable to uncertainties from modelling assumptions. Excluding the saturated region reduces inter-pipeline dispersion but increases parameter degeneracies. This highlights the need for robust and homogeneous calibration strategies. The results also confirm that JWST data possess the sensitivity required to probe aerosol spectral behaviour, although such constraints remain strongly dependent on the adopted data-reduction strategy.</description>

      <title>Accelerating TTL noise post-processing via combined coefficients and alternative TDI configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) noise induced by angular jitter of spacecraft and test masses can affect the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizations have become an indispensable part of the scientific process. A vibrant ecosystem of visualization tools exists, catering to a wide variety of different needs. Real-time visualizations of numerical simulations offer scientists immediate feedback about the status of their simulations and can also be valuable educational and outreach tools. Developing a visualization tool with support for different operating systems, CPU/GPU architectures, and programming languages can be a challenge. It is common to use one or more graphics or UI libraries to act as abstraction layers and hide the underlying complexity. Whereas external libraries greatly simplify the initial programming effort, we argue that relying on them introduces new dependencies and problems, such as a higher entry barriers for new developers and users, and uncertainty regarding long-term support. In this paper we present a new approach for real time visualizations which we have implemented for the N-body package REBOUND. We propose to use a web browser to handle GPU accelerated rendering. This enables us to offer 3D, interactive visualizations on all major operating systems. What makes our new approach unique is that we achieve this without the need for any external libraries. We utilize WebAssembly to reuse existing OpenGL visualization code. Using communication via HTTP and a custom built-in web server, we are able to provide both local and remote real time visualizations. In addition to the browser based real time visualization, our approach offers other additional operating modes, including simulations running entirely within the browser, visualizations within jupyter notebooks, and traditional standalone visualizations using OpenGL. We focus on the implementation in REBOUND but the concepts and ideas discussed can be applied to many other areas in need of scientific and non-scientific real time visualizations.</description>

      <title>Sensipy: simulate gamma-ray observations of transient astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present sensipy, an open-source Python toolkit for simulating observations of transient astrophysical sources, particularly in the high-energy (HE, keV-GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, GeV-TeV) gamma-ray ranges. The most explosive events in our universe are often short-lived, emitting the bulk of their energy in a relatively narrow time window. Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms. This information can further help to justify the feasibility of proposed observations, estimate detection rates (events/year) for various classes of sources, and provide scheduling insight in realtime during gamma-ray and multi-messenger observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>Astrometric follow-up of near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 during a Torino scale level 3 alert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of 2024 YR4 presented the planetary defense community with the most significant impact threat in almost two decades, reaching level 3 on the Torino scale. The community, now mature and well-organized, responded with a global observational effort. Astrometric measurements, forming the basis for orbital refinement and impact prediction, were a central component of this response. In this paper, we present the astrometric data collected by the international community, from the time of discovery until the object became too faint for all existing observational assets, including JWST. We also discuss the coordination role played by the International Asteroid Warning Network, and the importance of publicly available image archives to enable precovery searches.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Characterization of the 220/280 GHz TES Detector Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new suite of cosmic microwave background telescopes in the Chilean Atacama Desert with an extensive science program spanning cosmology, Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and particle physics. SO will survey the millimeter-wave sky over a wide range of angular scales using six spectral bands across three types of dichroic, polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detector modules: Low-Frequency (LF) modules with bandpasses centered near 30 and 40 GHz, Mid-Frequency (MF) modules near 90 and 150 GHz, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) modules near 220 and 280 GHz. Twenty-five UHF detector modules, each containing 1720 optically-coupled TESs connected to microwave SQUID multiplexing readout, have now been produced. This work summarizes the pre-deployment characterization of these detector modules in laboratory cryostats. Across all UHF modules, we find an average operable TES yield of 83%, equating to over 36,000 devices tested. The distributions of (220, 280) GHz saturation powers have medians of (24, 26) pW, near the centers of their target ranges. For both bands, the median optical efficiency is 0.6, the median effective time constant is 0.4 ms, and the median dark noise-equivalent power (NEP) is ~40 aW/rtHz. The expected photon NEPs at (220, 280) GHz are (64, 99) aW/rtHz, indicating these detectors will achieve background-limited performance on the sky. Thirty-nine UHF and MF detector modules are currently operating in fielded SO instruments, which are transitioning from the commissioning stage to full science observations.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a near-infrared time-domain survey instrument operating on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for wide-field science in the near infrared without cryogenically cooled optics or detectors. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 deg^2 field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>ECHO21: a tool for modelling global 21-cm signal from dark ages to reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Python package called ECHO21 for modelling the global 21-cm signal from the dark ages through cosmic dawn to the end of reionization. Leveraging its analytical framework, ECHO21 generates a single model in $\mathcal{O}(1)\,$s, allowing a large number of signals to be generated efficiently by distributing models across multiple cores. Thus, it is ideal for performing astrophysical or cosmological inference from a given 21-cm dataset. We offer six astrophysical parameters that control the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emissivity, X-ray emissivity, emissivity of ionizing photons, and star formation rate. Beyond its efficiency some of the attractive and novel features in ECHO21 relative to previously published codes are inclusion of Ly$\alpha$ heating, ability to vary the standard cosmological parameters as easily as the astrophysical parameters, and different models of star formation rate density (physically-motivated, a semi-empirical, and an empirically-motivated). With a number of 21-cm experiments soon to provide cosmic dawn 21-cm data, ECHO21 is a flexible and extensible new open-source package for making quick but sufficiently realistic astrophysical inferences. We make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Transformation of orientation and rotation angles of synchronous satellites: Application to the Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orientation and rotation of a synchronous satellite can be referred to both its Laplace plane and the ICRF equatorial plane, in terms of Euler angles or spin axis Cartesian coordinates and Earth equatorial coordinates, respectively. We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data.</description>
