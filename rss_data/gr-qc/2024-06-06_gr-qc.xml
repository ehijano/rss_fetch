      <title>A new conformal quasi-local energy in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new conserved quasi-local energies in general relativity using the formalism developed by \cite{CWY}. In particular, we use the optimal isometric embedding defined in \cite{yau,yau1} to transplant the conformal Killing fields of the Minkowski space back to the $ 2-$ surface of interest in the physical spacetime. For an asymptotically flat spacetime of order $1$, we show that these energies are always finite. Their limit as the total energies of an isolated system is evaluated and a conservation law under Einsteinian evolution is deduced.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with Barrow Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the warm inflation mechanism in the presence of the Barrow holographic dark energy model. Warm inflation differs from other forms of inflation primarily in that it makes the assumption that radiation and inflaton exist and interact throughout the inflationary process. After the warming process, energy moves from the inflaton to the radiation as a result of the interaction, keeping the cosmos warm. Here we have set up the warm inflationary mechanism using Barrow holographic dark energy as the driving agent. Warm inflation has been explored in a high dissipative regime and interesting results have been obtained. It is seen that the Barrow holographic dark energy can successfully drive a warm inflationary scenario in the early universe. Finally, the model has been compared with the observational data and compliance has been found.</description>

      <title>Knotted 4-regular graphs II: Consistent application of the Pachner moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common choice for the evolution of the knotted graphs in loop quantum gravity is to use the Pachner moves, adapted to graphs from their dual triangulations. Here, we show that the natural way to consistently use these moves is on framed graphs with edge twists, where the Pachner moves can only be performed when the twists, and the vertices the edges are incident on, meet certain criteria. For other twists, one can introduce an algebraic object, which allow any knotted graph with framed edges to be written in terms of a generalized braid group.</description>

      <title>Static boson stars in the Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin theory and their astrophysical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static boson star solutions in the so-called Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (E-FLS) theory, performing a complete analysis of the solution space in this model. We study the phenomenological aspects of E-FLS stars, for instance, by investigating the timelike and null geodesics with an emphasis on the analysis of circular timelike orbits and light rings. In order to study the astrophysical signatures of such stars, their images were obtained considering them surrounded by a geometrically thin accretion disk. Our results comprise two different models of accretion disks, namely the optically thin and thick disk models. We present a selection of our findings for the astrophysical images of E-FLS stars and discuss their relevance as a possible black hole mimicker.</description>

      <title>On the role of closed timelike curves and confinement structure around Kerr-Newman singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the particle motion around the naked singularity and black hole of Kerr-Newman spacetime is investigated with a special attention on the closed timelike orbits. It is found that both in the naked singularity (NS) and in black hole (BH), the singularity is concealed by causality violating regions, and the Cauchy surface consistently resides inside the inner horizon in non-extremal black holes. For neutral particles and particles with an identical charge to the source, only particles with positive angular momentum are permitted to traverse the closed timelike curves. Conversely, for particles with the opposite charge to the source, the strong Coulomb attraction draws all particles inside the Cauchy surface, allowing them to be present in the closed timelike curves irrespective of their angular momentum. However, in both the NS and BH (both extremal and non-extremal), test particles are confined at a considerable distance from the singular point such that there always exists an empty region surrounding the singularity which prevents particles from interacting with it. The radius of the empty surface that depends on the source parameters and the particle characteristics, is investigated with an accurate expression.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave data analysis with high-precision numerical relativity simulations of boson star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave signals detected to date are commonly interpreted under the paradigm that they originate from pairs of black holes or neutron stars. Here, we explore the alternative scenario of boson-star signals being present in the data stream. We perform accurate and long ($\sim 20$ orbits) numerical simulations of boson-star binaries and inject the resulting strain into LIGO noise. Our Bayesian inference reveals that some boson-star signals. are degenerate with current approximants, albeit with biased parameters, while others exhibit smoking-gun signatures leaving behind conspicuous residuals.</description>

      <title>Frames and Slicings for Angular Momentum in Post-Minkowski Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic physics, angular momentum is paired with a lesser known conserved quantity, the "mass moment", which appears as the time-space components of the angular momentum tensor. Calculations of mass moment in electromagnetic and gravitational scattering of point particles have led to some puzzling behavior in which the radiated mass moment does not appear to match the corresponding mechanical change. We review the issues and show how the freedoms of time slicing and asymptotic frame may be used to bring all known results into agreement. The key points are to use hyperboloidal time slices and to allow the perturbative and asymptotic frames to differ by an independent Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) transformation at early and late times. The relevant BMS transformation involves a translation found recently by Riva, Vernizzi, and Wong. Building on this work, we conjecture a flux balance law for all orders in the post-Minkowski expansion.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Durgapal-Fuloria Neutron Stars in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathrm{T}^{2})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to obtain physically stable stellar models coupled with anisotropic matter distribution in the context of $f(\mathcal{R},\mathrm{T}^{2})$ theory. For this, we consider a static spherical geometry and formulate modified field equations containing various unknowns such as matter determinants and metric potentials. We then obtain a unique solution to these equations by employing Durgapal-Fuloria ansatz possessing a constant doublet. We also use matching criteria to calculate the values of these constants by considering the Schwarzschild exterior spacetime. Two different viable models of this modified theory are adopted to analyze the behavior of effective matter variables, anisotropy, energy conditions, compactness and redshift in the interiors of Her X-1, PSR J0348-0432, LMC X-4, SMC X-1, Cen X-3, and SAX J 1808.4-3658 star candidates. We also check the stability of these models by using three different physical tests. It is concluded that our considered stars satisfy all the physical requirements and are stable in this modified gravity for the considered parametric values.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating anisotropic fluids. I: Context and overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a sequence of three devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity. In this first paper we set the stage, place our work in the context of a vast literature on anisotropic stars in general relativity, and provide an overview of the results obtained in the remaining two papers. In both cases, Newtonian and relativistic, the state of the fluid is described by the familiar variables of an isotropic fluid (such as mass density and velocity field), to which we adjoin a director vector, which defines a locally preferred direction within the fluid. Both the Newtonian and relativistic theories are defined in terms of an action functional. While each theory is formulated in complete generality, in these papers we apply them to the construction of stellar models by restricting the fluid configurations to be static and spherically symmetric. We find that the equations of anisotropic stellar structure are generically singular at the stellar surface. To avoid a singularity, we postulate the existence of a phase transition at a critical value of the mass density; the fluid is anisotropic at high densities, and goes to an isotropic phase at low densities. In the case of Newtonian stars, we find that sequences of equilibrium configurations terminate at a maximum value of the central density; beyond this maximum the density profile becomes multi-valued within the star, and the model therefore becomes unphysical. In the case of relativistic stars, this phenomenon typically occurs beyond the point at which the stellar mass achieves a maximum. Also in the case of relativistic stars, we find that for a given equation of state and a given assignment of central density, anisotropic stellar models are always less compact than isotropic models.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating anisotropic fluid. II: Newtonian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a sequence of three devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in both Newtonian gravity and general relativity. In this second paper we develop the Newtonian theory, inspired by a real-life example of an anisotropic fluid, the (nematic) liquid crystal. We apply the theory to the construction of static and spherical stellar models. In addition to the usual fluid variables (mass density, velocity field), the Newtonian theory features a director vector field, whose length provides a local measure of the size of the anisotropy, and whose direction gives the local direction of anisotropy. The theory is defined in terms of a Lagrangian which implicates all the relevant forms of energy: kinetic energy (with contributions from the velocity field and the time derivative of the director vector), internal energy (with isotropic and anisotropic contributions), gravitational interaction energy, and gravitational-field energy. This Lagrangian is easy to motivate, and it provides an excellent starting point for a relativistic generalization in the third paper. The equations of motion for the fluid, and Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential, follow from a variation of the action functional, given by the time integral of the Lagrangian. Because our stellar models feature a transition from an anisotropic phase at high density to an isotropic phase at low density, a substantial part of the paper is devoted to the development of a mechanics for the interface fluid, which mediates the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating anisotropic fluid. III: Relativistic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third and final entry in a sequence of papers devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in Newtonian gravity and general relativity. In this third paper we elevate the Newtonian theory of the second paper to general relativity, and apply it to the construction of relativistic stellar models. The relativistic theory is crafted by promoting the fluid variables to a curved spacetime, and promoting the gravitational potential to the spacetime metric. The Newtonian action is then generalized in a direct and natural way, and dynamical equations for all the relevant variables are once more obtained through a variational principle. We specialize our relativistic theory of a self-gravitating anisotropic fluid to static and spherically symmetric configurations, and thus obtain models of anisotropic stars in general relativity. As in the Newtonian setting, the models feature a transition from an anisotropic phase at high density to an isotropic phase at low density. Our survey of stellar models reveals that for the same equations of state and the same central density, anisotropic stars are always less compact than isotropic stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased interest in pushing the frontier of gravitational wave searches to higher frequencies (kHz and beyond) has resulted in a variety of different proposed experimental concepts. A significant fraction of them are based on the coupling between classical electromagnetism and gravity. We highlight some differences and similarities between different approaches, showcasing the rich phenomenology arising from this coupling. We use the opportunity to re-derive the response function of interferometers as the low-frequency limit of a broader picture. This article was prepared as proceedings for Moriond Cosmology 2024.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in a Polymer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the presence of an area gap, different than zero, affects the gravitational collapse of a dust ball. The implementation of such discreteness is achieved through the framework of polymer quantization, a scheme inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG). We study the collapse using variables which represent the area, in order to impose the non-zero area gap condition. The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical Oppenheimer-Snyder models. In both scenarios the formation of the singularity is avoided, due to the inversion of the velocity at finite values of the sphere surface. This happens due to the presence of a negative pressure, with origins at a quantum level. When the inversion happens inside the black hole event horizon, we achieve a geometry transition to a white hole. When the inversion happens outside the event horizon, we find a new possible astrophysical object. A characterization of such hypothetical object is done. Some constraints on the value for the area gap are also imposed in order to maintain the link with our already established physical theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear differential equations are derived that describe the time evolution of the test particle coordinates during finite motions in the gravitational field of oscillating dark matter. It is shown that in the weak field approximation, the radial oscillations of a test particle and oscillations in orbital motion are described by the Hill equation and the nonhomogeneous Hill equation, respectively. In the case of scalar dark matter with a logarithmic self-interactions, these equations are integrated numerically, and the solutions are compared with the corresponding solutions of the original nonlinear system to identify possible resonance effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for noncommutative geometry-inspired Schwarzschild black holes, encompassing both non-extreme and extreme cases. By employing a spectral method, we calculate the QNMs in the context of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our findings not only challenge previous claims in the literature regarding the instability of these black holes but also reveal remarkable stability for both non-extreme and extreme Schwarzschild black holes under various perturbations.</description>

      <title>Orbits of particles with magnetic dipole moment around magnetized Schwarzschild black holes: Applications to S2 star orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from inspiralling compact binaries to N$^3$LO in the Effective Field Theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework to gravitational dynamics, we compute the Hamiltonian, source quadrupole moment, and gravitational-wave energy flux for (non-spinning) inspiralling compact binaries at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) in the Post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We use the recently developed $d$-dimensional multipole-expanded effective theory, and explicitly perform the matching to the (pseudo-) stress-energy tensor. The calculation involves Feynman integrals up to three- (conservative) and two-loop (radiative) orders, evaluated within dimensional regularization. Our (ambiguity-free) results confirm (for the first time) the value of the gravitational-wave flux for quasi-circular orbits at 3PN order, while paving the way forward to the inclusion of spin effects as well as higher order computations.</description>

      <title>Projective and Carrollian geometry at time/space-like infinity on projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss how to construct canonical \emph{strong} Carrollian geometries at time/space like infinity of projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds $(M,g)$ and discuss the links between the underlying projective structure of the metric $g$. The obtained Carrollian geometries are determined by the data of the projective compactification. The key idea to achieve this is to consider a new type of Cartan geometry based on a non-effective homogeneous model for projective geometry. We prove that this structure is a general feature of projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Negative lambda gravitational effective field theories dual to holographic CFTs have potentially realistic cosmological solutions. Generic cosmological solutions of these effective field theories have scalar field evolution that can lead to a period of accelerated expansion when the scalar field is at positive values of its potential (Fig. 1). If such a model describes our universe, significant evolution of dark energy is expected over a Hubble time as the scalar descends from positive to negative values of its potential towards the AdS extremum. Our recent observational study 2305.04946 based on supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations suggests that significant evolution of dark energy associated with a descending scalar field may be preferred by data (Fig. 2). Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential around the present value, a standard likelihood analysis gives an $e^{- \chi^2/2}$ distribution in which $dV/dt$ is presently negative in $99.99 \%$ of the distribution, with a mean fractional variation of the potential of $36 \%$ over the period $z \lessapprox 2$ over which supernova data is available. In this note, we review these theoretical and observational results and provide an update on the question of how the physics of these cosmological solutions can be related to the physics of the underlying CFT.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger &amp; Field and Finn &amp; Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.</description>

      <title>Dark magnetohydrodynamics: Black hole accretion in superradiant dark photon clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes threaded by massive vector fields can be subject to a superradiant instability, growing a cloud of massive vector particles around it. In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.</description>

      <title>Holographic image features of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic image of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity. The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system assists observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that show an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifted, the bright ring gradually transformed into a luminous arc and eventually transitioned into a light point. Simultaneously, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantity on the ring, and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that as the temperature $T$ and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter $q$ increase, the ring radius also increases, while an increase in the chemical potential $u$ leads to a decrease. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of $T$, $u$, and $q$ increase, albeit to varying degrees. Upon comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, it can be observed that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon sphere.</description>

      <title>Matter coupled to 3d Quantum Gravity: One-loop Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expect quantum field theories for matter to acquire intricate corrections due to their coupling to quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field. This can be precisely worked out in 3d quantum gravity: after integrating out quantum gravity, matter fields are effectively described as noncommutative quantum field theories, with quantum-deformed Lorentz symmetries. An open question remains: Are such theories unitary or not? On the one hand, since these are effective field theories obtained after integrating out high energy degrees of freedom, we may expect the loss of unitarity. On the other hand, as rigorously defined field theories built with Lorentz symmetries and standing on their own, we naturally expect the conservation of unitarity. In an effort to settle this issue, we explicitly check unitarity for a scalar field at one-loop level in both Euclidean and Lorentzian space-time signatures. We find that unitarity requires adding an extra-term to the propagator of the noncommutative theory, corresponding to a massless mode and given by a representation with vanishing Plancherel measure, thus usually ignored in spinfoam path integrals for quantum gravity. This indicates that the inclusion of matter in spinfoam models, and more generally in quantum gravity, might be more subtle than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing from Gravity as Universal Dephasing Channel for Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of a transmon qubit with a classical gravitational field. Exploiting the generic phenomena of the gravitational redshift and Aharonov-Bohm phase, we show that entangled quantum states dephase with a universal rate. The gravitational phase shift is expressed in terms of a quantum computing noise channel. We give a measurement protocol based on a modified phase estimation algorithm which is linear in the phase drift, which is optimal for measuring the small phase that is acquired from the gravitation channel. Additionally, we propose qubit-based platforms as quantum sensors for precision gravitometers and mechanical strain gauges as an example of this phenomenon's utility. We estimate a sensitivity for measuring the local gravitational acceleration to be $\delta g/g \sim 10^{-7}$. This paper demonstrates that classical gravitation has a non-trivial influence on quantum computing hardware, and provides an illustration of how quantum computing hardware may be utilized for purposes other than computation. While we focus on superconducting qubits, we point the universal nature of gravitational phase effects for all quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>A field-level emulator for modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stage IV dark energy surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid present a unique opportunity to shed light on the nature of dark energy. However, the full constraining power of the new data cannot be unlocked unless accurate predictions are available at all observable scales. Currently, only the linear regime is well understood in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: on the nonlinear scales, expensive numerical simulations become necessary, making their direct use impractical in the analyses of large datasets. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown potential to break this impasse: by training emulators, we can reproduce complex data fields in a fraction of the time it takes to produce them.
  In this work, we present a field-level emulator capable of turning a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation into one evolved under $f(R)$ gravity. To achieve this, we build on the map2map neural network, using the strength of modified gravity $|f_{R_0}|$ as style parameter. We find that our emulator correctly estimates the changes it needs to apply to the positions and velocities of the input N-body particles to produce the target simulation.
  We test the performance of our network against several summary statistics, finding $1\%$ agreement in the power spectrum up to $k \sim 1$ $h/$Mpc, and $1.5\%$ agreement against the independent boost emulator eMantis. Although the algorithm is trained on fixed cosmological parameters, we find it can extrapolate to models it was not trained on. Coupled with available field-level emulators and simulations suites for $\Lambda$CDM, our algorithm can be used to constrain modified gravity in the large-scale structure using full information available at the field-level.</description>

Abstract: Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. It is interesting to see whether current data can allow the existence of a negative CC not. In this paper, we perform the MCMC analysis for the $w_0w_a$CDM+CC model using recent DESI BAO measurements combined with Planck CMB and Pantheon Plus dataset. The results reveal that the bestfit energy density of CC is $\Omega_\Lambda\sim -0.3$ and the fitting to DESI is slightly improved, while $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ is also $1\sigma$ consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) in the anti-de Sitter space (AdS$_{2+0}$) that we model on a subset of hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p&gt;4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be applied to study low-energy quantum states on AdS.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the old problem of the self-force on a particle moving in a weak-field spacetime in the context of renewed interest in two-body gravitational scattering. We analytically calculate the scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational self-force on a particle moving on a straight-line trajectory at a large distance from a Newtonian star, and use these results to find the associated correction to its motion. In the gravitational case we must also include the matter-mediated force, which acts at the same perturbative order as the gravitational self-force. We further augment the gravitational results with geodesic calculations at second order in the central body mass to determine the full, explicit solution to the two-body gravitational scattering problem at second post-Minkowskian order (2PM). We calculate the momentum transfer (which reproduces Westpfahl's old result), the change in mechanical angular momentum (which matches the radiative flux recently computed by Damour), and the change in mechanical mass moment (the time-space components of the angular momentum tensor), which has not previously appeared. Besides the new 2PM results of explicit trajectories and all conserved quantities, this work clarifies the role of gravitational self-force in PM scattering theory and provides a foundation for higher-order calculations.</description>

Abstract: Recent work on scattering of massive bodies in general relativity has revealed that the mechanical center of mass of the system (or, more precisely, its relativistic mass moment) undergoes a shift during the scattering process. We show that the same phenomenon occurs in classical scattering of charged particles in flat spacetime and study the effect in detail. Working to leading order in the interaction, we derive formulas for the initial and final values of the mechanical and electromagnetic energy, momentum, angular momentum, and mass moment. We demonstrate that the change in mechanical mass moment is balanced by an opposite change in the mass moment stored in the electromagnetic field. This is a non-radiative exchange between particles and field, analogous to exchange of kinetic and potential energy. A simple mechanical analogy is a person scooting forward on the floor, who exchanges mass moment with the floor. We therefore say that electromagnetic scattering results in an electromagnetic scoot.</description>

Abstract: Recent interferometric observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the horizon-scale emission from sources in the vicinity of nearby supermassive black holes. Future space-based interferometers promise to measure the "photon ring"--a narrow, ring-shaped, lensed feature predicted by general relativity, but not yet observed--and thereby open a new window into strong gravity. Here we present AART: an Adaptive Analytical Ray-Tracing code that exploits the integrability of light propagation in the Kerr spacetime to rapidly compute high-resolution simulated black hole images, together with the corresponding radio visibility accessible on very long space-ground baselines. The code samples images on a nonuniform adaptive grid that is specially tailored to the lensing behavior of the Kerr geometry and is therefore particularly well-suited to studying photon rings. This numerical approach guarantees that interferometric signatures are correctly computed on long baselines, and the modularity of the code allows for detailed studies of equatorial sources with complex emission profiles and time variability. To demonstrate its capabilities, we use AART to simulate a black hole movie of a stochastic, non-stationary, non-axisymmetric equatorial source; by time-averaging the visibility amplitude of each snapshot, we are able to extract the projected diameter of the photon ring and recover the shape predicted by general relativity.</description>

      <title>The ring-shaped shadow of rotating naked singularity with a complete photon sphere</title>

Abstract: We investigate the shadows of Konoplya-Zhidenko naked singularity. In the spacetime of Konoplya-Zhidenko naked singularity, not only can unstable retrograde light ring (LR) exist, but also unstable prograde LR, leading to the formation of a complete photon sphere (PS). Due to the absence of an event horizon, a dark disc-shaped shadow does not appear; instead, a ring-shaped shadow is observed. The ring-shaped shadow appears as an infinite number of relativistic Einstein rings in the image of the naked singularity. For some parameter values, only the unstable retrograde LR exists, resulting in an incomplete unstable PS and consequently giving rise to the arc-shaped shadow for Konoplya-Zhidenko naked singularity. The shadow of Konoplya-Zhidenko naked singularity gradually shifts to the right as the rotation parameter $a$ increases, and gradually becomes smaller as the deformation parameter $|\eta|$ increases. Moreover, the stable LRs and stable photon spherical orbits can also exist in Konoplya-Zhidenko naked singularity spacetime, but they have no effect on the image of the naked singularity. This study demonstrates that rotating naked singularity can exhibit not only an arc-shaped shadow but also a ring-shaped shadow.</description>

Abstract: Spin network technique is usually generalized to relativistic case by changing $SO(4)$ group -- Euclidean counterpart of the Lorentz group -- to its universal spin covering $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, or by using the representations of $SO(3,1)$ Lorentz group. We extend this approach by using inhomogeneous Lorentz group $\mathcal{P}=SO(3,1)\rtimes \mathbb{R}^4$, which results in the simplification of the spin network technique. The labels on the network graph corresponding to the subgroup of translations $\mathbb{R}^4$ make the intertwiners into the products of $SU(2)$ parts and the energy-momentum conservation delta functions. This maps relativistic spin networks to usual Feynman diagrams for the matter fields.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can produce copies of gravitational-wave signals from the same source with the same waveform morphologies but different amplitudes and arrival times. Some of these strongly-lensed gravitational-wave signals can be demagnified and become sub-threshold. We present TESLA-X, an enhanced approach to the original GstLAL-based TargetEd Subthreshold Lensing seArch (TESLA) method, for improving the detection efficiency of these potential sub-threshold lensed signals. TESLA-X utilizes lensed injections to generate a targeted population model and a targeted template bank. We compare the performance of a full template bank search, TESLA, and TESLA-X methods via a simulation campaign, and demonstrate the performance of TESLA-X in recovering lensed injections, particularly targeting a mock event. Our results show that the TESLA-X method achieves a maximum of $\sim 10\%$ higher search sensitivity compared to the TESLA method within the sub-threshold regime, presenting a step towards detecting the first lensed gravitational wave. TESLA-X will be employed for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's collaboration-wide analysis to search for lensing signatures in the fourth observing run.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of 10^-4 by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the energy conditions for the recently proposed $f(R,L,T)$ gravity theory, for which $f$ is a generic function of the Ricci scalar $R$, matter lagrangian density $L$ and trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We analyse two different forms for the $f(R,L,T)$ function within the framework of the Friedmann-Lem\^aitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We constrain the model parameters from the energy conditions. This approach allows us to assess the feasibility of specific forms of the $f(R,L,T)$ gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes, the de Sitter modes as well as the near extremal modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on the families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin supplementary condition for the electromagnetic interactions which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follows from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>

      <title>Exploring modified Kaniadakis entropy: MOND theory and the Bekenstein bound conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the potential of Kaniadakis entropy to describe black hole entropy, proposing a modified version accounting for black hole thermodynamics. Additionally, we discuss the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory, a modification of Newton's second law aimed at explaining galaxy rotation curves without resorting to dark matter. Furthermore, we consider the Bekenstein bound conjecture which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems. We analyze this conjecture in the context of a modified Kaniadakis entropy and find that it holds for typical values of $\kappa$, as evidenced by our numerical investigation. Our exploration underscores the potential of a modified Kaniadakis statistics in understanding diverse physical phenomena, from gravitational systems to quantum mechanics, offering a promising direction for future research at the intersection of statistical mechanics and other important areas of physics as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by a thin shell of Bell particles located at the region just underneath the horizon. We argue that the configuration can be stabilized by a new kind of degeneracy pressure which is suggested by a noncommutative geometry in the interior of the black hole. Black hole singularity is avoided. We utilize the work of Parikh and Wilczek \cite{Parikh:1999mf} to include the effect of tunneling on the Bell particles. We show that partially tunneled Bell particles give the Page curve of Hawking radiation, and the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation. In view of entropic force, the location of these Bell states is naturally related to the island and the quantum extremal surface.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the early universe's equation of state and primordial black hole production with PTA, BBN, and CMB observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

      <title>Probing hadron-quark phase transition in twin stars using $f$-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is conjectured that a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in the ultrahigh-density environment of Neutron Stars (NS), the nature of phase transition remains an unresolved mystery. Furthermore, recent efforts reveal that the finite surface tension effects can lead to a mixed phase with different geometric shapes (so-called "pasta" phases), leading to a smooth phase transition from hadronic to quark matter in the NS interior. Depending on whether there is a strong or a pasta-induced smooth first-order phase transition, one may expect a third family of stable, compact stars or "twin stars" to appear, with the same mass but different radii compared to NSs. The possibility of identifying twin stars using astrophysical observations has been a subject of interest. This study investigates the potential of probing the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition through future gravitational wave (GW) detections from fundamental ($f$-) mode oscillations in Neutron Stars. Using a newly developed model that parametrizes the hadron-quark phase transition with ``pasta phases," we calculate $f$-mode characteristics within a full general relativistic framework. We then use Universal Relations in GW asteroseismology to derive stellar properties from the detected mode parameters. Our findings suggest that detecting GWs from $f$-modes with third-generation GW detectors offers a promising scenario for the existence of twin stars. However, we also estimate various uncertainties in determining the mode parameters and conclude that these uncertainties make it more challenging to identify the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the adiabatic tidal contributions to the radiation reacted momentum impulse $\Delta p_i^\mu$ and scattering angle $\theta$ between two scattered massive bodies (neutron stars) at next-to-next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order. The state-of-the-art three-loop (4PM) worldline quantum field theory toolkit using dimensional regularization is employed to establish the classical observables. We encounter divergent terms in the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic quadrupolar sectors necessitating the addition of post-adiabatic counterterms in this classical theory. This leads us to include also the leading post-adiabatic tidal contributions to the observables. The resulting renormalization group flow of the associated post-adiabatic Love numbers is established and shown to agree with a recent gravito-electric third post-Newtonian analysis in the non-relativistic limit.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $T\bar{T}$ deformation on non-Hermitian coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the holographic picture. The relationship between ground state and thermofield double state is preserved under the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We prove that $T\bar{T}$ deformed theory provides a reparameterization in large $N$ limit. These deformation effects is calculated numerically with green functions and free energy. The thermodynamic phase structures show the equivalence of the wormhole-black hole picture between non-Hermitian model and Hermitian model still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We also study the correlation function in Lorentz time and revival dynamic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. For higher dimensional situations, we show that the geometry of the brane satisfies Einstein's equation coupled with conformal matter. We comment on possible implications to the general rule of gravitational path integral from this equation.</description>

      <title>Massive twistor worldline in electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17056</link>

Abstract: We study the (ambi-)twistor model for spinning particles interacting via electromagnetic field, as a toy model for studying classical dynamics of gravitating bodies including effects of both spins to all orders. We compute the momentum kick and spin kick up to one-loop order and show precisely how they are encoded in the classical eikonal. The all-orders-in-spin effects are encoded as a dynamical implementation of the Newman-Janis shift, and we find that the expansion in both spins can be resummed to simple expressions in special kinematic configurations, at least up to one-loop order. We confirm that the classical eikonal can be understood as the generator of canonical transformations that map the in-states of a scattering process to the out-states. We also remark that cut contributions for converting worldline propagators from time-symmetric to retarded amount to the iterated action of the leading eikonal at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>A clock is just a way to tell the time: gravitational algebras in cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02116</link>

Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in semiclassical quantum gravity for cosmological backgrounds, focusing on two key examples: slow-roll inflation and evaporating Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial algebra of diffeomorphism-invariant observables \emph{without} the introduction of an external clock system or the presence of any asymptotic gravitational charges. Instead, the rolling inflaton field and the evaporating black hole act as physical clocks that allow a definition of gauge-invariant observables at $G = 0$. The resulting algebras are both Type II$_\infty$ factors, but neither is manifestly a crossed product algebra. We establish a connection between the Type II entropy of these algebras and generalized entropies for appropriate states. Our work extends previous results on Type II gravitational algebras and highlights the crucial role of out-of-equilibrium dynamics for defining gauge-invariant observables in semiclassical canonically quantised gravity. We also briefly discuss the construction of gauge-invariant algebras for compact wedges bounded by extremal surfaces in generic spacetimes (i.e. in the absence of any Killing symmetry). In contrast to the inflaton and black hole cases, this algebra does end up being a simple crossed product. No clock or asymptotic charges are required because of the absence of any symmetry in the classical background.</description>
