      <title>How Hamilton-Jacobi formalism helps to address the physical meaning of the wave function in Bohmian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meaning of the wave function has been a subject of intense debate in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian Mechanics, the prevailing view is the nomological interpretation, which regards the wave function as a nomological entity. To make this abstract notion more concrete, the wave function is often compared to the classical Hamiltonian - another high-dimensional field whose gradient determines particle motion. However, unlike the wave function, the Hamiltonian is not the solution to a differential equation. Furthermore, while the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism offers a pilot-wave formulation of classical mechanics, it has been largely overlooked in contemporary discussions about the physical meaning of the wave function. Nonetheless, in the classical limit, there is a clear mathematical connection between the quantum wave function and the guiding field in this formalism, specifically the action function S. On the basis of these mathematical parallels, we initially intended to argue that the action function is a more appropriate classical analogue of the wave function, which, when combined with a clear conceptual distinction between laws of nature and nomological entities, could strengthen the nomological interpretation. We thought it could address some of the criticisms levelled at the nomological interpretation without resorting to the speculative realm of quantum gravity. However, contrary to our initial expectations, a closer comparison of the roles played by the action function and the wave function in their respective formalisms suggests a departure from the nomological interpretation in favour of the so-called sui generis interpretation of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Decoherence, Branching, and the Born Rule in a Mixed-State Everettian Multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Everettian quantum mechanics, justifications for the Born rule appeal to self-locating uncertainty or decision theory. Such justifications have focused exclusively on a pure-state Everettian multiverse, represented by a wave function. Recent works in quantum foundations suggest that it is viable to consider a mixed-state Everettian multiverse, represented by a (mixed-state) density matrix. Here, we develop the conceptual foundations for decoherence and branching in a mixed-state multiverse, and extend arguments for the Born rule to this setting. This extended framework provides a unification of 'classical' and 'quantum' probabilities, and additional theoretical benefits, for the Everettian picture.</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle for measure-theoretic probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of relating the mathematics of probability theory to the empirical world of experiments has been debated for centuries. One of the oldest solutions proposed for this problem is a principle that states that an event with probability close to 1 nearly certainly occurs in a single trial of an experiment. This principle is now called $\textit{Cournot' principle}$.
  Cournot's principle was first formulated in the context of classical probability, in which the probability of any event is given, and the $\textit{product rule}$, i.e., the rule that the probability that two events occur in two separated trials is the product of their probabilities, can be deduced. On the contrary, in the modern measure-theoretic approach to probability, probability measures and experiments are separate entities that must be related in an appropriate way, and the product rule cannot be deduced.
  In this paper, a version of Cournot's principle suitable for measure-theoretic probability is proposed. Therefore, the principle is reformulated as a criterion for relating probability measures and experiments, and the product rule is explicitly stated.
  In spite of the vagueness of the notions involved, the new version is formulated in a rigorous manner and an exact result, namely, that at most one probability measure can be related to an experiment, is rigorously proven.</description>
