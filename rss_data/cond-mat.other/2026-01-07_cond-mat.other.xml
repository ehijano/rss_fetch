      <title>Restoring Bloch's Theorem for Cavity Exciton Polaron-Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-informed representation for hybrid photon--exciton--phonon quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians to restore Bloch's theorem. The interchange of momenta between fermions and bosons breaks crystalline excitons' translational symmetry under strong coupling. Restoring said symmetry, we efficiently compute experimentally accessible observables without introducing approximations to the Hamiltonian, enabling investigations that elucidate material properties in strong coupling with applications enhancing coherent transport and unlocking symmetry-forbidden matter transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical Nucleation Pathways in Liquid Condensation Revealed by Simulation and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using state-of-the-art rare-event sampling simulations, we precisely characterize the nucleation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated Lennard-Jones gas and uncover a key physical feature: critical clusters nucleate with a density that differs substantially from that of the macroscopic equilibrium liquid. Our atomistic simulations also reveal a nonclassical nucleation pathway showing simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic interactions in Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and the formation of skyrmion phases in centrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive X-ray and neutron scattering study of the structure and magnetic excitations of Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$, a sister compound of Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ which was recently found to host a skyrmion lattice phase despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modeled to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, specifically Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$, is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of the interactions between these quasiparticles is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to important exchange processes that can take place between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work, we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal in position space and depends on the combined spin configurations of the electrons and holes. When particularized to the case of hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, this potential becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to the case of arbitrary masses. We also show how including corrections due to excited states into the theory results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Our approach is also applicable to more complicated systems with nonhydrogenic exciton series, such as layered semiconductors with Rytova-Keldysh interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a dilute gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in this approach the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in...</description>

      <title>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>
