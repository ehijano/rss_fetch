      <title>Magnetic field-free braiding and nontrivial fusion of Majorana bound states in high-temperature planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for long-sought-after decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The ability to move the MBS on a two-dimensional platform such as a planar Josephson junction is practically constrained by a fixed direction of applied magnetic field. In addition, the detrimental effects of the magnetic field on proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures is an outstanding problem for the realization of topological superconductivity. Here we show that these problems can be solved in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which generates the MBS without the need of any external magnetic field, phase biasing, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using a high-temperature superconductor having $d$-wave pairing symmetry, we confirm that our planar junction can support the MBS at high temperatures. We propose protocols for performing non-trivial fusion, exchange and non-Abelian braiding of multiple MBS in our field-free platforms. The proposed geometries and MBS movement protocols open a path towards successful experimental detection of the MBS via confirmation of their non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <title>Intra-unit-cell singlet pairing mediated by altermagnetic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting instabilities induced by altermagnetic fluctuations. Because of the non-trivial sublattice structure of the altermagnetic order, shorter-range and longer-range fluctuations favor qualitatively different types of pairing states. Specifically, while the latter stabilize a standard spin-triplet $p$-wave state, just like ferromagnetic fluctuations, the former leads to intra-unit-cell pairing, in which the Cooper pairs are formed by electrons from different sublattices. The symmetry of the intra-unit-cell gap function can be not only $p$-wave, but also spin-singlet $s$-wave and $d$-wave, depending on the shape of the Fermi surface. We also show that coexistence with altermagnetic order promotes intrinsic non-trivial topology, such as protected Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces and higher-order topological superconductivity. Our work establishes the key role played by sublattice degrees of freedom in altermagnetic-fluctuation mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Orbital-Selective Photodoping Melts Charge Order in Overdoped Bi-based Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains one of the enduring puzzles of condensed matter physics, with charge order (CO) playing a central yet elusive role, particularly in the overdoped regime. Here, we employ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to probe the transient electronic density of states and ultrafast CO dynamics in overdoped (Bi,Pb)$_{2.12}$Sr$_{1.88}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram. Additionally, melting overdoped CO requires an order-of-magnitude higher fluence highlighting the role of lattice interactions. Our findings demonstrate orbital-selective photodoping and provide a route to ultrafast control of emergent quantum phases in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice Mismatch Driven In Plane Strain Engineering for Enhanced Upper Critical Fields in Mo2N Superconducting Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal nitrides are a fascinating class of hard coating material that provide an excellent platform for investigating superconductivity and fundamental electron phonon interactions. In this work the structural morphological and superconducting properties have been studied for Mo2N thin films deposited via direct current magnetron sputtering on cplane Al2O3 and MgO substrates to elucidate the effect of internal strain on superconducting properties. High resolution X Ray diffraction and time of flight elastic recoil detection analysis confirms the growth of single phase Mo2N thin films exhibiting epitaxial growth with twin domain structure. Low temperature electrical transport measurements reveal superconducting transitions at 5.2 K and 5.6 K with corresponding upper critical fields of 5 T and 7 T for the films deposited on Al2O3 and MgO, respectively. These results indicate strong type II superconductivity and the observed differences in superconducting properties are attributed to substrate induced strain which leads to higher e ph coupling for the film on MgO substrate. These findings highlight the tunability of superconducting properties in Mo2N films through strategic substrate selection.</description>

      <title>Impact of border defects on the magnetic flux penetration in superconducting films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in superconducting systems are ubiquitous and nearly unavoidable. They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, or voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the otherwise laminar flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent $n$, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e. ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities. Assessing the impact of surface and border defects is of utmost importance for all superconducting technologies, including superconducting resonators, superconducting single-photon detectors, superconducting radio-frequency cavities and accelerators, superconducting cables, superconducting metamaterials, superconducting diodes, and many others.</description>

      <title>Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.</description>

      <title>AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <title>High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$ plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component, non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory of $2\times2$ pair density waves in kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is an intriguing quantum matter proposed in the frontier of condensed matter physics. However, the existence of PDW in microscopic models has been rare. In this work, we obtain, by Ginzburg-Landau arguments and self-consistent mean field theory, novel $2a_0\times2a_0$ PDW on the kagome lattice arising from attractive on-bond pairing interactions and the distinct Bloch wave functions near the p-type van Hove singularity. The PDW state carrying three independent wave-vectors, the so-called 3Q PDW, is nodeless and falls into two topological classes characterized by the Chern number $C = 0$ or $C = \pm2$. The chiral ($C=\pm2$) PDW state presents a rare case of interaction driven topological quantum state without the requirement of spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we analyze the stabilities and properties of these PDWs intertwining with charge orders, and discuss the relevance of our minimal model to recent experimental observations in kagome superconductors. Our theory not only elucidates the driving force of the chiral PDW, but also predicts strongly anisotropic superconducting gap structure in the momentum space and quantized transverse thermal conductivity that can be tested in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the properties of flat-band superconductor junctions that behave differently from ordinary junctions containing only metals with Fermi surfaces. In particular, we show how in the tunneling limit the critical Josephson current between flat-band superconductors is inversely proportional to the pair potential, how the quantum geometric contribution to the supercurrent contributes even in the normal state of a flat-band weak link, and how Andreev reflection is strongly affected by the presence of bound states. Our results are relevant for analyzing the superconducting properties of junctions involving electronic systems with flat bands.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of gapless and gapped vortex modes with Majorana corner states in a 2D second-order topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the appearance of vortex-localized states with zero energy in first-order topological superconductors is well known, their possibility to form in the higher-order topological phase of 2D systems has not been completely uncovered yet. Here we demonstrate the coexistence of zero-energy vortex modes and Majorana corner modes in the model of a 2D second-order topological superconductor. The model describes an interface between a normal layer supporting the topological insulating phase and a superconducting layer, for which different symmetries of the spin-singlet superconducting order parameter are considered. We show that the gapless vortex modes can appear under certain conditions in the superconducting state with a vortex if the bulk energy spectrum of the normal (non-superconducting) state is gapless and has Dirac cones. The number of pairs of such vortex modes corresponds to the number of Dirac cones. It is essential that if the normal bulk spectrum becomes gapped and the system is in the state of a topological insulator, then the zero-energy vortex modes can not be realized, while Majorana corner modes hold in the superconducting state. The interaction of the vortex modes with the edge and topological corner modes is studied when the vortex appears near the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Deeper insight into the terahertz response of conventional superconductors under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. First, we review theoretical approaches describing the fundamental processes of suppression of superconductivity in magnetic field and how the in-gap states are filled. In the Voigt geometry, thin superconducting films are fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. In this configuration, we provide an alternative description of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee ${\it et\,al.}$ [Nat. Commun. 14,2737 (2023)], which better fits their data for magnetic fields above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we measured and analyzed the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. In both geometries, the optical conductivity can be comprehensively described by the model of Herman and Hlubina [Phys. Rev. B 96, 014509 (2017)] involving pair-conserving, and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films</title>

Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</description>

      <title>Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Something about the Mechanism of Induction Phenomena: The forgotten work of Berta de Haas-Lorentz on diamagnetism in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1925, Dr. Geertruida Luberta "Berta" de Haas-Lorentz published the paper "Iets over het mechanisme van inductieverschijnselen" in the journal Physica. Her paper was the first to discuss perfect diamagnetism of superconductors, eight years before the discovery of the Meissner effect, when the essential difference between the two phenomena was not understood. Unfortunately, her work was almost forgotten by the scientific community. To counter this, we translate her seminal 1925 paper from Dutch into English. We provide an overview of the life of Dr. De Haas-Lorentz, and comment on her pioneering contribution to the theory of superconductivity.</description>
