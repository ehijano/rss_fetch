      <title>Analysis of Propaganda in Tweets From Politically Biased Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News outlets are well known to have political associations, and many national outlets cultivate political biases to cater to different audiences. Journalists working for these news outlets have a big impact on the stories they cover. In this work, we present a methodology to analyze the role of journalists, affiliated with popular news outlets, in propagating their bias using some form of propaganda-like language. We introduce JMBX(Journalist Media Bias on X), a systematically collected and annotated dataset of 1874 tweets from Twitter (now known as X). These tweets are authored by popular journalists from 10 news outlets whose political biases range from extreme left to extreme right. We extract several insights from the data and conclude that journalists who are affiliated with outlets with extreme biases are more likely to use propaganda-like language in their writings compared to those who are affiliated with outlets with mild political leans. We compare eight different Large Language Models (LLM) by OpenAI and Google. We find that LLMs generally performs better when detecting propaganda in social media and news article compared to BERT-based model which is fine-tuned for propaganda detection. While the performance improvements of using large language models (LLMs) are significant, they come at a notable monetary and environmental cost. This study provides an analysis of both the financial costs, based on token usage, and the environmental impact, utilizing tools that estimate carbon emissions associated with LLM operations.</description>

      <title>Addressing overlapping communities in multiple-source detection: An edge clustering approach for complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source detection problem in network analysis involves identifying the origins of diffusion processes, such as disease outbreaks or misinformation propagation. Traditional methods often focus on single sources, whereas real-world scenarios frequently involve multiple sources, complicating detection efforts. This study addresses the multiple-source detection (MSD) problem by integrating edge clustering algorithms into the community-based label propagation framework, effectively handling mixed-membership issues where nodes belong to multiple communities.
  The proposed approach applies the automated latent space edge clustering model to a network, partitioning infected networks into edge-based clusters to identify multiple sources. Simulation studies on ADD HEALTH social network datasets demonstrate that this method achieves superior accuracy, as measured by the F1-Measure, compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. The results highlight the robustness of edge clustering in accurately detecting sources, particularly in networks with complex and overlapping source regions. This work advances the applicability of clustering-based methods to MSD problems, offering improved accuracy and adaptability for real-world network analyses.</description>

      <title>Uncovering High-Order Cohesive Structures: Efficient (k,g)-Core Computation and Decomposition for Large Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, increasingly utilised to model complex and diverse relationships in modern networks, have gained significant attention for representing intricate higher-order interactions. Among various challenges, cohesive subgraph discovery is one of the fundamental problems and offers deep insights into these structures, yet the task of selecting appropriate parameters is an open question. To address this question, we aim to design an efficient indexing structure to retrieve cohesive subgraphs in an online manner. The main idea is to enable the discovery of corresponding structures within a reasonable time without the need for exhaustive graph traversals. Our method enables faster and more effective retrieval of cohesive structures, which supports decision-making in applications that require online analysis of large-scale hypergraphs. Through extensive experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed indexing technique.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Evolutionary Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of communities - whether biological, social, economic, technological or ecological depends on the balance between cooperation and cheating. While cooperation strengthens communities, selfish individuals, or "cheaters," exploit collective benefits without contributing. If cheaters become too prevalent, they can trigger the collapse of cooperation and of the community, often in an abrupt manner. A key challenge is determining whether the risk of such a collapse can be detected in advance. To address this, we use a combination of evolutionary graph theory and machine learning to examine how one can predict the unravel of cooperation on complex networks. By introducing few cheaters into a structured population, we employ machine learning to detect and anticipate the spreading of cheaters and cooperation collapse. Using temporal and structural data, the presented results show that prediction accuracy improves with stronger selection strength and larger observation windows, with CNN-Seq-LSTM and Seq-LSTM best performing models. Moreover, the accuracy for the predictions depends crucially on the type of game played between cooperators and cheaters (i.e., accuracy improves when it is more advantageous to defect) and on the community structure. Overall, this work introduces a machine learning approach into detecting abrupt shifts in evolutionary graph theory and offer potential strategies for anticipating and preventing cooperation collapse in complex social networks.</description>

      <title>AI Feedback Enhances Community-Based Content Moderation through Engagement with Counterarguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, social media platforms are significant sources of news and political communication, but their role in spreading misinformation has raised significant concerns. In response, these platforms have implemented various content moderation strategies. One such method, Community Notes on X, relies on crowdsourced fact-checking and has gained traction, though it faces challenges such as partisan bias and delays in verification. This study explores an AI-assisted hybrid moderation framework in which participants receive AI-generated feedback -supportive, neutral, or argumentative -on their notes and are asked to revise them accordingly. The results show that incorporating feedback improves the quality of notes, with the most substantial gains resulting from argumentative feedback. This underscores the value of diverse perspectives and direct engagement in human-AI collective intelligence. The research contributes to ongoing discussions about AI's role in political content moderation, highlighting the potential of generative AI and the importance of informed design.</description>

      <title>Temporal Motifs for Financial Networks: A Study on Mercari, JPMC, and Venmo Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of financial transactions among people is critical for various applications such as fraud detection. One important aspect of financial transaction networks is temporality. The order and repetition of transactions can offer new insights when considered within the graph structure. Temporal motifs, defined as a set of nodes that interact with each other in a short time period, are a promising tool in this context. In this work, we study three unique temporal financial networks: transactions in Mercari, an online marketplace, payments in a synthetic network generated by J.P. Morgan Chase, and payments and friendships among Venmo users. We consider the fraud detection problem on the Mercari and J.P. Morgan Chase networks, for which the ground truth is available. We show that temporal motifs offer superior performance to several baselines, including a previous method that considers simple graph features and two node embedding techniques (LINE and node2vec), while being practical in terms of runtime performance. For the Venmo network, we investigate the interplay between financial and social relations on three tasks: friendship prediction, vendor identification, and analysis of temporal cycles. For friendship prediction, temporal motifs yield better results than general heuristics, such as Jaccard and Adamic-Adar measures. We are also able to identify vendors with high accuracy and observe interesting patterns in rare motifs, such as temporal cycles. We believe that the analysis, datasets, and lessons from this work will be beneficial for future research on financial transaction networks.</description>

      <title>Signed Diverse Multiplex Networks: Clustering and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Signed Generalized Random Dot Product Graph (SGRDPG) model, which is a variant of the Generalized Random Dot Product Graph (GRDPG), where, in addition, edges can be positive or negative. The setting is extended to a multiplex version, where all layers have the same collection of nodes and follow the SGRDPG. The only common feature of the layers of the network is that they can be partitioned into groups with common subspace structures, while otherwise matrices of connection probabilities can be all different. The setting above is extremely flexible and includes a variety of existing multiplex network models, including GRDPG, as its particular cases.
  By employing novel methodologies, our paper ensures strongly consistent clustering of layers and highly accurate subspace estimation, which are significant improvements over the results of Pensky and Wang (2024). All algorithms and theoretical results in the paper remain true for both signed and binary networks. In addition, the paper shows that keeping signs of the edges in the process of network construction leads to a better precision of estimation and clustering and, hence, is beneficial for tackling real world problems such as, for example, analysis of brain networks.</description>

      <title>Incivility and Contentiousness Spillover in Public Engagement with Public Health and Climate Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affective polarization and political sorting drive public antagonism around issues at the science-policy nexus. Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and public health on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. The observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings show how affective polarization in public engagement with science becomes entrenched across science policy domains.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Probabilistic Propagation in Graphs by Adding Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic graphs are an abstraction that allow us to study randomized propagation in graphs. In a probabilistic graph, each edge is "active" with a certain probability, independent of the other edges. For two vertices $u,v$, a classic quantity of interest, that we refer to as the proximity $\mathcal{P}_{G}(u, v)$, is the probability that there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ all of whose edges are active. For a given subset of vertices $V_s$, the reach of $V_s$ is defined as the minimum over pairs $u \in V_s$ and $v \in V$ of the proximity $\mathcal{P}_{G}(u,v)$. This quantity has been studied in the context of multicast in unreliable communication networks and in social network analysis.
  We study the problem of improving the reach in a probabilistic graph via edge augmentation. Formally, given a budget $k$ of edge additions and a set of source vertices $V_s$, the goal of Reach Improvement is to maximize the reach of $V_s$ by adding at most $k$ new edges to the graph. The problem was introduced in earlier empirical work in the algorithmic fairness community. We provide the first approximation guarantees and hardness results for Reach Improvement.
  We prove that the existence of a good augmentation implies a cluster structure for the graph. We use this structural result to analyze a novel algorithm that outputs a $k$-edge augmentation with an objective value that is poly($\beta^*$), where $\beta^*$ is the objective value for the optimal augmentation. We also give an algorithm that adds $O(k \log n)$ edges and yields a multiplicative approximation to $\beta^*$. Our arguments rely on new probabilistic tools for analyzing proximity, inspired by techniques in percolation theory; these tools may be of broader interest. Finally, we show that significantly better approximations are unlikely, under known hardness assumptions related to gap variants of the classic Set Cover problem.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>
