      <title>On injective partial Catalan monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $[n]$ be a finite chain $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, and let $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$ be the semigroup consisting of all isotone and order-decreasing injective partial transformations on $[n]$. In addition, let $\mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n} = \{\alpha \in \mathcal{IC}_{n} : \, 1\not \in \text{Dom } \alpha\}$ be the subsemigroup of $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$, consisting of all transformations in $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$, each of whose domains does not contain $1$. For $1 \leq p \leq n$, let $K(n,p) = \{\alpha \in \mathcal{IC}_{n} : \, |\text{Im }\, \alpha| \leq p\}$ and $M(n,p) = \{\alpha \in \mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n} : \, |\text{Im } \, \alpha| \leq p\}$ be the two-sided ideals of $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$ and $\mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n}$, respectively. Moreover, let ${RIC}_{p}(n)$ and ${RQ}^{\prime}_{p}(n)$ denote the Rees quotients of $K(n,p)$ and $M(n,p)$, respectively. It is shown in this article that for any \( S \in \{ \mathcal{RIC}_{p}(n), K(n,p) \} \), \( S \) is abundant; \( \mathcal{IC}_{n} \) is ample; and for any \( S \in \{ \mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n}, \mathcal{RQ}^{\prime}_{p}(n), M(n,p) \} \), \( S \) is right abundant for all values of \( n \), but not left abundant for \( n \geq 2 \). Furthermore, the ranks of the Rees quotients ${RIC}_{p}(n)$ and ${RQ}^{\prime}_{p}(n)$ are shown to be equal to the ranks of the two-sided ideals $K(n,p)$ and $M(n,p)$, respectively. These ranks are found to be $\binom{n}{p}+(n-1)\binom{n-2}{p-1}$ and $\binom{n}{p}+(n-2)\binom{n-3}{p-1}$, respectively. In addition, the ranks of the semigroups $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$ and $\mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n}$ were found to be $2n$ and $n^{2}-3n+4$, respectively. Finally, we characterize all the maximal subsemigroups of $\mathcal{IC}_{n}$ and $\mathcal{Q}^{\prime}_{n}$.</description>

      <title>A family of level-transitive groups with positive fixed-point proportion and positive Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a method to calculate the fixed-point proportion of any iterated wreath product acting on a $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the method applies to a generalization of iterated wreath products acting on a $d$-regular tree, which are not groups. As an application of this generalization, a family of groups of finite type of depth $2$ acting on a $d$-regular tree with $d \geq 3$ and $d \neq 2 \pmod{4}$ is constructed. These groups are self-similar, level-transitive, have positive Hausdorff dimension, and exhibit a positive fixed-point proportion. Unlike other groups with a positive fixed-point proportion known in the literature, the fixed-point proportion of this new family can be calculated explicitly. Furthermore, the iterated Galois group of the polynomial $x^d + 1$ with $d \geq 2$ appears in this family, so its fixed-point proportion is calculated.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Finite Semigroups: History and Decidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers, Margolis, Rhodes and Schilling proved that the complexity of a finite semigroup is computable. This solved a problem that had been open for more than 50 years. The purpose of this paper is to survey the basic results of Krohn-Rhodes complexity of finite semigroups and to outline the proof of its computability.</description>

      <title>Locally compact piecewise full groups of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when a piecewise full group (a.k.a. topological full group) of homeomorphisms of the Cantor space $X$ can be given a non-discrete totally disconnected locally compact (t.d.l.c.) topology and give a criterion for the alternating full group (in the sense of Nekrashevych's group A(G) to be compactly generated. As a result, starting from qualitative criteria, we obtain a large class of t.d.l.c. groups such that the derived group is non-discrete, compactly generated, open and simple, putting previous constructions of Neretin, Roever and Lederle in a more systematic context. We also show some notable properties of Neretin's groups apply to this class in general. General consequences are derived for the theory of simple t.d.l.c. groups, prime among them the universal role that alternating full groups play in the class of simple t.d.l.c. groups that are non-discrete, compactly generated and locally decomposable.
  Some of the theory is developed in the setting of topological inverse monoids of partial homeomorphisms of $X$. In particular, we obtain a sufficient condition to extend the topology to a monoid equipped with all restrictions with respect to compact open subsets of $X$ and all joins of compatible pairs of elements. The compact generation criterion is also naturally expressed in this context.</description>

      <title>Abstract Regular Polytopes of Finite Irreducible Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, for $W$ the Coxeter group $\mathrm{D}_n$ where $n &gt; 4$, it is proved that the maximal rank of an abstract regular polytope for $W$ is $n - 1$ if $n$ is even and $n$ if $n$ is odd. Further it is shown that $W$ has abstract regular polytopes of rank $r$ for all $r$ such that $3 \leq r \leq n - 1$, if $n$ is even, and $3 \leq r \leq n$, if $n$ is odd. The possible ranks of abstract regular polytopes for the exceptional finite irreducible Coxeter groups are also determined.</description>

      <title>Groups with a covering condition on commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a group G and positive integers k,n, we let B_n=B_n(G) denote the set of all elements x in G such that |x^G|\leq n, and we say that G satisfies the (k,n)-covering condition for commutators if there is a subset S in G such that |S|\leq k and all commutators of G are contained in the product SB_n. The importance of groups satisfying this condition was revealed in the recent study of probabilistically nilpotent finite groups of class two. The main result obtained in this paper is the following theorem.
  Let G be a group satisfying the (k,n)-covering condition for commutators. Then G' contains a characteristic subgroup B such that [G':B] and |B'| are both (k,n)-bounded.
  This extends several earlier results of similar flavour.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Lyons Conjecture II: Undecidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, and its companion [BCLV24], are devoted to a negative resolution of the Aldous--Lyons Conjecture [AL07, Ald07].
  In this part we study tailored non-local games. This is a subclass of non-local games -- combinatorial objects which model certain experiments in quantum mechanics, as well as interactive proofs in complexity theory. Our main result is that, given a tailored non-local game $G$, it is undecidable to distinguish between the case where $G$ has a special kind of perfect strategy, and the case where every strategy for $G$ is far from being perfect. Using a reduction introduced in the companion paper [BCLV24], this undecidability result implies a negative answer to the Aldous--Lyons conjecture. Namely, it implies the existence of unimodular networks that are non-sofic.
  To prove our result, we use a variant of the compression technique developed in MIP*=RE [JNV+21]. Our main technical contribution is to adapt this technique to the class of tailored non-local games. The main difficulty is in establishing answer reduction, which requires a very careful adaptation of existing techniques in the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs. As a byproduct, we are reproving the negation of Connes' embedding problem [Con76] -- i.e., the existence of a $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor which cannot be embedded in an ultrapower of the hyperfinite $\mathrm{II}_1$-factor -- first proved in [JNV+21], using an arguably more streamlined proof. In particular, we incorporate recent simplifications from the literature [dlS22b, Vid22] due to de la Salle and the third author.</description>

      <title>Disproof of claims about pure cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let L=Q(n^1/3) be a pure cubic field with normal closure k=Q(n^1/3,zeta), where n&gt;1 denotes a cube free integer, and zeta is a primitive cube root of unity. Suppose k possesses an elementary bicyclic 3-class group Cl_3(k), and the conductor of k/Q(zeta) has the shape f in { pq_1q_2,3pq,9pq } where p congruent 1(mod 9) and q,q_1,q_2 congruent 2,5(mod 9) are primes. It is disproved that there are only two possible capitulation types kappa(k), either type a.1, (0000), or type a.2, (1000), as claimed by Ismaili and El Mesaoudi. Evidence is provided, theoretically and experimentally, of two further types, b.10, (0320), and d.23, (1320).</description>

Abstract: For a non-compact finite thickness building whose Davis apartment is an orientable pseudomanifold, we compute the supremum of the set of $p&gt;1$ such that its top dimensional reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology is nonzero. We adapt the non-vanishing assertion of this result to any finite thickness building using the Bestvina realization. Using similar techniques, we generalize bounds obtained by Clais on the conformal dimension of some Gromov-hyperbolic buildings to any such building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract. This article determines relations between two notions concerning monoids: factorability structure, introduced to simplify the bar complex; and quadratic normalisation, introduced to generalise quadratic rewriting systems and normalisations arising from Garside families. Factorable monoids are characterised in the axiomatic setting of quadratic normalisations. Additionally, quadratic normalisations of class (4,3) are characterised in terms of factorability structures and a condition ensuring the termination of the associated rewriting system.</description>

      <title>Linear representations, crystallographic quotients, and twisted conjugacy of virtual Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Artin groups were recently introduced by Bellingeri, Paris, and Thiel as broad generalizations of the well-known virtual braid groups. For each Coxeter graph $\Gamma$, they defined the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$, which is generated by the corresponding Artin group $A[\Gamma]$ and the Coxeter group $W[\Gamma]$, subject to certain mixed relations inspired by the action of $W[\Gamma]$ on its root system $\Phi[\Gamma]$. There is a natural surjection $ \mathrm{VA}[\Gamma] \rightarrow W[\Gamma]$, with the kernel $PVA[\Gamma]$ representing the pure virtual Artin group. In this paper, we explore linear representations and crystallographic quotients of virtual Artin groups. Inspired from the work of Cohen, Wales, and Krammer, we construct a linear representation of the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$. As a consequence of this representation, we deduce that if $W[\Gamma]$ is a spherical Coxeter group, then $VA[\Gamma]/PVA[\Gamma]'$ is a crystallographic group of dimension $ |\Phi[\Gamma]|$ with the holonomy group $W[\Gamma]$. We also investigate twisted conjugacy in these groups, and prove that each right-angled virtual Artin group admit the $R_\infty$-property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.14116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a closed and orientable surface of genus at least 2, we prove the surface group extensions of the stabilizers of multicurves are hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This answers a question of Durham, Dowdall, Leininger, and Sisto. We also include an appendix that employs work of Charney, Cordes, and Sisto to characterize the Morse boundaries of hierarchically hyperbolic groups whose largest acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space is on a quasi-tree.</description>
