      <title>SDP Synthesis of Distributionally Robust Backward Reachable Trees for Probabilistic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents Maximal Ellipsoid Backward Reachable Trees MAXELLIPSOID BRT, which is a multi-query algorithm for planning of dynamic systems under stochastic motion uncertainty and constraints on the control input. In contrast to existing probabilistic planning methods that grow a roadmap of distributions, our proposed method introduces a framework to construct a roadmap of ambiguity sets of distributions such that each edge in our proposed roadmap provides a feasible control sequence for a family of distributions at once leading to efficient multi-query planning. Specifically, we construct a backward reachable tree of maximal size ambiguity sets and the corresponding distributionally robust edge controllers. Experiments show that the computation of these sets of distributions, in a backwards fashion from the goal, leads to efficient planning at a fraction of the size of the roadmap required for state-of-the-art methods. The computation of these maximal ambiguity sets and edges is carried out via a convex semidefinite relaxation to a novel nonlinear program. We also formally prove a theorem on maximum coverage for a technique proposed in our prior work.</description>

      <title>An Optimization Algorithm for Customer Topological Paths Identification in Electrical Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A customer topological path represents the sequence of network elements connecting an MV/LV transformer to a customer. Accurate knowledge of these paths is crucial for distribution system operators (DSOs) in digitalization, analysis, and network planning. This paper introduces an innovative approach to address the challenge of customer topological path identification (TPI) using only the limited and often inaccurate data available to DSOs. Specifically, our method relies only on geographic information system (GIS) data of network elements and the customer to MV/LV transformers connection information. We introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization algorithm designed to identify customer topological paths that closely approximate the real electricity paths. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its application to both an academic and a real-world electrical distribution network. Results show that the method effectively addresses data inaccuracies and successfully identifies customer topological paths, providing a valuable tool for DSOs in developing accurate digital twins of their distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Fair Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for PV Active Control in LV Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of distributed energy resources, particularly photovoltaic (PV) panels, has presented new and complex challenges for power network control. With the significant energy production from PV panels, voltage issues in the network have become a problem. Currently, PV smart inverters (SIs) are used to mitigate the voltage problems by controlling their active power generation and reactive power injection or absorption. However, reducing the active power output of PV panels can be perceived as unfair to some customers, discouraging future installations. To solve this issue, in this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is proposed to address voltage issues in a distribution network, while considering fairness in active power curtailment among customers. The feasibility of the proposed approach is explored through experiments, demonstrating its ability to effectively control voltage in a fair and efficient manner.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Procedure for Topological Path Identification with Raw Data Transformation in Electrical Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a systematic approach to address the topological path identification (TPI) problem in power distribution networks. Our approach starts by listing the DSO's raw information coming from several sources. The raw information undergoes a transformation process using a set of transformation functions. This process converts the raw information into well-defined information exploitable by an algorithm. Then a set of hypothetical paths is generated, considering any potential connections between the elements of the power distribution system. This set of hypothetical paths is processed by the algorithm that identifies the hypothetical paths that are compatible with the well-defined information. This procedure operates iteratively, adapting the set of transformation functions based on the result obtained: if the identified paths fail to meet the DSO's expectations, new data is collected, and/or the transformation functions found to be responsible for the discrepancies are modified. The systematic procedure offers practical advantages for DSOs, including improved accuracy in path identification and high adaptability to diverse network configurations, even with incomplete or inaccurate data. Consequently, it emerges as a useful tool for the construction of digital twins of power distribution networks that aligns with DSO expectations.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Cooler Model for Cement Clinker Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 2D model for a grate belt cooler in the pyro-section of a cement plant. The model is formulated as an index-1 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model based on first engineering principles. The model systematically integrates thermo-physical aspects, transport phenomena, reaction kinetics, mass and energy balances, and algebraic volume and energy relations. The model is used for dynamic simulation of the cooler and the paper provides dynamic and steady-state simulation results matching the expected behavior. The cooler model is one part of a full pyro-section model for dynamical simulations. The model can serve as a basis for the design of optimization and control systems towards improving energy efficiency and CO2 emission.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Vehicle Dynamics Using Gradient-Based, Mixed-Fidelity Multidisciplinary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In automotive engineering, designing for optimal vehicle dynamics is challenging due to the complexities involved in analysing the behaviour of a multibody system. Typically, a simplified set of dynamics equations for only the key bodies of the vehicle such as the chassis and wheels are formulated while reducing their degrees of freedom. In contrast, one could employ high-fidelity multibody dynamics simulation and include more intricate details such as the individual suspension components while considering full degrees of freedom for all bodies; however, this is more computationally demanding. Also, for gradient-based design optimization, computing adjoints for different objective functions can be more challenging for the latter approach, and often not feasible if an existing multibody dynamics solver is used.
  We propose a mixed-fidelity multidisciplinary approach, in which a simplified set of dynamics equations are used to model the whole vehicle while incorporating a high-fidelity multibody suspension module as an additional coupled discipline. We then employ MAUD (modular analysis and unified derivatives) to combine analytical derivatives based on the dynamics equations and finite differences obtained using an existing multibody solver. Also, we use a collocation method for time integration, which solves for both the system trajectory and optimal design variables simultaneously. The benefits of our approach are shown in an experiment conducted to find optimal vehicle parameters that optimize ride comfort and driving performance considering vertical vehicle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Virtual Test-bed of the Blown Powder Directed Energy Deposition Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins in manufacturing serve as a crucial bridge between the industrial age and the digital age, offering immense value. Current additive manufacturing processes are able to generate vast amounts of in-process data, which, when effectively ingested, can be transformed into insightful decisions. Data-driven methods from reduced order modeling and system identification are particularly promising in managing this data deluge. This study focuses on Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) equipped with in-situ process measurements to develop a compact virtual test-bed. This test-bed can accurately ingest arbitrary process inputs and report in-process observables as outputs. This virtual test-bed is derived using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and is coupled with uncertainty quantification techniques to ensure robust predictions.</description>

      <title>Response Surface Methodology coupled with desirability functions for multi-objective optimization: minimizing indoor overheating hours and maximizing useful daylight illuminance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and desirability functions were employed in a case study to optimize the thermal and daylight performance of a computational model of a tropical housing typology. Specifically, this approach simultaneously optimized Indoor Overheating Hours (IOH) and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) metrics through an Overall Desirability (D). The lack of significant association between IOH and other annual daylight metrics enabled a focused optimization of IOH and UDI. Each response required only 138 simulation runs (~30 hours for 276 runs) to determine the optimal values for passive strategies: window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and roof overhang depth across four orientations, totalling eight factors. First, initial screening based on $2_V^{8-2}$ fractional factorial design, identified four key factors using stepwise and Lasso regression, narrowed down to three: roof overhang depth on the south and west, WWR on the west, and WWR on the south. Then, RSM optimization yielded an optimal solution (roof overhang: 3.78 meters, west WWR: 3.76%, south WWR: 29.3%) with a D of 0.625 (IOH: 8.33%, UDI: 79.67%). Finally, robustness analysis with 1,000 bootstrap replications provided 95% confidence intervals for the optimal values. This study optimally balances thermal comfort and daylight with few experiments using a computationally-efficient multi-objective approach.</description>

      <title>Stability Margins of Neural Network Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to train neural network controllers with guaranteed stability margins. The method is applicable to linear time-invariant plants interconnected with uncertainties and nonlinearities that are described by integral quadratic constraints. The type of stability margin we consider is the disk margin. Our training method alternates between a training step to maximize reward and a stability margin-enforcing step. In the stability margin enforcing-step, we solve a semidefinite program to project the controller into the set of controllers for which we can certify the desired disk margin.</description>

      <title>Market Implications of Alternative Operating Reserve Modeling in Wholesale Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing and settlement mechanisms are crucial for efficient re-source allocation, investment incentives, market competition, and regulatory oversight. In the United States, Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) adopts a uniform pricing scheme that hinges on the marginal costs of supplying additional electricity. This study investigates the pricing and settlement impacts of alternative reserve constraint modeling, highlighting how even slight variations in the modeling of constraints can drastically alter market clearing prices, reserve quantities, and revenue outcomes. Focusing on the diverse market designs and assumptions in ancillary services by U.S. RTOs, particularly in relation to capacity sharing and reserve substitutions, the research examines four distinct models that combine these elements based on a large-scale synthetic power system test data. Our study provides a critical insight into the economic implications and the underlying factors of these alternative reserve constraints through market simulations and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Capability Augmentation for Heterogeneous Dynamic Teaming with Temporal Logic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers how heterogeneous multi-agent teams can leverage their different capabilities to mutually improve individual agent performance. We present Capability-Augmenting Tasks (CATs), which encode how agents can augment their capabilities based on interactions with other teammates. Our framework integrates CAT into the semantics of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), which defines individual spatio-temporal tasks for all agents. A centralized Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) is used to synthesize trajectories for all agents. We compare the expressivity of our approach to a baseline of Capability Temporal Logic Plus (CaTL+). Case studies demonstrate that our approach allows for simpler specifications and improves individual performance when agents leverage the capabilities of their teammates.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Regularized Continuous-Time System Identification from Sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of continuous-time (CT) systems from discrete-time (DT) input and output signals, i.e., the sampled data, has received considerable attention for half a century. The state-of-the-art methods are parametric methods and thus subject to the typical issues of parametric methods. In the last decade, a major advance in system identification is the so-called kernel-based regularization method (KRM), which is free of the issues of parametric methods. It is interesting to test the potential of KRM on CT system identification. However, very few results have been reported, mainly because the estimators have no closed forms for general CT input signals, except for some very special cases. In this paper, we show for KRM that the estimators have closed forms when the DT input signal has the typical intersample behavior, i.e., zero-order hold or band-limited, and this paves the way for the application of KRM for CT system identification. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed method is more robust than the state-of-the-art methods and more accurate when the sample size is small.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Roles against Assignment Based Policies in Two vs Two Target Defense Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a target defense game in which the attacker team seeks to reach a high-value target while the defender team seeks to prevent that by capturing them away from the target. To address the curse of dimensionality, a popular approach to solve such team-vs-team game is to decompose it into a set of one-vs-one games. Such an approximation assumes independence between teammates assigned to different one-vs-one games, ignoring the possibility of a richer set of cooperative behaviors, ultimately leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we provide teammate-aware strategies for the attacker team and show that they can outperform the assignment-based strategy, if the defenders still employ an assignment-based strategy. More specifically, the attacker strategy involves heterogeneous roles where one attacker actively intercepts a defender to help its teammate reach the target. We provide sufficient conditions under which such a strategy benefits the attackers, and we validate the results using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time Indirect Adaptive Control for Systems with State-Dependent Disturbances via Directional Forgetting: Concurrent Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive controller design for cases with disturbances is critical in practical applications for preventing unexpected control performance degradation and instability. Recently, adaptive control systems with relaxed persistent excitation (PE) conditions have been proposed to solve this problem; however, most discussions have focused on continuous-time systems. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive control method for discrete-time systems with disturbances that combines directional forgetting and concurrent learning. The proposed method does not require the PE condition, information on disturbances, unknown parameters, or matching conditions, and it guarantees exponential uniform ultimate unbounded (UUB). It was also theoretically demonstrated that the upper bound of the UUB can be designed based on the forgetting factor, which is a design parameter. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Inference and Learning in Partially Known Nonlinear State-Space Models by Learning Expressive Degrees of Freedom Offline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent real-world systems critically depend on expressive information about their system state and changing operation conditions, e.g., due to variation in temperature, location, wear, or aging. To provide this information, online inference and learning attempts to perform state estimation and (partial) system identification simultaneously. Current works combine tailored estimation schemes with flexible learning-based models but suffer from convergence problems and computational complexity due to many degrees of freedom in the inference problem (i.e., parameters to determine). To resolve these issues, we propose a procedure for data-driven offline conditioning of a highly flexible Gaussian Process (GP) formulation such that online learning is restricted to a subspace, spanned by expressive basis functions. Due to the simplicity of the transformed problem, a standard particle filter can be employed for Bayesian inference. In contrast to most existing works, the proposed method enables online learning of target functions that are nested nonlinearly inside a first-principles model. Moreover, we provide a theoretical quantification of the error, introduced by restricting learning to a subspace. A Monte-Carlo simulation study with a nonlinear battery model shows that the proposed approach enables rapid convergence with significantly fewer particles compared to a baseline and a state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the reachability problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. Our goal is to present a unified framework for calculating the probabilistic reachable set of discrete-time systems in the presence of both deterministic input and stochastic noise. By adopting a suitable separation strategy, the probabilistic reachable set is decoupled into a deterministic reachable set and the effect of the stochastic noise. To capture the effect of the stochastic noise, in particular sub-Gaussian noise, we provide a probabilistic bound on the distance between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is a novel energy function called the Averaged Moment Generating Function, which we leverage to provide a high probability bound on this distance. We show that this probabilistic bound is tight for a large class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems and is exact for linear stochastic dynamics. By combining this tight probabilistic bound with the existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we propose a flexible framework that can efficiently compute probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic systems. We also provide two case studies for applying our framework to Lipschitz bound reachability and interval-based reachability. Three numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distribution network reconfiguration for operational objectives: reducing voltage violation incidents and network losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the share of Distributed energy resources (DER) in the low voltage distribution network (DN) is expected to rise, a higher and more variable electric load and generation could stress the DNs, leading to increased congestion and power losses. To address these challenges, DSOs will have to invest in strengthening the network infrastructure in the coming decade. This paper looks to minimize the need for flexibility through dynamic DN reconfiguration. Typically, European DNs predominantly use manual switches. Hence, the network configuration is set for longer periods of time. Therefore, an opportunity is missed to benefit from more short-term dynamic switching. In this paper, a method is proposed which identifies the best manual switches to replace with remotely controlled switches based on their performance in terms of avoided voltage congestion incidents and DN power losses. The developed method is an exhaustive search algorithm which divides the problem into 3 subsequent parts, i.e. radial configuration identification, multi-period power flow and impact assessment for reconfigurable switch replacement on DN operation. A numerical evaluation shows that replacing the two top-ranked switches in the test case reduced the power losses by 4.51% and the voltage constraint violations by 38.17%. Thus, investing in only a few reconfigurable switches can substantially improve the operational efficiency of DNs.</description>

      <title>Improved Physics-Informed Neural Network based AC Power Flow for Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power flow analysis plays a critical role in the control and operation of power systems. The high computational burden of traditional solution methods led to a shift towards data-driven approaches, exploiting the availability of digital metering data. However, data-driven approaches, such as deep learning, have not yet won the trust of operators as they are agnostic to the underlying physical model and have poor performances in regimes with limited observability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new, physics-informed model. More specifically, a novel physics-informed loss function is developed that can be used to train (deep) neural networks aimed at power flow simulation. The loss function is not only based on the theoretical AC power flow equations that govern the problem but also incorporates real physical line losses, resulting in higher loss accuracy and increased learning potential. The proposed model is used to train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and is evaluated on a small 3-bus test case both against another physics-informed GNN that does not incorporate physical losses and against a model-free technique. The validation results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional physics-informed network on all used performance metrics. Even more interesting is that the model shows strong prediction capabilities when tested on scenarios outside the training sample set, something that is a substantial deficiency of model-free techniques.</description>

      <title>A Data-Informed Analysis of Scalable Supervision for Safety in Autonomous Vehicle Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly anticipated approach toward eliminating roadway fatalities. At the same time, the bar for safety is both high and costly to verify. This work considers the role of remotely-located human operators supervising a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for safety. Such a 'scalable supervision' concept was previously proposed to bridge the gap between still-maturing autonomy technology and the pressure to begin commercial offerings of autonomous driving. The present article proposes DISCES, a framework for Data-Informed Safety-Critical Event Simulation, to investigate the practicality of this concept from a dynamic network loading standpoint. With a focus on the safety-critical context of AVs merging into mixed-autonomy traffic, vehicular arrival processes at 1,097 highway merge points are modeled using microscopic traffic reconstruction with historical data from interstates across three California counties. Combined with a queuing theoretic model, these results characterize the dynamic supervision requirements and thereby scalability of the teleoperation approach. Across all scenarios we find reductions in operator requirements greater than 99% as compared to in-vehicle supervisors for the time period analyzed. The work also demonstrates two methods for reducing these empirical supervision requirements: (i) the use of cooperative connected AVs -- which are shown to produce an average 3.67 orders-of-magnitude system reliability improvement across the scenarios studied -- and (ii) aggregation across larger regions.</description>

      <title>Ensuring System-Level Protection against Eavesdropping Adversaries in Distributed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the objective of protecting the states of a distributed dynamical system from eavesdropping adversaries. We prove that state-of-the-art distributed algorithms, which rely on communicating the agents' states, are vulnerable in that the final states can be perfectly estimated by any adversary including those with arbitrarily small eavesdropping success probability. While existing literature typically adds an extra layer of protection, such as encryption or differential privacy techniques, we demonstrate the emergence of a fundamental protection quotient in distributed systems when innovation signals are communicated instead of the agents' states.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of Curvature Effect in Flexible Antenna Arrays for 2-Dimensional Beam Alignment of 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the influential role of flexible antenna array curvature on the performance of 6G communication systems with carrier frequencies above 100 GHz. It is demonstrated that the curvature of flexible antenna arrays can be leveraged for 2-dimensional beam alignment in phased arrays with relatively small insertion loss. The effect of antenna array bending on the radiation properties such as gain and antenna impedance are analytically studied and simulated for a 4x4 microstrip patch antenna array operating between 97.5-102.5 GHz. Moreover, the deployment of this flexible antenna array in conjunction with state-of-the-art flexible board packaging techniques is examined for 6G wireless transceivers based on 65nm CMOS technology and simulated for three variants of quadrature amplitude modulation (4QAM, 16 QAM, and 64 QAM). The communication performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) is evaluated using analytical derivations and simulation results which exhibit a relatively close match.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Optimal Control with Sparse Sensing and Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present novel convex optimization formulations for designing full-state and output-feedback controllers with sparse actuation that achieve user-specified $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance criteria. For output-feedback control, we extend these formulations to simultaneously design control laws with sparse actuation and sensing. The sparsity is induced through the minimization of a weighted $\ell_1$ norm, promoting the efficient use of sensors and actuators while maintaining desired closed-loop performance. The proposed methods are applied to a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, demonstrating the advantages of simultaneous optimization of the control law, sensing, and actuation architecture in realizing an efficient closed-loop system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backstepping Control of Linear and Nonlinear Systems (BaCLNS) is a Python package developed to automate the design, simulation, and analysis of backstepping control laws for both linear and nonlinear control-affine systems. By providing a standardized framework, BaCLNS simplifies the process of deriving backstepping controllers, making this powerful control technique more accessible to engineers, researchers, and educators. The package handles complex system dynamics, ensuring robust stabilization even in the presence of significant nonlinearities. BaCLNS's modular design allows users to define custom control systems, simulate their behavior , and visualize the results all within a user-friendly environment. The effectiveness of the package is demonstrated through a series of illustrative examples, ranging from simple linear systems to chaotic nonlinear systems, including the Vaidyanathan Jerk System, the pendulum and the Van der Pol Oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LASR Laboratory is investigating the use of free-flying spacecraft modules in several on-orbit, servicing and manufacturing (OSAM) activities. Previous work consists of the system development and testing of the aforementioned thrust-capable modules. This study makes advancements to devise, implement and validate an algorithm for the estimation of inertial parameters of a rigid structure, to be maneuvered with the help of Transforming Proximity Operations and Docking Service (TPODS) satellite modules. The primary contribution of this activity is observability analysis to infer a conducive input sequence for estimating the inertial parameters. For the experimental validation of proposed estimation algorithm, real-time pose measurements are logged through the VICON motion capture system and the recorded data is utilized to assess the performance of the estimation algorithm to predict mass and moment of inertia of an isolated TPODS module.</description>

Abstract: A robust pose estimation algorithm based on an extended Kalman filter using measurements from accelerometers, rate gyroscopes, monocular vision and ultra-wideband radar is presented. The sensor fusion and pose estimation algorithm incorporates Mahalonobis distance-based outlier rejection and under-weighting of measurements for robust filter performance in the case of sudden range measurements led by the absence of measurements due to range limitations of radar transceivers. The estimator is further validated through an experimental analysis using low-cost radar, IMU and camera sensors. The pose estimate is utilized to perform proximity operations and docking of Transforming Proximity Operations and Docking Service (TPODS) satellite modules with a fixed target.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making for autonomous driving incorporating different types of risks is a challenging topic. This paper proposes a novel risk metric to facilitate the driving task specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) by balancing the risk brought up by different uncertain events. Such a balance is achieved by discounting the costs of these uncertain events according to their timing and severity, thereby reflecting a human-like awareness of risk. We have established a connection between this risk metric and the occupation measure, a fundamental concept in stochastic reachability problems, such that a risk-aware control synthesis problem under LTL specifications is formulated for autonomous vehicles using occupation measures. As a result, the synthesized policy achieves balanced decisions across different types of risks with associated costs, showcasing advantageous versatility and generalizability. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</description>

Abstract: In response to escalating global drinking water scarcity we propose an innovative, automatic system for reusing clean sink water to flush toilets. Existing solutions for water recycle in the houses involve purifiers and complex treatments, leading to high costs and constant maintenance. WASD, utilizing sensors and a solenoid valve, rapidly detects and separates clean water, directing it to toilet tank while sending non-reusable water to the drain. This cost-effective and user-friendly approach aims to establish sustainable water practices in domestic settings, contributing to solve the shortage of drinking water.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Event-Triggered Systems: Safe Learning of Quasi-Optimal Deadline Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical architecture to improve the efficiency of event-triggered control (ETC) in reducing resource consumption. This paper considers event-triggered systems generally as an impulsive control system in which the objective is to minimize the number of impulses. Our architecture recognizes that traditional ETC is a greedy strategy towards optimizing average inter-event times and introduces the idea of a deadline policy for the optimization of long-term discounted inter-event times. A lower layer is designed employing event-triggered control to guarantee the satisfaction of control objectives, while a higher layer implements a deadline policy designed with reinforcement learning to improve the discounted inter-event time. We apply this scheme to the control of an orbiting spacecraft, showing superior performance in terms of actuation frequency reduction with respect to a standard (one-layer) ETC while maintaining safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Carryover Storage Quantification Framework for Mid-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-term planning of cascaded hydropower systems (CHSs) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources, i.e., maximizing the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the mid-term CHS planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a good balance between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a module to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed module; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into mid-term CHS planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHS operators. Finally, numerical results on a CHS of Portland General Electric demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in determining proper carryover storage values to facilitate mid-term CHS planning.</description>

      <title>Safe Control of Quadruped in Varying Dynamics via Safety Index Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Varying dynamics pose a fundamental difficulty when deploying safe control laws in the real world. Safety Index Synthesis (SIS) deeply relies on the system dynamics and once the dynamics change, the previously synthesized safety index becomes invalid. In this work, we show the real-time efficacy of Safety Index Adaptation (SIA) in varying dynamics. SIA enables real-time adaptation to the changing dynamics so that the adapted safe control law can still guarantee 1) forward invariance within a safe region and 2) finite time convergence to that safe region. This work employs SIA on a package-carrying quadruped robot, where the payload weight changes in real-time. SIA updates the safety index when the dynamics change, e.g., a change in payload weight, so that the quadruped can avoid obstacles while achieving its performance objectives. Numerical study provides theoretical guarantees for SIA and a series of hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SIA in real-world deployment in avoiding obstacles under varying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Characterization of Cross-Area and Intra-Area SSOs Sensitive to Delay in Droop Control of Grid-Forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) involving grid-forming converters (GFCs) are in a less familiar territory of power system dynamics. This letter reports a new phenomenon namely cross-area SSOs in grids with 100% droop-controlled GFC-based renewable penetration, which was discovered during our study on evaluating the adequacy of quasistationary phasor calculus (QPC) and space phasor calculus (SPC)-based models in capturing SSOs. We present frequency-domain characterization of such oscillatory modes in addition to intra-area SSOs in grids involving GFCs and study the impact of a delay in power-frequency droop feedback loop in regards to their stability. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Context-Conditioned Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning for Reliable V2V Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving reliable multidimensional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) channel state information (CSI) prediction is both challenging and crucial for optimizing downstream tasks that depend on instantaneous CSI. This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Compositional Design of Safety Controllers for Large-scale Stochastic Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a compositional scheme based on small-gain reasoning for the safety controller synthesis of interconnected stochastic hybrid systems with both continuous evolutions and instantaneous jumps. In our proposed setting, we first offer an augmented scheme to represent each stochastic hybrid subsystem with continuous and discrete evolutions in a unified framework, ensuring that the state trajectories match those of the original hybrid systems. We then introduce the concept of augmented control sub-barrier certificates (A-CSBC) for each subsystem, which allows the construction of augmented control barrier certificates (A-CBC) for interconnected systems and their safety controllers under small-gain compositional conditions. We eventually leverage the constructed A-CBC and quantify a guaranteed probabilistic bound across the safety of the interconnected system. While the computational complexity of designing a barrier certificate and its safety controller grows polynomially with network dimension using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, our compositional approach significantly reduces it to a linear scale with respect to the number of subsystems. We verify the efficacy of our proposed approach over an interconnected stochastic hybrid system composed of $1000$ nonlinear subsystems.</description>

      <title>From a Single Trajectory to Safety Controller Synthesis of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with developing a data-driven approach for learning control barrier certificates (CBCs) and associated safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems with unknown mathematical models, guaranteeing system safety over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>An integrated design of robust decentralized observer and controller for load frequency control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing completely decentralized load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems to achieve global optimized performance. To this end, a new concept of integrated design is introduced for designing the decentralized LFC observers and controllers simultaneously off-line, by taking into account of the interactions between areas and the bidirectional effects between the local observer and controller in each area. The integrated design in this paper is realized via $H_\infty$ optimization with a single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation. The LMI regional eigenvalue assignment technique is further incorporated with $H_\infty$ optimization to improve the closed-loop system transient performance. A three-area power system is simulated to validate the superiority of the proposed integrated design over the conventional decentralized designs.</description>

      <title>Safe and Stable Closed-Loop Learning for Neural-Network-Supported Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe learning of control policies remains challenging, both in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this article, we consider safe learning of parametrized predictive controllers that operate with incomplete information about the underlying process. To this end, we employ Bayesian optimization for learning the best parameters from closed-loop data. Our method focuses on the system's overall long-term performance in closed-loop while keeping it safe and stable. Specifically, we parametrize the stage cost function of an MPC using a feedforward neural network. This allows for a high degree of flexibility, enabling the system to achieve a better closed-loop performance with respect to a superordinate measure. However, this flexibility also necessitates safety measures, especially with respect to closed-loop stability. To this end, we explicitly incorporated stability information in the Bayesian-optimization-based learning procedure, thereby achieving rigorous probabilistic safety guarantees. The proposed approach is illustrated using a numeric example.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Learning of Stable Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models of dynamical systems characterized by specific stability properties is of crucial importance in applications. Existing results mainly focus on linear systems or some limited classes of nonlinear systems and stability notions, and the general problem is still open. This article proposes a kernel-based nonlinear identification procedure to directly and systematically learn stable nonlinear discrete-time systems. In particular, the proposed method can be used to enforce, on the learned model, bounded-input-bounded-state stability, asymptotic gain, and input-to-state stability properties, as well as their incremental counterparts. To this aim, we build on the reproducing kernel theory and the Representer Theorem, which are suitably enhanced to handle stability constraints in the kernel properties and in the hyperparameters' selection algorithm. Once the methodology is detailed, and sufficient conditions for stability are singled out, the article reviews some widely used kernels and their applicability within the proposed framework. Finally, numerical results validate the theoretical findings showing, in particular, that stability may have a beneficial impact in long-term simulation with minimal impact on prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed control algorithms are known to reduce overall computation time compared to centralized control algorithms. However, they can result in inconsistent solutions leading to the violation of safety-critical constraints. Inconsistent solutions can arise when two or more agents compute concurrently while making predictions on each others control actions. To address this issue, we propose an iterative algorithm called Synchronization-Based Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control, which we presented in [1]. The algorithm consists of two steps: 1. computing the optimal control inputs for each agent and 2. synchronizing the predicted states across all agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in the control of multiple small-scale vehicles in our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance, Flight Smoothness and Control Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard-to-model and highly stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet performance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system. While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to systematically address the trade-off between high authority control and performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a hybrid, model-based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We then utilize state-of-the-art results from Covariance Steering theory, which offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods</description>

      <title>Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control: Chance-Constraint Satisfaction with Identified Multi-step Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven stochastic model predictive control framework for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach leverages multi-step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we present a strategy to identify multi-step predictors and quantify the associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data-driven) state space model. Then, we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Energy Management for Recuperation Axles in Refrigerated Trailers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refrigerated truck trailers are currently mainly operated with environmentally harmful diesel units; an alternative is to operate the refrigeration unit with electrical energy. However, this requires a battery, the size of which can be reduced by using a recuperation axle, which recovers energy during braking. Current systems work purely reactively and often in so-called towing mode, in which a generator torque is provided without a braking request from the driver in order to secure the energy supply. However, this drag leads to additional consumption in the truck. This work quantifies the potential of predictive energy management that uses route and environmental data to minimize CO2 emissions. This was done using simulation data obtained with the help of VECTO. It was shown that there is still considerable potential for savings, so this paper provides an important basis for the later development of predictive energy management and, thus, for the electrification of refrigerated truck transports.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various information-processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling, decision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools, and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM adoption in future ADS frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15522v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By enabling constraint-aware online model adaptation, model predictive control using Gaussian process (GP) regression has exhibited impressive performance in real-world applications and received considerable attention in the learning-based control community. Yet, solving the resulting optimal control problem in real-time generally remains a major challenge, due to i) the increased number of augmented states in the optimization problem, as well as ii) computationally expensive evaluations of the posterior mean and covariance and their respective derivatives. To tackle these challenges, we employ i) a tailored Jacobian approximation in a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach, and combine it with ii) a parallelizable GP inference and automatic differentiation framework. Reducing the numerical complexity with respect to the state dimension $n_x$ for each SQP iteration from $\mathcal{O}(n_x^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3)$, and accelerating GP evaluations on a graphical processing unit, the proposed algorithm computes suboptimal, yet feasible solutions at drastically reduced computation times and exhibits favorable local convergence properties. Numerical experiments verify the scaling properties and investigate the runtime distribution across different parts of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic ODE Solvers for Integration Error-Aware Numerical Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17731v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Appropriate time discretization is crucial for real-time applications of numerical optimal control, such as nonlinear model predictive control. However, if the discretization error strongly depends on the applied control input, meeting accuracy and sampling time requirements simultaneously can be challenging using classical discretization methods. In particular, neither fixed-grid nor adaptive-grid discretizations may be suitable, when they suffer from large integration error or exceed the prescribed sampling time, respectively. In this work, we take a first step at closing this gap by utilizing probabilistic numerical integrators to approximate the solution of the initial value problem, as well as the computational uncertainty associated with it, inside the optimal control problem (OCP). By taking the viewpoint of probabilistic numerics and propagating the numerical uncertainty in the cost, the OCP is reformulated such that the optimal input reduces the computational uncertainty insofar as it is beneficial for the control objective. The proposed approach is illustrated using a numerical example, and potential benefits and limitations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards safe and tractable Gaussian process-based MPC: Efficient sampling within a sequential quadratic programming framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning uncertain dynamics models using Gaussian process~(GP) regression has been demonstrated to enable high-performance and safety-aware control strategies for challenging real-world applications. Yet, for computational tractability, most approaches for Gaussian process-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) are based on approximations of the reachable set that are either overly conservative or impede the controller's safety guarantees. To address these challenges, we propose a robust GP-MPC formulation that guarantees constraint satisfaction with high probability. For its tractable implementation, we propose a sampling-based GP-MPC approach that iteratively generates consistent dynamics samples from the GP within a sequential quadratic programming framework. We highlight the improved reachable set approximation compared to existing methods, as well as real-time feasible computation times, using two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Train-On-Request: An On-Device Continual Learning Workflow for Adaptive Real-World Brain Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are expanding beyond clinical settings thanks to advances in hardware and algorithms. However, they still face challenges in user-friendliness and signal variability. Classification models need periodic adaptation for real-life use, making an optimal re-training strategy essential to maximize user acceptance and maintain high performance. We propose TOR, a train-on-request workflow that enables user-specific model adaptation to novel conditions, addressing signal variability over time. Using continual learning, TOR preserves knowledge across sessions and mitigates inter-session variability. With TOR, users can refine, on demand, the model through on-device learning (ODL) to enhance accuracy adapting to changing conditions. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a motor-movement dataset recorded with a non-stigmatizing wearable BMI headband, achieving up to 92% accuracy and a re-calibration time as low as 1.6 minutes, a 46% reduction compared to a naive transfer learning workflow. We additionally demonstrate that TOR is suitable for ODL in extreme edge settings by deploying the training procedure on a RISC-V ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9), resulting in 21.6 ms of latency and 1 mJ of energy consumption per training step. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an online, energy-efficient, dynamic adaptation of a BMI model to the intrinsic variability of EEG signals in real-time settings.</description>

      <title>Throughput-Optimal Scheduling via Rate Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing scheduling policies for communication networks. This problem is often addressed with max-weight-type approaches since they are throughput-optimal. However, max-weight policies make scheduling decisions based on the network congestion, which can be sometimes unnecessarily restrictive. In this paper, we present a ``schedule as you learn'' (SYL) approach, where we learn an average rate, and then select schedules that generate such a rate in expectation. This approach is interesting because scheduling decisions do not depend on the size of the queue backlogs, and so it provides increased flexibility to select schedules based on other criteria or rules, such as serving high-priority queues. We illustrate the results with numerical experiments for a cross-bar switch and show that, compared to max-weight, SYL can achieve lower latency to certain flows without compromising throughput optimality.</description>

      <title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09263v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description>

      <title>TransformerMPC: Accelerating Model Predictive Control via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reducing the computational burden of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for real-time robotic applications. We propose TransformerMPC, a method that enhances the computational efficiency of MPC algorithms by leveraging the attention mechanism in transformers for both online constraint removal and better warm start initialization. Specifically, TransformerMPC accelerates the computation of optimal control inputs by selecting only the active constraints to be included in the MPC problem, while simultaneously providing a warm start to the optimization process. This approach ensures that the original constraints are satisfied at optimality. TransformerMPC is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any MPC solver, irrespective of its implementation. To guarantee constraint satisfaction after removing inactive constraints, we perform an offline verification to ensure that the optimal control inputs generated by the MPC solver meet all constraints. The effectiveness of TransformerMPC is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations on complex robotic systems, achieving up to 35x improvement in runtime without any loss in performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptable, shape-conforming robotic endoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a size-adaptable robotic endoscope design, which aims to improve the efficiency and comfort of colonoscopy. The robotic endoscope proposed in this paper combines the expansion mechanism and the external drive system, which can adjust the shape according to the different pipe diameters, thus improving the stability and propulsion force during propulsion. As an actuator in the expansion mechanism, flexible bellows can provide a normal force of 3.89 N and an axial deformation of nearly 10mm at the maximum pressure, with a 53% expansion rate in the size of expandable tip. In the test of the locomotion performance of the prototype, we obtained the relationship with the propelling of the prototype by changing the friction coefficient of the pipe and the motor angular velocity. In the experiment with artificial bowel tissues, the prototype can generate a propelling force of 2.83 N, and the maximum linear speed is 29.29 m/s in average, and could produce effective propulsion when it passes through different pipe sizes. The results show that the prototype can realize the ability of shape adaptation in order to obtain more propulsion. The relationship between propelling force and traction force, structural optimization and miniaturization still need further exploration.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Safe and Scalable Multi-Agent Control under Limited Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deploy safe and agile robots in cluttered environments, there is a need to develop fully decentralized controllers that guarantee safety, respect actuation limits, prevent deadlocks, and scale to thousands of agents. Current approaches fall short of meeting all these goals: optimization-based methods ensure safety but lack scalability, while learning-based methods scale but do not guarantee safety. We propose a novel algorithm to achieve safe and scalable control for multiple agents under limited actuation. Specifically, our approach includes: $(i)$ learning a decentralized neural Integral Control Barrier function (neural ICBF) for scalable, input-constrained control, $(ii)$ embedding a lightweight decentralized Model Predictive Control-based Integral Control Barrier Function (MPC-ICBF) into the neural network policy to ensure safety while maintaining scalability, and $(iii)$ introducing a novel method to minimize deadlocks based on gradient-based optimization techniques from machine learning to address local minima in deadlocks. Our numerical simulations show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent control algorithms in terms of safety, input constraint satisfaction, and minimizing deadlocks. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization across scenarios with varying agent counts, scaling up to 1000 agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed system design and component selection for the Transforming Proximity Operations and Docking Service (TPODS) module, designed to gain custody of uncontrolled resident space objects (RSOs) via rendezvous and proximity operation (RPO). In addition to serving as a free-flying robotic manipulator to work with cooperative and uncooperative RSOs, the TPODS modules are engineered to have the ability to cooperate with one another to build scaffolding for more complex satellite servicing activities. The structural design of the prototype module is inspired by Tensegrity principles, minimizing the structural mass of the modules frame. The prototype TPODS module is fabricated using lightweight polycarbonate with an aluminum or carbon fiber frame. The inner shell that houses various electronic and pneumatic components is 3-D printed using ABS material. Four OpenMV H7 R1 cameras are used for the pose estimation of resident space objects (RSOs), including other TPODS modules. Compressed air supplied by an external source is used for the initial testing and can be replaced by module-mounted nitrogen pressure vessels for full on-board propulsion later. A Teensy 4.1 single-board computer is used as a central command unit that receives data from the four OpenMV cameras, and commands its thrusters based on the control logic.</description>

      <title>Introducing DAIMYO: a first-time-right dynamic design architecture and its application to tail-sitter UAS development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable evolution in various multidisciplinary design methodologies for dynamic systems. Among these approaches, a noteworthy concept is that of concurrent conceptual and control design or co-design. This approach involves the tuning of feedforward and/or feedback control strategies in conjunction with the conceptual design of the dynamic system. The primary aim is to discover integrated solutions that surpass those attainable through a disjointed or decoupled approach. This concurrent design paradigm exhibits particular promise in the context of hybrid unmanned aerial systems (UASs), such as tail-sitters, where the objectives of versatility (driven by control considerations) and efficiency (influenced by conceptual design) often present conflicting demands. Nevertheless, a persistent challenge lies in the potential disparity between the theoretical models that underpin the design process and the real-world operational environment, the so-called reality gap. Such disparities can lead to suboptimal performance when the designed system is deployed in reality. To address this issue, this paper introduces DAIMYO, a novel design architecture that incorporates a high-fidelity environment, which emulates real-world conditions, into the procedure in pursuit of a `first-time-right' design. The outcome of this innovative approach is a design procedure that yields versatile and efficient UAS designs capable of withstanding the challenges posed by the reality gap.</description>

      <title>Mission Planning on Autonomous Avoidance for Spacecraft Confronting Orbital Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mission planning problem for spacecraft confronting orbital debris to achieve autonomous avoidance. Firstly, combined with the avoidance requirements, a closed-loop framework of autonomous avoidance for orbital debris is proposed. Under the established model of mission planning, a two-stage planning is proposed to coordinate the conflict between routine tasks and debris avoidance. During the planning for expansion, the temporal constraints for duration actions are handled by the ordering choices. Meanwhile, dynamic resource variables satisfying instantaneous numerical change and continuous linear change are reasoned in the execution of actions. Linear Programming (LP) can solve the bounds of variables in each state, which is used to check the consistency of the interactive constraints on duration and resource. Then, the temporal relaxed planning graph (TRPG) heuristics is rationally developed to guide the plan towards the goal. Finally, the simulation demonstrates that the proposed mission planning strategy can effectively achieve the autonomous debris avoidance of the spacecraft.</description>

Abstract: We leverage best response dynamics to solve monotone variational inequalities on compact and convex sets. Specialization of the method to variational inequalities in game theory recovers convergence results to Nash equilibria when agents select the best response to the current distribution of strategies. We apply the method to generalize population games with additional convex constraints. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the method by introducing various types of time-varying disturbances.</description>

      <title>Participation Factors for Nonlinear Autonomous Dynamical Systems in the Koopman Operator Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a novel formulation and propose the concept of modal participation factors to nonlinear dynamical systems. The original definition of modal participation factors (or simply participation factors) provides a simple yet effective metric. It finds use in theory and practice, quantifying the interplay between states and modes of oscillation in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. In this paper, with the Koopman operator framework, we present the results of participation factors for nonlinear dynamical systems with an asymptotically stable equilibrium point or limit cycle. We show that participation factors are defined for the entire domain of attraction, beyond the vicinity of an attractor, where the original definition of participation factors for LTI systems is a special case. Finally, we develop a numerical method to estimate participation factors using time series data from the underlying nonlinear dynamical system. The numerical method can be implemented by leveraging a well-established numerical scheme in the Koopman operator framework called dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Embedding by Approximate Equitable Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of matrix completion and decomposition in the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices is a well-understood problem, with many important applications in areas such as linear algebra, optimization, and control theory. This paper considers the completion and decomposition problems in a broader class of cones, namely phase-bounded cones. We show that most of the main results from the PSD case carry over to the phase-bounded case. More precisely, this is done by first unveiling a duality between the completion and decomposition problems, using a dual cone interpretation. Based on this, we then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the phase-bounded completion and decomposition problems, and also characterize all phase-bounded completions of a completable partial matrix with a banded pattern.</description>

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring robust safety mechanisms remains an open challenge. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are efficient tools which guarantee safety by solving an optimal control problem. In this work, we consider the case of a teleoperated drone in a VLN setting, and add safety features by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF using ego-centric observations obtained through an RGB-D sensor. As a baseline, we implement a vision-language understanding module which uses the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) model to query about a user-specified (in natural language) landmark. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detector, the CLIP model is queried for verifying the cropped landmark, triggering downstream navigation. To improve navigation safety of the baseline, we propose ASMA -- an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm -- that crops the drone's depth map for tracking moving object(s) to perform scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly. By identifying potential risky observations from the scene, ASMA enables real-time adaptation to unpredictable environmental conditions, ensuring optimal safety bounds on a VLN-powered drone actions. Using the robot operating system (ROS) middleware on a parrot bebop2 quadrotor in the gazebo environment, ASMA offers 59.4% - 61.8% increase in success rates with insignificant 5.4% - 8.2% increases in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN while recovering from unsafe situations.</description>

      <title>Safe and Real-Time Consistent Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Partially Observed Environments via Parallel Consensus Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and driving consistency is a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles operating in partially observed environments. This work introduces a consistent parallel trajectory optimization (CPTO) approach to enable safe and consistent driving in dense obstacle environments with perception uncertainties. Utilizing discrete-time barrier function theory, we develop a consensus safety barrier module that ensures reliable safety coverage within the spatiotemporal trajectory space across potential obstacle configurations. Following this, a bi-convex parallel trajectory optimization problem is derived that facilitates decomposition into a series of low-dimensional quadratic programming problems to accelerate computation. By leveraging the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel optimization, each generated candidate trajectory corresponds to a possible environment configuration while sharing a common consensus trajectory segment. This ensures driving safety and consistency when executing the consensus trajectory segment for the ego vehicle in real time. We validate our CPTO framework through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines across multiple driving tasks in partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate improved safety and consistency using both synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</description>

Abstract: Microgravity mass gauging has gained increasing importance in recent years due to the acceleration in planning for long-term space missions as well as in-space refueling and transfer operations. It is of particular importance with cryogenic propellants where periodic tank venting maneuvers and leak detection place a special emphasis on accurate mass gauging. Several competing technologies have arisen, but capacitance mass gauging has several distinct advantages due to its low mass, non-intrusiveness, and whole volume interrogation technique. Capacitance based measurement has also seen recent success in measuring cryogenic liquid nitrogen and hydrogen volume fraction and flow rate, showing its compatibility with cryogenic propellants. However, the effects of gravity on fluid behavior make the calibration and testing of these sensors difficult on the ground. In this paper a prototype sensor is constructed that can emulate fluid positions in microgravity and earth gravity configurations. Experimental propellant fills and drains are conducted using a simulant fluid with similar electrical properties to cryogenic propellants. This expanded dataset is compared with previous simulation results and used to construct a machine learning model capable of calculating the fluid mass in tanks both with and without propellant management devices.</description>

      <title>Global Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Magnetic Anomaly-Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating and localizing in partially observable, stochastic environments with magnetic anomalies presents significant challenges, especially when balancing the accuracy of state estimation and the stability of localization. Traditional approaches often struggle to maintain performance due to limited localization updates and dynamic conditions. This paper introduces a multi-objective global path planner for magnetic anomaly navigation (MagNav), which leverages entropy maps to assess spatial frequency variations in magnetic fields and identify high-information areas. The system generates paths toward these regions by employing a potential field planner, enhancing active localization. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves localization stability and accuracy compared to existing active localization techniques. The results underscore the effectiveness of this method in reducing localization uncertainty and highlight its adaptability to various gradient-based navigation maps, including topographical and underwater depth-based environments.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Learning-Based Solver for Two-Stage DC Optimal Power Flow with Feasibility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the scenario-based two-stage stochastic DC optimal power flow (OPF) problem for optimal and reliable dispatch when the load is facing uncertainty. Although this problem is a linear program, it remains computationally challenging to solve due to the large number of scenarios needed to accurately represent the uncertainties. To mitigate the computational issues, many techniques have been proposed to approximate the second-stage decisions so they can be dealt more efficiently. The challenge of finding good policies to approximate the second-stage decisions is that these solutions need to be feasible, which has been difficult to achieve with existing policies.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a learning method to solve the two-stage problem in a more efficient and optimal way. A technique called the gauge map is incorporated into the learning architecture design to guarantee the learned solutions' feasibility to the network constraints. Namely, we can design policies that are feed forward functions and only output feasible solutions. Simulation results on standard IEEE systems show that, compared to iterative solvers and the widely used affine policy, our proposed method not only learns solutions of good quality but also accelerates the computation by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective Planning of Decarbonized Power-Gas Infrastructure to Meet the Challenges of Heating Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building heat electrification is central to economy-wide decarbonization efforts and directly affects energy infrastructure planning through increasing electricity demand and reducing the building sector's use of gas infrastructure that also serves the power sector. Here, we develop a modeling framework to quantify end-use demand for electricity and gas in the buildings sector under various electrification pathways and evaluate their impact on co-optimized bulk power-gas infrastructure investments and operations under deep decarbonization scenarios. Applying the framework to study the U.S. New England region in 2050 across 20 weather scenarios, we find high electrification of the residential sector can increase sectoral peak and total electricity demands by up to 56-158% and 41-59% respectively relative to business-as-usual projections. Employing demand-side measures like building envelope improvements under high electrification, however, can reduce the magnitude and weather sensitivity of peak load as well as induce overall efficiency gains, reducing the combined residential sector energy demand for power and gas by 28-30% relative to the present day. Notably, a combination of high electrification and envelope improvements yields the lowest bulk power-gas system cost outcomes. Accounting for \bt{midstream} methane emissions from gas supply chain increase the reliance on low-carbon fuels, which indirectly improves the cost-effectiveness of end-use electrification. Similarly, we find that demand flexibility programs can reduce the total system cost by up to 6.3%.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a class of basis functions for realizing the input-to-state stability verification of identified models obtained from the true system (assumed to be input-to-state stable) using the Koopman operator. The formulated input-to-state stability conditions are in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Two extensions are presented to relax the imposed restrictions on the basis functions. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guided Safety-Aware Model Predictive Control for Jump Markov Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a controller framework that synthesizes control policies for Jump Markov Linear Systems subject to stochastic mode switches and imperfect mode estimation. Our approach builds on safe and robust methods for Model Predictive Control (MPC), but in contrast to existing approaches that either optimize without regard to feasibility or utilize soft constraints that increase computational requirements, we employ a safe and robust control approach informed by the feasibility of the optimization problem. We formulate and encode finite horizon safety for multiple model systems in our MPC design using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). When subject to inaccurate hybrid state estimation, our feasibility-guided MPC generates a control policy that is maximally robust to uncertainty in the system's modes. We evaluate our approach on an orbital rendezvous problem and a six degree-of-freedom hexacopter under several scenarios and benchmarks to demonstrate the utility of the framework. Results indicate that the proposed technique of maximizing the robustness horizon, and the use of CBFs for safety awareness, improve the overall safety and performance of MPC for Jump Markov Linear Systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time Building Energy Storage Scheduling under Electrical Load Uncertainty: A Dynamic Markov Decision Process Approach with Comprehensive Analysis of Different Pricing Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the increasing deployment of battery storage systems for cost reduction and grid stress mitigation, this study presents the development of a new real-time Markov decision process model to efficiently schedule battery systems in buildings under electrical load uncertainty. The proposed model incorporates quantile Fourier regression for load fitting, leading to a large-scale optimization problem with approximately a million decision variables and constraints. To address this complexity, the problem is formulated as a linear program and solved using a commercial solver, ensuring effective navigation and identification of optimal solutions. The model's performance is evaluated by considering different pricing policies and scenarios, including demand peak shaving. Validation of the Markov model is conducted using one year of historical demand data from a school. Findings indicate that MDP performance in adapting to uncertain loads can range from 30 to 99% depending on the pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Toward Microgravity Mass Gauging with Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing: Sensor Design and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of capacitance sensors for fuel mass gauging has been in consideration since the early days of manned space flight. However, certain difficulties arise when considering tanks in microgravity environments. Surface tension effects lead to fluid wetting of the interior surface of the tank, leaving large interior voids, while thrust/settling effects can lead to dispersed two-phase mixtures. With the exception of capacitance-based sensing, few sensing technologies are well suited for measuring annular, stratified, and dispersed fluid configurations. Two modalities of capacitance measurement are compared: Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) and Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing (ECVS). ECVT is a non-invasive imaging modality first introduced in 2006. ECVS is a measurement modality introduced in this paper that is derived from ECVT technology but does not reconstruct an image as part of the mass measurement. To optimize the design of future capacitance-based spherical tank mass gauging sensors, different electrode plate layouts are evaluated in a mass gauging context. Prototype sensors are constructed, and experiments are conducted with fluid fills in various orientations. The plate layouts and their effect on the performance of the sensor as a fuel mass gauge are analyzed through the use of imaging and averaging techniques.</description>

      <title>An Energy-efficient Capacitive-RRAM Content Addressable Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content addressable memory is popular in intelligent computing systems as it allows parallel content-searching in memory. Emerging CAMs show a promising increase in bitcell density and a decrease in power consumption than pure CMOS solutions. This article introduced an energy-efficient 3T1R1C TCAM cooperating with capacitor dividers and RRAM devices. The RRAM as a storage element also acts as a switch to the capacitor divider while searching for content. CAM cells benefit from working parallel in an array structure. We implemented a 64 x 64 array and digital controllers to perform with an internal built-in clock frequency of 875MHz. Both data searches and reads take three clock cycles. Its worst average energy for data match is reported to be 1.71fJ/bit-search and the worst average energy for data miss is found at 4.69fJ/bit-search. The prototype is simulated and fabricated in 0.18um technology with in-lab RRAM post-processing. Such memory explores the charge domain searching mechanism and can be applied to data centers that are power-hungry.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Auto-tuning of Structured LPV Controllers for High-Precision Motion Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion systems are a vital part of many industrial processes. However, meeting the increasingly stringent demands of these systems, especially concerning precision and throughput, requires novel control design methods that can go beyond the capabilities of traditional solutions. Traditional control methods often struggle with the complexity and position-dependent effects inherent in modern motion systems, leading to compromises in performance and a laborious task of controller design. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel structured feedback control auto-tuning approach for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) motion systems. By leveraging frequency response function (FRF) estimates and the linear-parameter-varying (LPV) control framework, the proposed approach automates the controller design, while providing local stability and performance guarantees. Key innovations include norm-based magnitude optimization of the sensitivity functions, an automated stability check through a novel extended factorized Nyquist criterion, a modular structured MIMO LPV controller parameterization, and a controller discretization approach which preserves the continuous-time (CT) controller parameterization. The proposed approach is validated through experiments using a state-of-the-art moving-magnet planar actuator prototype.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Boundary Control of Mixed-autonomy Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control problems of mixed-autonomy traffic systems that consist of both human-driven vehicles (HV) and autonomous vehicles (AV), have gained increasing attention. This paper focuses on suppressing traffic oscillations in the mixed-autonomy traffic system using boundary control design. The mixed traffic dynamics are described by 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), governing the propagation of four waves of traffic, including the density of HV, the density of AV, the friction between the two vehicle classes from driving interactions and the averaged velocity. We propose an event-triggered boundary control design since control signals of the traffic light on ramp or the varying speed limit cannot be continuously updated. We apply the event-triggered mechanism for a PDE backstepping controller and obtain a dynamic triggering condition. Lyapunov analysis is performed to prove the exponential stability of the closed-loop system with the event-triggered controller. Numerical simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed event-trigger control design. We analyzed how the car-following spacing of AV affects the event-triggering mechanism of the control input in mixed-autonomy traffic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of hierarchical control architectures for autonomous systems with energy constraints. We focus on systems where energy storage limitations and slow recharge rates drastically affect the way the autonomous systems are operated. Using examples from space robotics and public transportation, we motivate the need for formally designed learning hierarchical control systems. We propose a learning control architecture which incorporates learning mechanisms at various levels of the control hierarchy to improve performance and resource utilization. The proposed hierarchical control scheme relies on high-level energy-aware task planning and assignment, complemented by a low-level predictive control mechanism responsible for the autonomous execution of tasks, including motion control and energy management. Simulation examples show the benefits and the limitations of the proposed architecture when learning is used to obtain a more energy-efficient task allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a problem of optimal swarm tracking which can be formulated as a tracking problem for distributions in the Wasserstein space. Optimal solutions to this problem are non-causal and require knowing the time-trajectory of the reference distribution in advance. We propose a scheme where these non-causal solutions can be used together with a predictive model for the reference to achieve causal tracking of a priori-unknown references. We develop a model-predictive control scheme built around the simple case where the reference is constant-in-time. A computational algorithm based on particle methods and discrete optimal mass transport is presented, and numerical simulations are provided for various classes of reference signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed control algorithm achieves reasonable performance even when using simple predictive models.</description>

      <title>Decoupling parameter variation from noise: Biquadratic Lyapunov forms in data-driven LPV control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising step from linear towards nonlinear data-driven control is via the design of controllers for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, which are linear systems whose parameters are varying along a measurable scheduling signal. However, the interplay between uncertainty arising from corrupted data and the parameter-varying nature of these systems impacts the stability analysis and limits the generalization of well-understood data-driven methods available for linear time-invariant systems. In this work, we decouple this interplay using a recently developed variant of the Fundamental Lemma for LPV systems and the concept of data-informativity, in combination with biquadratic Lyapunov forms. Together, these allow us to develop novel linear matrix inequality conditions for the existence of scheduling-dependent Lyapunov functions, incorporating the intrinsic nonlinearity. Appealingly, these results are stated purely in terms of the collected data and bounds on the noise, and they are computationally favorable to check.</description>

      <title>ANOCA: AC Network-aware Optimal Curtailment Approach for Dynamic Hosting Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With exponential growth in distributed energy resources (DERs) coupled with at-capacity distribution grid infrastructure, prosumers cannot always export all extra power to the grid without violating technical limits. Consequently, a slew of dynamic hosting capacity (DHC) algorithms have emerged for optimal utilization of grid infrastructure while maximizing export from DERs. Most of these DHC algorithms utilize the concept of operating envelopes (OE), where the utility gives prosumers technical power export limits, and they are free to export power within these limits. Recent studies have shown that OE-based frameworks have drawbacks, as most develop power export limits based on convex or linear grid models. As OEs must capture extreme operating conditions, both convex and linear models can violate technical limits in practice because they approximate grid physics. However, AC models are unsuitable because they may not be feasible within the whole region of OE. We propose a new two-stage optimization framework for DHC built on three-phase AC models to address the current gaps. In this approach, the prosumers first run a receding horizon multi-period optimization to identify optimal export power setpoints to communicate with the utility. The utility then performs an infeasibility-based optimization to either accept the prosumer's request or dispatch an optimal curtail signal such that overall system technical constraints are not violated. To explore various curtailment strategies, we develop an L1, L2, and Linf norm-based dispatch algorithm with an exact three-phase AC model. We test our framework on a 1420 three-phase node meshed distribution network and show that the proposed algorithm optimally curtails DERs while guaranteeing the AC feasibility of the network.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ESs, such as predator-prey dynamics. The stability of the equilibrium is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transient states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear differential equations are encountered as models of fluid flow, spiking neurons, and many other systems of interest in the real world. Common features of these systems are that their behaviors are difficult to describe exactly and invariably unmodeled dynamics present challenges in making precise predictions. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator based on Koopman operator theory to extract meaningful finite-dimensional representations of complex non-linear systems. The Koopman model is used together with deep reinforcement networks that learn the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of nonlinear systems. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the estimated nonlinear system, which enables it to compute optimal state estimates without re-learning.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Tube-based Control Synthesis of Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the control design of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems (MASs) under a global signal temporal logic (STL) specification to be satisfied at a predefined probability. By decomposing the dynamics into deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and relax the underlying stochastic problem with a deterministic one. This approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.</description>

Abstract: Soft sensing is a way to indirectly obtain information of signals for which direct sensing is difficult or prohibitively expensive. It may not \textit{a priori} be evident which sensors provide useful information about the target signal, and various operating conditions often necessitate different models. In this paper, we provide a systematic method to construct a soft sensor that can deal with these issues. We propose a single estimation criterion, where the objectives are encoded in terms of model fit, model sparsity (reducing the number of different models), and model parameter coefficient sparsity (to exclude irrelevant sensors). The proposed method is tested on real-world scenarios involving prototype vehicles, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model (LLM) for Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Survey on Principles, Key Techniques, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable attention recently due to their outstanding comprehension and reasoning capabilities, leading to great progress in many fields. The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for LLM-aided prediction problems, we discussed time-series prediction models and multi-modality prediction problems for telecom. Finally, we highlight the challenges and identify the future directions of LLM-enabled telecom networks.</description>

      <title>Reliable State Estimation in a Truck-Semitrailer Combination using an Artificial Neural Network-Aided Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems are critically dependent on reliable and accurate information regarding a vehicles' driving state. For estimation of unknown quantities, model-based and learning-based methods exist, but both suffer from individual limitations. On the one hand, model-based estimation performance is often limited by the models' accuracy. On the other hand, learning-based estimators usually do not perform well in "unknown" conditions (bad generalization), which is particularly critical for semitrailers as their payload changes significantly in operation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to analyze the capability of state-of-the-art estimators for semitrailers to generalize across "unknown" loading states. Moreover, a novel hybrid Extended Kalman Filter (H-EKF) that takes advantage of accurate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimates while preserving reliable generalization capability is presented. It estimates the articulation angle between truck and semitrailer, lateral tire forces and the truck steering angle utilizing sensor data of a standard semitrailer only. An experimental comparison based on a full-scale truck-semitrailer combination indicates the superiority of the H-EKF compared to a state-of-the-art extended Kalman filter and an ANN estimator.</description>

      <title>Verification and Synthesis of Compatible Control Lyapunov and Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety and stability are essential properties of control systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) are powerful tools to ensure safety and stability respectively. However, previous approaches typically verify and synthesize the CBFs and CLFs separately, satisfying their respective constraints, without proving that the CBFs and CLFs are compatible with each other, namely at every state, there exists control actions within the input limits that satisfy both the CBF and CLF constraints simultaneously. Ignoring the compatibility criteria might cause the CLF-CBF-QP controller to fail at runtime. There exists some recent works that synthesized compatible CLF and CBF, but relying on nominal polynomial or rational controllers, which is just a sufficient but not necessary condition for compatibility. In this work, we investigate verification and synthesis of compatible CBF and CLF independent from any nominal controllers. We derive exact necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility, and further formulate Sum-Of-Squares programs for the compatibility verification.
  Based on our verification framework, we also design a nominal-controller-free synthesis method, which can effectively expands the compatible region, in which the system is guaranteed to be both safe and stable. We evaluate our method on a non-linear toy problem, and also a 3D quadrotor to demonstrate its scalability.

      <title>Humidity-Aware Model Predictive Control for Residential Air Conditioning: A Field Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control of residential air conditioning could reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining or improving occupants' thermal comfort. However, most approaches to predictive air conditioning control either do not model indoor humidity or treat it as constant. This simplification stems from challenges with modeling indoor humidity dynamics, particularly the high-order, nonlinear equations that govern heat and mass transfer between the air conditioner's evaporator coil and the indoor air. This paper develops a machine-learning approach to modeling indoor humidity dynamics that is suitable for real-world deployment at scale. This study then investigates the value of humidity modeling in four field tests of predictive control in an occupied house. The four field tests evaluate two different building models: One with constant humidity and one with time-varying humidity. Each modeling approach is tested in two different predictive controllers: One that focuses on reducing energy costs and one that focuses on constraining electric power below a utility-specified threshold. The two models lead to similar performance for reducing energy costs. Combining the results of this study and a prior heating study of the same house, the estimated year-round energy cost savings were $340-497 or 22-31% (95% confidence intervals); these savings were consistent across both humidity models. However, in the demand response tests, the simplifying assumption of constant humidity led to far more frequent and severe violations of the power constraint. These results suggest that accurate building models are important for nonlinear objectives, such as reducing or constraining peak demand, while for linear objectives such as reducing energy costs or emissions, model accuracy is less important.</description>

      <title>Experimental Benchmarking of Energy-saving Sub-Optimal Sliding Mode Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced energy-saving extension of the sub-optimal sliding mode control allows for control-off phases during the convergence to second-order equilibrium. This way, it enables for a lower energy consumption compared to the original sub-optimal sliding mode (SM) algorithm, both commutating a discontinuous control signal. In this paper, the energy-saving sub-optimal SM control is experimentally benchmarked against a standard second-order SM controller which also has a discontinuous control action. Here the so-called terminal second-order SM algorithm is used. The controlled plant is affected by the matched bounded disturbances which are unknown, and the output is additionally subject to the sensor noise. Moreover, a first-order actuator dynamics can lead to chattering, which is parasitic for SM applications. For a fair comparison, the same quadratic terminal surface is designed when benchmarking both SM controllers. Both experimentally compared SM algorithms have the same (bounded) control magnitude and states initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Network Topology Switching for Zero Dynamics Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic, sampling, and enforced zero dynamics attacks (ZDAs) are among the most detrimental stealthy attacks in robotics, aerospace, and cyber-physical systems. They exploit internal dynamics, discretization, redundancy/asynchronous actuation and sensing, to construct disruptive attacks that are completely stealthy in the measurement. They work even when the systems are both controllable and observable. This paper presents a novel framework to robustly and optimally detect and mitigate ZDAs for networked linear control systems. We utilize controllability, observability, robustness, and sensitivity metrics written explicitly in terms of the system topology, thereby proposing a robust and optimal switching topology formulation for resilient ZDA detection and mitigation. Our main contribution is the reformulation of this problem into an equivalent rank-constrained optimization problem (i.e., optimization with a convex objective function subject to convex constraints and rank constraints), which can be solved using convex rank minimization approaches. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using networked double integrators subject to ZDAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern control designs in robotics, aerospace, and cyber-physical systems rely heavily on real-world data obtained through system outputs. However, these outputs can be compromised by system faults and malicious attacks, distorting critical system information needed for secure and reliable operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel regret-optimal control framework for designing controllers that make a linear system robust against stealthy attacks, including both sensor and actuator attacks. Specifically, we present (a) a convex optimization-based system metric to quantify the regret under the worst-case stealthy attack (the difference between actual performance and optimal performance with hindsight of the attack), which adapts and improves upon the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms in the presence of stealthy adversaries, (b) an optimization problem for minimizing the regret of (a) in system-level parameterization, enabling localized and distributed implementation in large-scale systems, and (c) a rank-constrained optimization problem equivalent to the optimization of (b), which can be solved using convex rank minimization methods. We also present numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the analysis and implementation of the Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) strategy for inverters aiming to enhance stability amidst the ever-increasing generation of renewable energy sources like solar PV. Key objectives include implementation and analysis of a Dead-Zone VOC (DZVOC) three-phase battery-inverter system with an additional voltage control loop, study of its stability and performance in an isolated micro-grid and exploration of their use alongside widely used grid following PV-inverter system. By modeling independent microgrids under various cases with scenarios: VOC inverters of varying capacities and VOC inverters in conjunction with PV inverters, this research addresses critical aspects of power-sharing, compatibility, response times, and fault ride-through potential, as well as improving the voltage droop profile of a general DZVOC control. The simulation is executed in MATLAB SIMULINK and validated with real-time simulation using the Typhoon-HIL 404.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) have become increasingly popular in online learning control systems due to their ease of training. However, online learning ESN controllers often suffer from slow convergence during the initial transient phase. Existing solutions, such as prior training, control mode switching, and incorporating plant dynamic approximations, have notable drawbacks, including undermining the system's online learning property or relying on prior knowledge of the controlled system. This work proposes a simple yet effective approach to address the slow initial convergence of online learning ESN control systems by integrating a feedback proportional-derivative (P-D) controller. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control system achieves rapid convergence during the initial transient phase and shows strong robustness against changes in the controlled system's dynamics and variations in the online learning model's hyperparameters. We show that the feedback controller accelerates convergence by guiding the online learning ESN to operate within a data range well-suited for learning. This study offers practical benefits for engineers aiming to implement online learning ESN control systems with fast convergence and easy deployment.</description>

      <title>Flight Testing of Latch Valve with Lightweight LV-Servo Direct Drive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of rocket technology, the latch valve assumes a pivotal role in regulating the flow of fuel gases and liquids to ensure the requisite energy supply. This project endeavors to innovate by replacing the conventional step motor mechanism with a servo motor for latch valve control. The selected servo motor, boasting a more compact form factor and reduced mass, aligns seamlessly with the project's overarching objectives. While servo motors offer myriad advantages, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the constraints of their maximum output torque to guarantee the latch valve's reliable operation. Furthermore, as a rocket ascends, it encounters significant fluctuations in internal temperature and pressure. Consequently, rigorous environmental testing becomes paramount to validate the servo motor's performance under these dynamic conditions, thus ensuring the latch valve's unwavering functionality. The primary focus of this project is the design and testing of the mechanism's performance in simulated rocket environments, achieved through the implementation of the servo motor for latch valve control. The results reveal that the servo motor demonstrated its effectiveness and reliability in controlling the latch valve under the rigorous environmental conditions of rocket flight.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Position-and-Stiffness Control of Underactuated Antagonistic Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum robots have gained widespread popularity due to their inherent compliance and flexibility, particularly their adjustable levels of stiffness for various application scenarios. Despite efforts to dynamic modeling and control synthesis over the past decade, few studies have incorporated stiffness regulation into their feedback control design; however, this is one of the initial motivations to develop continuum robots. This paper addresses the crucial challenge of controlling both the position and stiffness of underactuated continuum robots actuated by antagonistic tendons. We begin by presenting a rigid-link dynamical model that can analyze the open-loop stiffening of tendon-driven continuum robots. Based on this model, we propose a novel passivity-based position-and-stiffness controller that adheres to the non-negative tension constraint. Comprehensive experiments on our continuum robot validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy and precision of this approach.</description>

      <title>MPS: A New Method for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Equilibrium Attitude-Error Quaternion of a UAV During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present model predictive selection (MPS), a new method for selecting the stable closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ) of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during the execution of high-speed yaw maneuvers. In this approach, we minimize the cost of yawing measured with a performance figure of merit (PFM) that takes into account both the aerodynamic-torque control input and attitude-error state of the UAV. Specifically, this method uses a control law with a term whose sign is dynamically switched in real time to select, between two options, the torque associated with the lesser cost of rotation as predicted by a dynamical model of the UAV derived from first principles. This problem is relevant because the selection of the stable CL equilibrium AEQ significantly impacts the performance of a UAV during high-speed rotational flight, from both the power and control-error perspectives. To test and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed method, we present data collected during one hundred real-time high-speed yaw-tracking flight experiments. These results highlight the superior capabilities of the proposed MPS-based scheme when compared to a benchmark controller commonly used in aerial robotics, as the PFM used to quantify the cost of flight is reduced by 60.30 %, on average. To our best knowledge, these are the first flight-test results that thoroughly demonstrate, evaluate, and compare the performance of a real-time controller capable of selecting the stable CL equilibrium AEQ during operation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Planning for Filming Groups of Moving Actors Leveraging Submodularity and Pixel Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing and filming a group of moving actors with a team of aerial robots is a challenging problem that combines elements of multi-robot coordination, coverage, and view planning. A single camera may observe multiple actors at once, and a robot team may observe individual actors from multiple views. As actors move about, groups may split, merge, and reform, and robots filming these actors should be able to adapt smoothly to such changes in actor formations. Rather than adopt an approach based on explicit formations or assignments, we propose an approach based on optimizing views directly. We model actors as moving polyhedra and compute approximate pixel densities for each face and camera view. Then, we propose an objective that exhibits diminishing returns as pixel densities increase from repeated observation. This gives rise to a multi-robot perception planning problem that we solve via a combination of value iteration and greedy submodular maximization. We evaluate our approach on challenging scenarios modeled after various social behaviors and featuring different numbers of robots and actors and observe that robot assignments and formations arise implicitly given the movements of groups of actors. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines, and in addition to performing well with the planner's approximation of pixel densities our approach also performs comparably for evaluation based on rendered views. Overall, the multi-round variant of the sequential planner we propose meets (within 1%) or exceeds formation and assignment baselines in all scenarios.</description>

      <title>Expected Time-Optimal Control: a Particle Model Predictive Control-based Approach via Sequential Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimum-time optimal control for a dynamical system with initial state uncertainties and propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) solution framework. We seek to minimize the expected terminal (mission) time, which is an essential capability for planetary exploration missions where ground rovers have to carry out scientific tasks efficiently within the mission timelines in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to convert the underlying stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic, numerically tractable, optimal control problem. To this end, the proposed solution framework combines two strategies from previous methods: i) a partial model predictive control with consensus horizon approach and ii) a sum-of-norm cost, a temporally strictly increasing weighted-norm, promoting minimum-time trajectories. Our contribution is to adopt these formulations into an SCP solution framework and obtain a numerically tractable stochastic control algorithm. We then demonstrate the resulting control method in multiple applications: i) a closed-loop linear system as a representative result (a spacecraft double integrator model), ii) an open-loop linear system (the same model), and then iii) a nonlinear system (Dubin's car).</description>

      <title>Kinetic and Kinematic Sensors-free Approach for Estimation of Continuous Force and Gesture in sEMG Prosthetic Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regression-based sEMG prosthetic hands are widely used for their ability to provide continuous kinetic and kinematic parameters. However, establishing these models requires complex sensors systems to collect corresponding kinetic and kinematic data in synchronization with sEMG, which is cumbersome and user-unfriendly. This paper proposes a kinetic and kinematic sensors-free approach for controlling sEMG prosthetic hands, enabling continuous decoding and execution of three hand movements: individual finger flexion/extension, multiple finger flexion/extension, and fist opening/closing. This approach utilizes only two data points (-1 and 1), representing maximal finger flexion force label and extension force label respectively, and their corresponding sEMG data to establish a near-linear model based on sEMG data and labels. The model's output labels values are used to control the direction and magnitude of fingers forces, enabling the estimation of continuous gestures. To validate this approach, we conducted offline and online experiments using four models: Dendritic Net (DD), Linear Net (LN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The offline analysis assessed each model's ability to classify finger force direction and interpolate intermediate force values, while online experiments evaluated real-time control performance in controlling gestures and accurately adjusting forces. Our results demonstrate that the DD and LN models provide excellent real-time control of finger forces and gestures, highlighting the practical potential of this sensors-free approach for prosthetic applications. This study significantly reduces the complexity of collecting kinetic and kinematic parameters in sEMG-based regression prosthetics, thus enhancing the usability and convenience of prosthetic hands.</description>

      <title>Learning Equilibrium with Estimated Payoffs in Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in population games, where agents select from multiple available strategies and continually revise their selections based on the payoffs associated with these strategies. Unlike conventional population game formulations, we consider a scenario where agents must estimate the payoffs through local measurements and communication with their neighbors. By employing task allocation games -- dynamic extensions of conventional population games -- we examine how errors in payoff estimation by individual agents affect the convergence of the strategy revision process. Our main contribution is an analysis of how estimation errors impact the convergence of the agents' strategy profile to equilibrium. Based on the analytical results, we propose a design for a time-varying strategy revision rate to guarantee convergence. Simulation studies illustrate how the proposed method for updating the revision rate facilitates convergence to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic energy forecasting through quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</description>

      <title>Robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery Guarantees for Parameterized Non-linear System Identification Problem under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the system identification problem for parameterized non-linear systems using basis functions under adversarial attacks. Motivated by the LASSO-type estimators, we analyze the exact recovery property of a non-smooth estimator, which is generated by solving an embedded $\ell_1$-loss minimization problem. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-specifiedness of the estimator and the uniqueness of global solutions to the underlying optimization problem. Next, we provide exact recovery guarantees for the estimator under two different scenarios of boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of the basis functions. The non-asymptotic exact recovery is guaranteed with high probability, even when there are more severely corrupted data than clean data. Finally, we numerically illustrate the validity of our theory. This is the first study on the sample complexity analysis of a non-smooth estimator for the non-linear system identification problem.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic, uncertain, societal-scale systems. In these settings, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often without knowledge of others' strategies. Designing decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remains challenging, especially beyond Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture the mixed cooperative-competitive nature of real-world interactions. Our paper focuses on designing decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria. We introduce a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF), and show that MNPF plays a central role in the analysis of convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning dynamics to approximate Nash equilibria. Our analysis leverages the two-timescale nature of actor-critic algorithms, where Q-function updates occur faster than policy updates. This result is further strengthened under certain regularity conditions and when the set of Nash equilibria is finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis of decentralized learning in multi-agent systems, addressing the complexities of real-world interactions.</description>
