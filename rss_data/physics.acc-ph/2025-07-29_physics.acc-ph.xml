      <title>Radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency undulators is developed. It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum (TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Twinac: A Universal Framework for Virtual Accelerator Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for a system of virtual accelerator controls (Twinac), a standard toolkit for research institutions to design, maintain, and use a real-time, end-to-end "digital twin" of their particle accelerator facility. This virtual counterpart will mirror any physical accelerator to provide (1) predictive maintenance; (2) surveillance of hidden environmental factors, such as seasonal temperature variations, which could impact performance of power supplies, magnets, and other instruments; and (3) a capability to model novel ways to operate the accelerator without risking equipment damage. Twinac is envisioned as accelerator facility agnostic, allowing institutions to share and reuse myriad simulation approaches (analytics-based, A.I.-driven, or combinations of the like) across facilities. The Twinac system lays the groundwork for a collaborative network of institutions to maintain and update this shared virtual accelerator technology.</description>

      <title>Rapid-cycling ReBCO dipole magnet concept for muon acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concept of the rapid-cycling 1.7 T ReBCO magnet for 1 to 10 kT/s ramping range as required for muon acceleration in a future muon collider presently under study. This approach is based on the 6 kA CORC-like cable constructed with 12 superconducting ReBCO tapes of 2 mm width. Based on theoretical prediction there is a linear scaling of the ReBCO cable hysteresis loss with the crossing magnetic field possibly generating power loss independent of the magnetic field ramping speed. This feature makes this ReBCO cable suitable for the construction of rapid-cycling magnets. In this work we outline the design of a dipole magnet for 1.7 T gap magnetic field and discuss the helium coolant parameters for the minimal electric power.</description>

      <title>Numerical Studies for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB Plasma Beam Driven Working Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of a plasma based user facility on the model of EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB requires to design a working point for the operation that allows to get an high accelerating gradient preserving a low emittance and low energy spread of the accelerated beam. Such beam is supposed to pilot a soft x-ray free electron laser with a wavelength of 2-\SI{4}{\nano\meter}. In this work several simulation scans are presented, varying at the same time the plasma density and driver-witness separation in order to show that, in a realistic working point for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB, it is possible to find an ideal compromise for a witness with a peak current &gt;1kA that allows to preserve the energy spread of the core (80\% of the charge) below 0.1\%, while maintaining an accelerating gradient inside the plasma module around of 1 GV/m. The study is completed with a parametric analysis with the aim of establishing the stability requirements of the RF working point and the plasma channel in order to preserve the energy jitter at the same level of the energy spread.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>
