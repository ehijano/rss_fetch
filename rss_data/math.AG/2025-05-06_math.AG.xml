      <title>Variation of Tannaka groups of perverse sheaves in family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$, let $S$ be a smooth, geometrically connected variety over $k$, with generic point $\eta$, and $f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow S$ a morphism separated and of finite type. Fix a prime $\ell$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ be an $f$-universally locally acyclic relative perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}/S$. We prove that if for some (equivalently, every) geometric point $\bar \eta$ over $\eta$ the restriction $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar \eta}}$ is simple as a perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}_{\bar \eta}$, then there is a non-empty open subscheme $U\subset S$ such that, for every geometric point $\bar s$ on $U$, the restriction $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}}$ is simple as a perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf on $\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}$. When $f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow S$ is an abelian scheme, we give applications of this result to the variation with $s\in S$ of the Tannaka group of $\mathbb{P}|_{\mathbb{X}_{\bar s}}$.</description>

      <title>Free line arrangements with low maximal multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a free arrangement of $d$ lines in the complex projective plane, with exponents $d_1\leq d_2$. Let $m$ be the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal{A}$. In this note, we describe first the simple cases $d_1 \leq m$. Then we study the case $d_1=m+1$, and describe which line arrangements can occur by deleting or adding a line to $\mathcal{A}$. When $d \leq 14$, there are only two free arrangements with $d_1=m+2$, namely one with degree $13$ and the other with degree $14$. We study their geometries in order to deepen our understanding of the structure of free line arrangements in general.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we correct some of the results of \cite{HL22} concerning the number of maximal cones in the Mori fan of the Dolgachev-Nikulin-Voisin fan in genus $2$. The mistakes in the original paper concern the correct enumeration of cones. The method and the main theoretical results are not affected.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of a generalized flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simply connected semisimple complex algebraic group and $P\, \subset\, G$ a parabolic subgroup. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a line bundle, on the blow-up of the generalized flag variety $G/P$ along a smooth Schubert variety, to be ample (respectively, nef). Furthermore, it is shown that every such nef line bundle is globally generated. As a consequence, we describe when such a blow-up is (weak) Fano.</description>

      <title>Double shuffle Lie algebra and special derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racinet's double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{tder}$ of tangential derivations of the free Lie algebra with generators $x_0,x_1$, i.e. of derivations such that $x_1\mapsto 0$ and $x_0\mapsto [a,x_0]$ for some element $a$. We prove: (1) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is contained in the Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{sder}$ of $\mathfrak{tder}$ of special derivations, i.e. satisfying the additional condition that $x_\infty\mapsto [b,x_\infty]$ for some element $b$, where $x_\infty:=x_1-x_0$; (2) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is stable under the involution of $\mathfrak{sder}$ induced by the exchange of $x_0$ and $x_\infty$. The first statement: (a) says that any element of $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ satisfies the "senary relation" (a fact announced without proof by Ecalle in 2011); (b) implies the inclusion $\mathfrak{dmr}_0\subset \mathfrak{krv}_2$ (which was proved by Schneps in 2012 only conditionally to the truth of (1)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper disprove a conjecture by Pal and Budaghyan (DCC, 2024) on the existence of a family of APN permutations, but showing that if the field's cardinality $q$ is larger than~$9587$, then those functions will never be APN. Moreover, we discuss other connected families of functions, for potential APN functions, but we show that they are not good candidates for APNess if the underlying field is large, in spite of the fact that they though they are APN for small environments.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Stable Infinity Categories with Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 2000s, Balmer constructed a ringed space from a triangulated category with a tensor structure. It provides a beautiful classification of tensor ideals. However, some categories, such as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves or the triangulated category of singularities of a scheme, do not have canonical tensor structures. We constructed a ringed space from a stable \(\infty\)-category with action as an analog. The aforementioned examples have canonical action of the category of perfect complexes, and their associated spaces contain information about the singularities of the scheme.
  Recently, Matsui introduced a ringed space from a triangulated category. However, it can be huge and hard to calculate. Our approach describes subspaces of the Matsui spectrum, which is more manageable due to their fiber decomposition.</description>

      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. We show the complete prime spectrum is functorial and give a characterization of when a monoidal exact functor induces a well-defined map on noncommutative Balmer spectra. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I use methods of Chai-Hida and ordinary $p$-Hecke correspondences to study the set of irreducible components of special fibers of special cycles of sufficiently low codimension in integral models of GSpin Shimura varieties, and apply this to prove irreducibility results for the special fibers of the moduli of polarized K3 surfaces. These results are also applied in joint work with Howard on the modularity of generating series of higher codimension cycles on GSpin Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a motivic refinement of a result of Weil, Deligne and Raynaud on the existence of strongly compatible systems associated to abelian varieties. More precisely, given
  an abelian variety $A$ over a number field $\mathrm{E}\subset \mathbb C$, we prove that after replacing $\mathbb E$ by a finite extension, the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathrm E}/\mathrm E)$ on the $\ell$-adic cohomology $\mathrm H^1_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(A_{\overline{\mathrm E}},\mathbb Q_\ell)$ gives rise to a strongly compatible system of $\ell$-adic representations valued in the Mumford--Tate group $\mathbf G$ of $A$. This involves an independence of $\ell$-statement for the Weil--Deligne representation associated to $A$ at places of semistable reduction, extending previous work of ours at places of good reduction.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between multiple polylogarithms on a torus and the Steinberg module of $\mathbb{Q}$, and show that multiple polylogarithms of depth $d$ and weight $n$ can be expressed via a single function $\mathrm{Li}_{n-d+1,1,\dots,1}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d)$. Using this connection, we give a simple proof of the Bykovski\u{\i} theorem, explain the duality between multiple polylogarithms and iterated integrals, and provide a polylogarithmic interpretation of the conjectures of Rognes and Church-Farb-Putman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime number and $\mathrm{j}_p$ the $p$-complete connective image of J spectrum. We establish an equivalence of cyclotomic $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings $\mathrm{THH}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p \simeq \mathrm{sh}(\mathrm{j}_p^{\mathrm{triv}})$ and an equivalence of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings $\mathrm{TP}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p \simeq \mathrm{j}_p^{\mathrm{t}\mathrm{S}^1}$. We also record a few applications of this: a new perspective, with some new information, on the description of $\mathrm{TC}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p$ as a spectrum; height $1$ analogues of the fiber squares of Antieau-Mathew-Morrow-Nikolaus, resulting in new calculations in $\mathrm{K}(1)$-localized algebraic K-theory; and a proof of a slight refinement of the noncommutative crystalline-de Rham comparison result of Petrov-Vologodsky.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1701.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general method for producing various effective Null and Positivstellens\"atze, and getting new Positivstellens\"atze in algebraically closed valued fields and ordered groups. These various effective Nullstellens\"atze produce algebraic identities certifying that some geometric conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We produce also constructive versions of abstract classical results of algebra based on Zorn's lemma in several cases where such constructive version did not exist. For example, the fact that a real field can be totally ordered, or the fact that a field can be embedded in an algebraically closed field. Our results are based on the concepts we develop of dynamical proofs and simultaneous collapse.</description>

Abstract: The famous theorem of Belyi can be viewed as a characterization of compact Riemann surfaces which admit a non-empty open subset uniformized by a subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of finite index. I show that if $q\geq 5$, then ${\bf F}_q(T)$ is the one and only function field of positive characteristic for which such an analogous characterization of rigid analytic spaces of dimension one can exist and that Drinfel$'$d modular curves provide examples of rigid analytic spaces of this type.</description>

      <title>Strong desingularization of semialgebraic sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hironaka's resolution of singularities of algebraic varieties (over a field of characteristic $0$) is a widespread celebrated discipline that has many applications in many areas of Mathematics. Bierstone and Parusi\'nski studied the desingularization of closed subanalytic sets and in particular of closed semialgebraic sets.
  Our starting point is Bierstone and Parusi\'nski's results, but in this work we study desingularization of semialgebraic sets with some purposes in mind: (1) to deal with arbitrary semialgebraic sets (and not only with the closed ones), (2) to use (as desingularizating models) Nash manifolds with corners (instead of closures of unions of connected components of the complements of normal crossing divisors of non-singular real algebraic sets), (3) to have (as desingularizating maps) surjective algebraic maps and (4) to preserve analytic path-connected components.
  We also show how to `build' a Nash manifold with corners ${\mathcal Q}\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ from a suitable Nash manifold $M\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ (of its same dimension), which contains ${\mathcal Q}$ as a closed subset, by folding $M$ along the irreducible components of a normal-crossings divisor of $M$, which is the smallest Nash subset of $M$ that contains the boundary $\partial{\mathcal Q}$ of ${\mathcal Q}$.
  We propose several applications of the previous results: (1) Weak desingularization of closed semialgebraic sets using Nash manifolds with (smooth) boundary, (2) Representation of compact semialgebraic sets connected by analytic paths as images under Nash maps of closed unit balls, (3) Explicit construction of Nash models for compact orientable smooth surfaces of genus $g\geq0$, and (4) Nash approximation of continuous semialgebraic maps whose target spaces are Nash manifolds with corners.</description>

      <title>L\"uroth's theorem for fields of rational functions in infinitely many permuted variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\"uroth's theorem describes the dominant maps from rational curves over a field.
  In this note we study those dominant rational maps from cartesian powers $X^{\Psi}$ of geometrically irreducible varieties $X$ over a field $k$ for infinite sets $\Psi$ that are equivariant with respect to all permutations of the factors $X$. At least some of such maps arise as compositions $h:X^{\Psi}\xrightarrow{f^{\Psi}}Y^{\Psi}\to H\backslash Y^{\Psi}$, where $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is a group of birational automorphisms of $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^{\Psi}$.
  In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified, gives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^{\Psi}$, if $\dim X=1$. For arbitrary $X$, the results are only partial.
  Also, a somewhat similar problem of describing the equivariant integral schemes over $X^{\Psi}$ of finite type is touched very briefly.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general result on the existence of irreducible symplectic compactifications of non-compact Lagrangian fibrations. As an application, we show that the relative Jacobian fibration of cubic fivefolds containing a fixed cubic fourfold can be compactified by a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial terminal irreducible symplectic variety with the second Betti number at least 24, and admits a Lagrangian fibration whose base is a weighted projective space. In particular, it belongs to a new deformation type of irreducible symplectic varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the theory of Seshadri stratifications to embedded toric varieties $X_P\subseteq \mathbb P(V)$ associated with a normal lattice polytope $P$. The approach presented here is purely combinatorial and completely independent of \cite{CFL}. In particular, we get a close connection between a certain class of triangulations of the polytope $P$, Seshadri stratifications of $X_P$ arising from torus orbit closures, and the associated degenerate semi-toric varieties. In the last section we show that the approach here and the one in \cite{CFL} produce the same quasi-valuations and hence the same degenerations of $X_P$.</description>

      <title>Algebraically Skew Embeddings of Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth complex variety $X$, an algebraically skew embedding of $X$ is an embedding of $X$ into a complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^N$ such that for any two points $x,y\in X$, their embedded tangent spaces in $\mathbb{P}^N$ do not intersect. In this work, we establish an upper bound and a lower bound of the minimal dimension $N$ such that there exists an algebraically skew embedding into $\mathbb{P}^N$ in terms of the dimension of the given smooth variety $X$. Then we further classify the algebraic curves in terms of their minimal skew embedding dimensions, and apply the same technique to other one-parameter family of lines.</description>

Abstract: We prove the rationality and irreducibility of the moduli space of mathematical instanton vector bundles of arbitrary rank and charge on $\mathbb P^3$. In particular, the result applies to the rank-2 case. This problem was first studied by Barth, Ellingsrud-Stromme, Hartshorne, Hirschowitz-Narasimhan in the late 1970s. We also show that the mathematical instantons of variable rank and charge form a monoidal category. The proof is based on an in-depth analysis of the Barth-Hulek monad-construction and on a detailed description of the moduli space of (framed and unframed) stable bundles on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of an Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface is a complex K3 surface of Picard number 19 that is birational to a general member of a certain one-dimensional family of affine surfaces related to the Fermi surface in solid-state physics. This K3 surface is also linked to a recurrence relation that appears in the famous proof of the irrationality of zeta(3) by Ap\'ery. We compute the automorphism group Aut(X) of the Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface X using Borcherds' method. We describe Aut(X) in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, we determine the action of Aut(X) on the set of ADE-configurations of smooth rational curves on X for some ADE-types. In particular, we show that Aut(X) acts transitively on the set of smooth rational curves, and that it partitions the set of pairs of disjoint smooth rational curves into two orbits.</description>

      <title>On Almost Strong Approximation in Reductive Algebraic Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a slight weakening of the classical property of strong approximation, which we call almost strong approximation, for connected reductive algebraic group over global fields with respect to special sets of valuations. While nonsimply connected groups (in particular, all algebraic tori) always fail to have strong approximation - and even almost strong approximation -- with respect to any finite set of valuations, we show that under appropriate assumptions they do have almost strong approximation with respect to (infinite) tractable sets of valuations, i.e. those sets that contain all archimedean valuations and a generalized arithmetic progression minus a set having Dirichlet density zero. Almost strong approximation is likely to have a variety of applications, and as an example we use almost strong approximation for tori to extend the essential part of the result of Radhika and Raghunathan on the congruence subgroup problem for inner forms of type $\textsf{A}_n$ to all absolutely almost simple simply connected groups.</description>

Abstract: We study the log version of the prismatic Dieudonn\'{e} theory established by Ansch\"{u}tz-Le Bras. By applying this result to the integral toroidal compactification of a Shimura variety of Hodge type, we extend the prismatic realization, originally constructed by Imai-Kato-Youcis, to the compactification. This extension enables us to prove Lovering's conjecture on $p$-adic comparison isomorphisms for Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19343v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equilevel algebra is a subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ distinguished in this space by finitely many linear conditions of the type $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i)$, $x_i \neq \tilde x_i \in M$, or approximated by such subalgebras. For $M = S^1$ or ${\mathbb R}^1$, the regular points of the variety of all equilevel subalgebras of codimension $k$ in $C^\infty(M, {\mathbb R})$ are known in knot theory as $k$-chord diagrams. The whole of this variety completes the space of chord diagrams in the same way as the spaces of ideals of given codimensions in complete the configuration spaces. We describe cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension three in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and compute their homology rings and characteristic classes of canonical vector bundles. We also give lower estimates of these rings for arbitrary $k$.</description>

Abstract: A dormant oper is a specific type of principal bundle with a flat connection, defined on an algebraic curve in positive characteristic. The moduli spaces of dormant opers and their variants, known as dormant Miura opers, have been studied in various contexts. This paper focuses on the case where the underlying spaces are (possibly nodal) elliptic curves and provides a detailed examination of the geometric structures of their moduli spaces. In particular, we explicitly describe dormant (generic Miura) opers in terms of regular elements in an associated Lie algebra and establish the connectedness of these moduli spaces. We also explore generalizations to higher level and prime-power characteristic.</description>

Interestingly, the experimental results lead us to the conjecture that there exist exactly $[p/48]$ isomorphism classes of such curves if $p \equiv 1,7 \pmod{8}$, whereas such curves exist if $p \equiv 3,5 \pmod{8}$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an extension of previous ungraded work, we define a graded $p$-polar ring to be an analog of a graded commutative ring where multiplication is only allowed on $p$-tuples (instead of pairs) of elements of equal degree. We show that the free affine $p$-adic group scheme functor, as well as the free formal group functor, defined on $k$-algebras for a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$, factors through $p$-polar $k$-algebras. It follows that the same is true for any affine $p$-adic or formal group functor, in particular for the functor of $p$-typical Witt vectors. As an application, we show that the homology of the free $E_n$-algebra $H^*(\Omega^n\Sigma^n X;\mathbf F_p)$, as a Hopf algebra, only depends on the $p$-polar structure of $H^*(X;\mathbf F_p)$ in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Chai's conjectures on base change conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The base change conductor is an invariant introduced by Chai which measures the failure of a semiabelian variety to have semiabelian reduction. We investigate the behaviour of this invariant in short exact sequences, as well as under duality and isogeny. Our results imply Chai's conjecture on the additivity of the base change conductor in short exact sequences, while also showing that a proposed generalisation of this conjecture fails. We use similar methods to show that the base change conductor is invariant under duality of Abelian varieties in equal positive characteristic (answering a question of Chai), as well as giving a new short proof of a formula due to Chai, Yu, and de Shalit which expresses the base change conductor of a torus in terms of its (rational) cocharacter module.</description>

      <title>On the face stratification of the $m=2$ amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study the face stratification of the m=2 amplituhedron. We show that the face poset is an upper order ideal in the face poset of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. Our construction is consistent with earlier work of Lukowski, and we confirm various predictions of Lukowski.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Kulikov-Persson-Pinkham theorem via smoothing of dlt models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of the Kulikov-Persson-Pinkham Theorem for a projective degeneration of K-trivial smooth surfaces. After running the Minimal Model Program, the obtained minimal dlt model has mild singularities which we resolve via Brieskorn's simultaneous resolutions and toric resolutions.</description>
