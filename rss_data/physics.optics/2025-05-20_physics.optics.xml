      <title>Programmable metasurfaces for future photonic artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency, latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies. Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware, enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable next-generation photonic AI technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Navigation-Grade and Deployable Optomechanical Accelerometery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and experimentally demonstrate an architecture for achieving navigation-grade, fiber-packaged optomechanical accelerometers that can operate with a large dynamic range, over a wide temperature range, and without sophisticated laser sources. Our accelerometer architecture is based on a novel set of design principles that take advantage of the strengths of optomechanical accelerometry while eliminating many of its historical weaknesses. Displacement readout is provided by an integrated, differential strain-sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DSMZI) attached to an ultra-rigid, bulk-micromachined proof mass having a 93.4 kHz fundamental resonance frequency (22.5 pm/g displacement). Despite the extreme rigidity, the high displacement sensitivity provides an insertion loss limited 4.2 $\mu g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ acceleration resolution, with a straight-forward path to achieving 330 $n g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by improving the fiber-to-chip coupling. Further, we show that the combination of high rigidity and intrinsic differential optical readout makes the device insensitive to the common causes of bias instability, and we measure a bias instability of 6.3 $\mu g$ at 243 seconds. The DSMZI provides a 17 nm optical bandwidth and a temperature operating range of greater than 20 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, both orders of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations of optomechanical accelerometers. The high rigidity and large optical bandwidth yield an expected dynamic range of 165.4 dB. The combination of high acceleration resolution, high dynamic range, low bias instability, and intrinsic insensitivity to wavelength, temperature, and package stresses makes our device well suited for deployment in realistic environments demanded by real-world applications and demonstrates a path for optomechanical accelerometers to ultimately exceed the performance of all other chip-based accelerometers.</description>

      <title>A VCSEL based Photonic Neuromorphic Processor for Event-Based Imaging Flow Cytometry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an optical neuromorphic imaging and processing cytometry system that integrates an excitable VCSEL-based time-delayed (TD) extreme learning machine with an event-based 2D camera. The proposed system is designed for the classification of Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) particles of varying diameters moving at speeds between 0.01 and 0.1 m/s. The TD photonic scheme achieved a classification accuracy of 95.8% while encoding the original 2D images into a 1-bit spike stream containing a maximum of 96 spikes. Additionally, the binary representation of the synthetic frames enables a significant reduction in memory and hardware requirements, ranging from 98.4% to 99.5% and 50% to 84%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the integration of neuromorphic computing with sensing can facilitate the development of low-power, low-latency applications optimized for resource-constrained environments</description>

      <title>Laser transfer and retrieval via nanophotonic supercontinuum process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of optical metrology is to perform efficient transfer and precise retrieval for lasers and optical signals, which is beneficial for a variety of applications ranging from optical clocking, spectroscopy, to telecommunications and quantum optics. While efforts have been made to promote the detection accuracy of optical frequencies, retrieval on optical waveforms remains on the autocorrelation scheme with limited performances. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme for optical metrology, particularly on direct retrieval of optical waveform in terms of the field amplitude profile. The scheme is based on massive four-wave-mixings underlying a nanophotonic supercontinuum process, which enables arbitrary transfer of an additive laser to modulational sidebands of the broadened continuum. Detection of the transferred signals is then flexible to be within the whole span of the supercontinuum from visible to the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate such a transfer scheme for both CW lasers and pulsed lasers. For the latter, the temporal amplitude profile of the optical wave can be retrieved, which reveals high-order dynamics of solitary pulses including the self-steepening, self-compression, and the soliton splitting, and shows a remarkable square-fold increase of signal-to-noise ratio in the power spectrum. Our results may contribute to advance optical metrology particularly towards chip scale optical waveform detection, and more fundamentally, they reveal insights of massive ultrafast nonlinear interactions underlying the soliton-based supercontinuum process.</description>

      <title>Implementation of ultra-broadband optical null media via space-folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical null medium (ONM) has garnered significant attention in electromagnetic wave manipulation. However, existing ONM implementations suffer from either narrow operational bandwidths or low efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-broadband ONM design that simultaneously addresses both challenges - achieving broad bandwidth while preserving perfect impedance matching with air for near-unity transmittance. The proposed space-folding ONM is realized by introducing precisely engineered folds into a metal channel array, creating an effective dispersion-free medium that enables independent phase control in each channel. The design incorporates optimized boundary layers implemented through gradually tapered folding structures, achieving perfect impedance matching with the surrounding medium. Beam bending effect and broadband beam focusing effect are experimentally verified using the proposed space-folding ONM. Due to its simple material requirements, broadband characteristics, and high transmittance, the proposed space-folding ONM shows potential for applications in electromagnetic camouflage, beam steering devices and ultra-compact microwave components.</description>

      <title>2.7-octave supercontinuum generation spanning from ultraviolet to near-infrared in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercontinuum generation (SCG) with spectral coverage across the full visible and ultraviolet (UV) ranges is crucial for optical clocks, quantum computing and sensing. However, achieving such SCG in nanophotonic platforms is challenging due to the difficulties in spectrum broadening. Here, Such ultrabroad-bandwidth SCG was demonstrated in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides by dispersion management, without periodic poling for spectral broadening. Anomalous-dispersion waveguides were designed in the telecom band, simultaneously enabling dispersive wave emergence, modal-matched second harmonic generation, and third harmonic generation for spectrum broadening. Moreover, MgO was intentionally doped to mitigate the photorefractive effect of lithium niobate, which frequently results in un-sustained spectrum broadening and in turn limits the accessible SCG coverage. By leveraging photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching, low-loss MgO doped TFLN nanophotonic waveguides were fabricated. As a result, thanks to the utilization of the strong second-order and third-order nonlinear processes, gap-free 2.7-octave SCG spanning from 330 nm to 2250 nm was observed by pumping the waveguide with a 1550-nm femtosecond pulsed laser with 0.687 nJ, agreeing well with numerical simulation. This spectral coverage represents the state of the art in TFLN platforms without fine microdomains, and even close to the record in sophisticated chirped periodically poled TFLN waveguides.</description>

      <title>Real-time surrogate modeling of nonlinear pulse evolution in multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling nonlinear pulse propagation in multimode fibers is challenging due to the large number of interacting modes and the resulting spatiotemporal complexity. Traditional optimization methods often become intractable, while learning-based approaches, such as recurrent neural networks, suffer from high computational cost and long inference times. We present a U-Net architecture as a fast, accurate surrogate for modeling nonlinear pulse propagation in multimode fibers. This approach overcomes the intractability of traditional methods while offering low computational cost. Trained on data generated by beam propagation method, our approach achieves an $\sim$88\% average structural similarity index with simulations. The model can generalize to untrained propagation distances, demonstrating convolutional architectures as efficient tools for simulating complex spatiotemporal dynamics in multimode fibers and offering potential for applications like mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quadratic soliton mode-locking of nonlinear frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion underpins numerous classical and quantum photonics applications but conventionally relies on synchronized femtosecond mode-locked lasers and dispersion-engineered enhancement cavities - an approach that imposes substantial system complexity. Here, we report a fundamentally different paradigm: dissipative quadratic soliton (DQS) mode-locking in a continuous-wave (CW)-pumped, doubly resonant second-harmonic generation cavity. By leveraging a cascaded quadratic nonlinear process, we realize an effective Kerr nonlinearity (EKN) that exceeds the intrinsic material Kerr response by over three orders of magnitude and is tunable in both magnitude and sign via pump detuning. This engineered nonlinearity enables femtosecond DQS formation in a free-space lithium niobate cavity with normal dispersion, without dispersion engineering or synchronization electronics. Numerical simulations predict distinct dynamical regimes depending on phase detuning, and experiments confirm the spontaneous emergence of bichromatic femtosecond solitons spanning visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The observed DQSs exhibit spectral 3 dB bandwidths and transform-limited pulse durations of 1.15 THz and 274 fs for the pump and 1.13 THz and 279 fs for the second harmonic. Our results establish a versatile platform for efficient and broadband nonlinear frequency conversion and frequency comb generation based on quadratic nonlinearities, with significant implications for scalable ultrafast and nonlinear photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal SU(1,1) Interferometer with Broadband Squeezed Light Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal optics has attracted much attention due to its ability for lossless stretching of ultrafast temporal pulses. At the same time, spatial SU(1,1) interferometers have been widely used because of their high sensitivity to phase changes. On this basis, we studied a temporal SU(1,1) interferometer based on a temporal Fourier transform system and injected broadband squeezing light into the interferometer for research. The results show that the output spectral characteristics of the interferometer depend on the ratio of the focal group velocity dispersion (GDD) of the two temporal lenses (this ratio is defined as the magnification factor) and the phase derivative of the applied phase. The magnification factor significantly affects the bandwidth and squeeze degree at the center frequency of the output spectrum. The phase derivative induces a nonlinear frequency shift effect, resulting in a controllable shift in the center frequency of the output squeezed state spectrum, and the shift is linearly related to the phase derivative. This novel temporal SU(1,1) interferometer architecture opens up new avenues for the control of nonclassical fields in the time-frequency domain and quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>High-Q photonic crystal Fabry-Perot micro-resonator in thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a powerful platform for integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics, owing to its strong optical nonlinearities, wide transparency window, and electro- and piezo-optic properties. However, conventional traveling-wave resonators, such as micro-rings, disks, and racetracks, suffer from curvature-dependent group dispersion and losses, limited spectral tunability, and parasitic nonlinearities, which constrain their performance, scalability, and operational stability in nonlinear photonic circuits. Here, we present photonic crystal (PhC) Fabry-Perot (FP) micro-resonators in TFLN that address these limitations. The device features a one-dimensional straight cavity bounded by PhC reflectors and supports well-confined standing-wave resonant modes within an engineered photonic bandgap. We achieve intrinsic quality (Q) factors of up to 1.4e6 and demonstrate that both the free spectral range (FSR) and coupling strength can be consistently controlled via cavity length and PhC coupler design, respectively. The photonic bandgap is tunable across the S-, C-, and L-bands without degradation of resonator performance. Spectral confinement of high-Q resonant modes is expected to mitigate parasitic nonlinearities, such as Raman scattering. These advances, together with the one-dimensional geometry, establish PhC FP micro-resonators as compact and scalable building blocks for high-density photonic integrated circuits targeting next-generation nonlinear and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Ghost Imaging with a Tabletop XUV Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel lensless imaging approach in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range, utilizing ghost imaging techniques and a compact tabletop high-harmonic generation source. By eliminating conventional lenses and optics, this method enables high-resolution, low-dose imaging while reducing the complexity and cost associated with large-scale facilities. We evaluated the performance of various illumination patterns, including random, Hadamard, and Fourier patterns, in combination with different reconstruction algorithms such as traditional ghost imaging and compressive sensing. Our findings indicate that structured Hadamard patterns, coupled with compressive sensing algorithms, produce high-quality images, allowing for the reconstruction of detailed microscopic features. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of experimental factors such as sample quality, pattern alignment, and noise reduction techniques on image fidelity. This research highlights the potential of lensless tabletop extreme ultraviolet ghost imaging for high-resolution, low-dose applications in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Sample-and Back-Focal-Plane (BFP) Imaging. Pt. I: Instrument and acquisition parameters affecting BFP images and their analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The back-focal plane (BFP) of a high-numerical aperture objective contains the fluoro-phore radiation pattern, which encodes information about the axial fluorophore position, molecular orientation and the local refractive index of the embedding medium. BFP image acquisition and analysis are common to conoscopy, k-space imaging, supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) and single-molecule detection, but they are rarely being used in biological fluorescence. This work addresses a critical gap in quantitative microscopy by enabling reliable, real-time BFP imaging under low-light conditions and/or short exposure times, typical of biological experiments. By systematically analyzing how key parameters - such as Bertrand lens position, defocus, pixel size, and binning - affect BFP image quality and SAF/UAF ratios, we provide a robust framework for accurate axial fluorophore localization and near-membrane refractive-index measurements. The described hardware- and software integration allows for multi-dimensional image-series and online quality control, reducing experimental error and enhancing reproducibility. Our contributions lay the foundation for standardized BFP imaging across laboratories, expanding its application to dynamic biological systems, and opening the door to machine learning-based analysis pipelines. Ultimately, this work transforms BFP imaging from an expert-dependent technique into a reproducible and scalable tool for surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Electron Temperature Dynamics in Spintronic Terahertz Emitters on Picosecond Timescale Using Optical-Pump Terahertz-Probe Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) pumped by femtosecond lasers offer an increasingly popular approach to generate broadband terahertz radiation. The strength of the emitted terahertz field is limited in part by the STEs optical damage threshold at the pump wavelength. Their thermal management can be improved by better understanding the electron temperature relaxation in the spintronic metal layer. Here we present a measurement of the electron temperature dynamics on a picosecond timescale using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical pump induces a change in the terahertz transmissivity of the STE. This approach has an advantage over other methods, because it avoids the possibility of further heating of the sample by the probe pulse. This is especially significant for measurements of accumulative heat effects, which can dominate the optical damage mechanism when the STE is pumped at a MHz repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Calibration-free single-frame super-resolution fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous Self And Base Station Positioning via Resonant beam for Extensible System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision positioning in GPS-denied environments is a demanding but challenging technology. Resonant Beam Positioning (RBP) utilizes a resonant beam with properties such as energy focusing, self-establishment, self-alignment, and passive operation, offering a promising solution for this task. However, traditional RBP algorithms require a fixed number of resonant beam base stations, which can be costly to expand to increase coverage. To address this limitation, we propose a distributed resonant beam positioning (DRBP) system that simultaneously estimates the base station and mobile target (MT) positions. The MT receives resonant beam samples to locate the base station in this system. Subsequently, it estimates self-position based on the known locations of the base stations. The DRBP system facilitates self-positioning on the MT side, enabling dynamic expansion of both the number of base stations and the coverage area. Numerical results demonstrate that DRBP achieves a positioning root mean square error (RMSE) of $0.1$ m and a rotation RMSE of 2$^\circ$, validating the system's high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Silicon Nitride Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride photonics has enabled integration of a variety of components for applications in linear and nonlinear optics, including telecommunications, optical clocks, astrocombs, bio-sensing, and LiDAR. With the advent of inverse design - where desired device performance is specified and closely achieved through iterative, gradient-based optimization - and the increasing availability of silicon nitride photonics via foundries, it is now feasible to expand the photonic design library beyond the limits of traditional approaches and unlock new functionalities. In this work, we present inverse-designed photonics on a silicon nitride platform and demonstrate both the design capabilities and experimental validation of manipulating light in wavelength and spatial mode dimensions to high-Q resonators with controllable wavelength range and dispersion. Furthermore, we use these inverse-designed structures to form optical cavities that hold promise for on-chip nonlinear and quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and optimization of deep learning models for enhanced detection of brain cancer using transmission optical microscopy of thin brain tissue samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical transmission spectroscopy is one method to understand brain tissue structural properties from brain tissue biopsy samples, yet manual interpretation is resource intensive and prone to inter observer variability. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer automated feature learning directly from raw brightfield images. Here, we evaluate ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on a curated dataset of 2,931 bright-field transmission optical microscopy images of thin brain tissue, split into 1,996 for training, 437 for validation, and 498 for testing. Our two stage transfer learning protocol involves initial training of a classifier head on frozen pretrained feature extractors, followed by fine tuning of deeper convolutional blocks with extensive data augmentation (rotations, flips, intensity jitter) and early stopping. DenseNet121 achieves 88.35 percent test accuracy, 0.9614 precision, 0.8667 recall, and 0.9116 F1 score the best performance compared to ResNet50 (82.12 percent, 0.9035, 0.8142, 0.8563). Detailed analysis of confusion matrices, training and validation curves, and classwise prediction distributions illustrates robust convergence and minimal bias. These findings demonstrate the superior generalization of dense connectivity on limited medical datasets and outline future directions for multi-class tumor grading and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping and skin solitons in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-Hermitian photonics, we systematically investigate the spectral and dynamical aspects of two-dimensional nonlinear Hatano-Nelson lattices. In particular, we examine the interplay between self-trapping, due to nonlinearity, and propagation due to the non-Hermitian skin effect. These antagonistic effects give rise to amplitude thresholds - above which self-trapping in a single-channel dominates - that depend highly on the position of initial excitation and the degree of coupling asymmetry. Additionally, we identify two-dimensional skin soliton solutions and characterize their power thresholds and spatial profiles.</description>

      <title>Broadband Terahertz Frequency Comb Based on Actively Mode Locked Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency combs characterized by their phase-coherent equidistant spectral modes and precise frequency scales of broadband spectrum, have made them an indispensable part of contemporary physics. A terahertz (THz) frequency comb is a key asset for THz technology applications in spectroscopy, metrology, communications, and sensing. However, the THz frequency comb technologies are comparatively underdeveloped compared to the optical frequency domain, primarily attributed to the deficiency of advanced THz generation components. In this paper, we innovatively demonstrate a compact THz frequency comb source based on a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) through active mode locking technique. By injecting a strong continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal via the bias line into a RTD oscillator integrated within a WR-5 hollow metallic waveguide package, we observe a broadband comb spectrum spanning from 140 to 325 GHz. The mode spacing is directly determined by the frequency of the injected RF signal, providing a wide tuning range of approximately 40 GHz. We also employ the proposed frequency comb source as the local oscillator in a coherent transmitter. In particular, this is the first all-electrical compact THz frequency comb source, and the transmission demonstration paves the way to next-generation communication.</description>

      <title>Efficient training for large-scale optical neural network using an evolutionary strategy and attention pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MZI-based block optical neural networks (BONNs), which can achieve large-scale network models, have increasingly drawn attentions. However, the robustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough. Moreover, large-scale BONNs usually contain numerous trainable parameters, resulting in expensive computation and power consumption. In this article, by pruning matrix blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327% for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5) exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover, when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5% accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Coupled integral equations method with open boundary conditions for calculation the characteristics of structured waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of modification of the CASCIE code aimed at implementing open boundary conditions are presented. The accelerator section developed at CERN was chosen as a prototype for the structured waveguide under testing. Results of testing the CASCIE-M code confirms that the implementation of matrix open boundary conditions gives possibility to consider the structure in which waves enter and exit without additional reflections from couplers. It was shown that the dependence of the reflection coefficient on frequency differs from the similar dependence for a waveguide with couplers. It does not have a regular sequence of minimum and maximum values associated with reflections from the couplers and the formation of resonance conditions. This indicates that the reflections are of a different nature and are associated with inhomogeneity. The proposed modification of the coupled integral equation method allows us to investigate the accuracy of the field expansion on which coupled mode theory can be constructed that describes structured waveguides.</description>

      <title>Exponential enhancement of sensitivity in Ramsey interferometry with optically thick ensemble of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramsey interferometry is a cornerstone technique for precise measurement of time and frequency in modern clocks. The Ramsey experiments are typically done in optically dilute samples of atoms to improve homogeneity and avoid back-action of atoms on excitation pulses. In contrast to later belief, we predict and experimentally show that in optically thick samples with inhomogeneous broadening of resonant transition, the back-action can lead to the highly enhanced narrowing of Ramsey resonance. The linewidth narrowing and corresponding precision of the frequency measurement scale exponentially with an increase in optical depth of a sample and can reach the limits set by homogeneous broadening. We show that this effect is caused by a nonlinear interference of multiple echoes formed inside the atomic medium, which is experimentally confirmed with $^{167}\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions in $\text{Y}_2\text{SiO}_5$ crystal. Our findings open new opportunities for nonlinear high-resolution spectroscopy of resonant media and sensitivity enhancement in a new generation of solid state clocks.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate resonance of first-order vector vortex beams (VVB) with a triangular optical cavity. We also show that, due to their symmetry properties, the VVBs commonly known as radial and azimuthal beams do not resonate at the same cavity length, which could be explored to use the triangular resonator as a mode sorter. In addition, an intracavity Pancharatnam phase shifter (PPS) is implemented in order to compensate for any birefringent phase that the cavity mirrors may introduce.</description>

      <title>Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 $\mu$m thick, and a resolution of 1 $\mu$m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 $\mu$m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at ${\texttt VectorPSFs.jl}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting optical rotation in helically-coiled fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpretation of optical rotation in optically active media as circular birefringence has persisted for over two centuries, yet the inherent fallacy in this phenomenological theory remains unnoticed. Recently, we employed logical reasoning to demonstrate that isotropic chiral media, a kind of optically active media, do not exhibit circular birefringence. This finding implies that the Jones vector is not able to completely describe the polarization state of a plane light wave. To further explore the reason, here we revisit the phenomenon of optical rotation in helically-coiled optical fibers.
  Firstly, we use similar logical reasoning to prove that helically coiled fibers do not exhibit circular birefringence, either. Secondly, based on the experimental observations of Papp and Harms, we argue that the Jones vector is mathematically an entity in the local reference frame associated with the propagation direction. It cannot completely describe the state of polarization relative to the laboratory reference frame. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the rotation observed by Papp and Harms reflects the rotation of the Tang frame relative to the Serret-Frenet frame.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of vortex and pseudovortex beams with a triangular optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A triangular optical cavity can be used to distinguish between two beams with the same intensity profile but different wavefronts. This is what we show in this paper, both theoretically and experimentally, in the case of beams with a doughnut-like intensity profile: one of them having a helical wavefront (vortex beam with orbital angular momentum) and the other with no orbital angular momentum at all (which we call pseudovortex beam). We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that each beam exhibits a distinct resonance pattern. This suggests that such a cavity can be used to identify beams carrying orbital angular momentum, effectively distinguishing them from pseudovortices. Moreover, we propose an experiment where three cavities may be used to filter out the pseudovortex from a superposition of vortex and pseudovortex.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Chain: A Simple Model for Universal Description of Excitation of Waveguiding Modes in Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no simple and universal analytical description of various micro-optical systems related with Fano resonances. This especially concern modulated thin films, which, when coupled to external fields, show Fano resonances. Usually, such micro-optic circuits are simulated numerically, frequently by the use of commercial software. We fill this gap of the lack of universal analytical description by introducing and exploring a simple mechanical equivalent, the oscillator chain, which mimic such schemes involving Fano resonances. The model does not necessary provide the rigorous description of complicated micro-optical schemes, however does capture the main properties of such Fano-related micro-optical systems. The model captures different modifications of the thin film arrangement as well: thin film with amplification, non-Hermitical thin films, and others. It also covers the case of multiple Fano resonances in a thin film. The model is compared with the rigorously calculated (Rigorous Coupled Wave analysis) wave propagation in the thin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</description>

      <title>Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of these thin films, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent their dielectric functions and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit the oscillator parameters by minimizing the error between the measured and simulated FTIR spectra. We performed Monte Carlo simulations in the optimization routine to estimate error ranges in the extracted refractive indices resulting from multiple sources of measurement uncertainty. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive indices extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. We validated the applicability of the extracted mid-infrared refractive indices of NbN and MoSi at temperatures below their critical temperatures by comparing them with the Mattis-Bardeen model. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GaN defect-based quantum emitters show significant potential for quantum information technologies, yet their intrinsic nature is not fully understood. In this work, we present results on the temperature-dependent emission polarization of GaN defect single-photon emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses. The photoluminescence (PL) remains linearly polarized over the temperature range of 10K to 300K, with a slight rotation in the polarization direction observed at intermediate temperatures. Possible mechanisms underlying this behavior are analyzed, and a roadmap for future research is outlined.</description>

      <title>Petahertz-bandwidth spectral combs from the amplified spontaneous emission of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of generating spectral combs of petahertz bandwidth is demonstrated from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser when its active medium is irradiated with a linearly polarized near-infrared (IR) laser field. It is shown that at a sufficiently high IR-field intensity these combs correspond to a sequence of subfemtosecond beats of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation of a deterministic shape. At the same time, at a lower IR-field intensity ASE remains quasimonochromatic, but its frequency shifts as a result of the IR-field-induced quadratic Stark effect. In this case, the frequency tuning range of XUV radiation is approximately twice the frequency of the modulating IR field. In addition, modulation by the IR field leads to amplitude and frequency discrimination of the polarization components of ASE, parallel and orthogonal to the IR field. The possibility of observing these effects is analyzed for a collisional plasma x-ray laser based on neon-like Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed ASE wavelength of 32.6 nm and a modulating field with a wavelength of 1 {\mu}m and an intensity in the range of 10^16 - 10^17 W/cm^2.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Sb$_2$S$_3$ Optical Phase Shifter Enabled by Optimizing Sputtering Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By quantitatively evaluating the atomic concentrations of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ films with different sputtering powers and Ar flows, we reveal that a sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ film becomes close to the stoichiometric composition as the sputtering power and Ar flow decrease. We characterize the optical properties of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and show that the lower sputtering power leads to a better figure of merit of Sb$_2$S$_3$ as an optical phase shifter in the near infrared (NIR) range. Based on these results, we achieve a loss per phase shift of 0.33 dB/$\pi$ at a wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m, one of the lowest losses among Sb$_2$S$_3$ phase shifters in the NIR range.</description>

      <title>Compact, Large-Scale Photonic Neurons by Modulation-and-Weight Microring Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication imperfections, spatial constraints, and prohibitive costs collectively impede the scalability of neuromorphic photonics. In this work, we introduce a large-scale, compact photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously. This dual functionality is realized by leveraging both the carrier effect and thermal tunability, thereby merging modulation and weighting to conserve on-chip area, enhancing tuning efficiency, and capitalizing on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) for scalable implementations. In addition, we investigated a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. To illustrate the adaptability of the system's tasks, we explore both spatial and temporal domains, highlighting its versatility through two representative tasks: image processing and, for the first time, financial time series analysis, which represents a promising new frontier for neuromorphic photonics. These findings underscore the considerable promise of photonic computing in addressing a breadth of real-world challenges, particularly under escalating demands for both scalability and flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about a landscape is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. A common assumption is that the landscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation pressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum optomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an eye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially multimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the limit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with high-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of correlated biphotons through transparent samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon states generated through degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit sharp correlations in the transverse spatial coordinates. This property leads to unique free-space propagation features. Here, we show that a phase object placed in the image plane of the source affects the free space propagation of the SPDC in a way that is mathematically analogous to the Fresnel diffraction of a first-order coherent source. This effect can be observed via the extraction of correlation images. We demonstrate this prediction with an experiment where the diffraction of correlated bi-photons is detected using an event-based camera. The results allow us to reconstruct the phase structure of the sample via non-interferometric phase retrieval methods. We verify that the retrieved phase patterns exhibit an enhanced contrast due to the probe two-photon nature. Our findings offer applications for non-interferometric, quantum-enhanced phase imaging.</description>

      <title>Light-controlled strong coupling of optical cavity modes spaced by 200 THz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavities have driven significant advances in optical physics and quantum science, with applications ranging from lasers and spectroscopy to quantum information processing, simulation and metrology. For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $&gt;$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \(\rho = 0\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \(\rho\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\(m\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \(m\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \(m \neq 0\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Sequential Tensor Properties Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical spectra serve as a powerful tool for probing the interactions between materials and light, unveiling complex electronic structures such as flat bands and nontrivial topological features. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of photonic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where understanding the electronic structure directly impacts device performance. Moreover, in anisotropic bulk materials, the optical responses are direction-dependent, and predicting those response tensors still remains computationally demanding due to its inherent complexity and the constraint from crystal symmetry. To address this challenge, we introduce the sequential tensorial properties equivariant neural network (StepENN), a graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full optical tensors across different photon frequencies. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components and anisotropic sequential tensor components into l=0 and l=2 spherical tensor components, StepENN ensures symmetry-aware sequential tensor predictions that are consistent with the inherent symmetry constraints of crystal systems. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors for 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed from first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24.216 millifarads per meter (mF/m) on the predicted tensorial spectra with 85.7% of its predictions exhibiting less than 10% relative error, demonstrating its potential for deriving other spectrum-related properties, such as optical conductivity. This framework opens new avenues for the data-driven design of materials with engineered anisotropic optical responses, accelerating material advances in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>
