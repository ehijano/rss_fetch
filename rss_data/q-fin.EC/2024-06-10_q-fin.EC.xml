      <title>Early School Leaving in Spain: a longitudinal analysis by gender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spain is one of the eight EU-27 countries that failed to reduce early school leaving (ESL) below 10% in 2020, and now faces the challenge of achieving a rate below 9% by 2030. The determinants of this phenomenon are usually studied using cross-sectional data at the micro-level and without differentiation by gender. In this study, we analyse it for the first time for Spain using panel data (between 2002-2020), taking into account the high regional inequalities at the macroeconomic level and the masculinisation of the phenomenon. The results show a positive relationship between ESL and socioeconomic variables such as the adolescent fertility rate, immigration, unemployment or the weight of the industrial and construction sectors in the regional economy, with significant gender differences that invite us to discuss educational policies. Surprisingly, youth unemployment has only small but significant impact on female ESL.</description>

      <title>Differential Test Performance and Peer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use variation of test scores measuring closely related skills to isolate peer effects. The intuition for our identification strategy is that the difference in closely related scores eliminates factors common to the performance in either test while retaining idiosyncratic test specific variation. Common factors include unobserved teacher and group effects as well as test invariant ability and factors relevant for peer group formation. Peer effects work through idiosyncratic shocks which have the interpretation of individual and test specific ability or effort. We use education production functions as well as restrictions on the information content of unobserved test taking ability to formalize our approach. An important implication of our identifying assumptions is that we do not need to rely on randomized group assignment. We show that our model restrictions are sufficient for the formulation of linear and quadratic moment conditions that identify the peer effects parameter of interest. We use Project STAR data to empirically measure peer effects in kindergarten through third grade classes. We find evidence of highly significant peer effects with magnitudes that are at the lower end of the range of estimates found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Human Learning about AI Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do humans assess the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across different tasks? AI has been noted for its surprising ability to accomplish very complex tasks while failing seemingly trivial ones. We show that humans engage in ``performance anthropomorphism'' when assessing AI capabilities: they project onto AI the ability model that they use to assess humans. In this model, observing an agent fail an easy task is highly diagnostic of a low ability, making them unlikely to succeed at any harder task. Conversely, a success on a hard task makes successes on any easier task likely. We experimentally show that humans project this model onto AI. Both prior beliefs and belief updating about AI performance on standardized math questions appear consistent with the human ability model. This contrasts with actual AI performance, which is uncorrelated with human difficulty in our context, and makes such beliefs misspecified. Embedding our framework into an adoption model, we show that patterns of under- and over-adoption can be sustained in an equilibrium with anthropomorphic beliefs.</description>

      <title>China's Rising Leadership in Global Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major shifts in the global system of science and technology are destabilizing the global status order and demonstrating the capacity for emerging countries like China and India to exert greater influence. In order to measure changes in the global scientific system, we develop a framework to assess the hierarchical position of countries in the international scientific collaboration network. Using a machine-learning model to identify the leaders of 5,966,623 scientific teams that collaborated across international borders, we show that Chinese scientists substantially narrowed their leadership deficit with scientists from the US, UK, and EU between 1990 and 2023 in absolute terms. Consequently, China and the US are on track to reach an equal number of team leaders engaged in bilateral collaborations between 2027 and 2028. Nevertheless, Chinese progress has been considerably slower in per-collaborator terms: after adjusting for the number of non-leaders from each country, our models do not predict parity between the US and China until after 2087. These dynamics extend to 11 critical technology areas central to ongoing diplomacy between the two nations, such AI, Semiconductors, and Advanced Communications, and to China's scientific leadership with respect to the European Union and the United Kingdom. Thus, while China's elite scientists are achieving leadership in the international scientific community, China's scientific enterprise continues to face developmental constraints. We conclude by reviewing several steps that Chinese science is taking to overcome these constraints, by increasing its engagement in scientific training and research in signatory nations to the Belt and Road Initiative.</description>

      <title>To Determine the Desired Purchase Preference of the Consumers Among Various Electric, Internal Combustion Engine and Hybrid Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming popular as a viable means of transportation for the future. The use of EVs may help to provide better climatic conditions in urban areas with a pocket friendly cost for transportation to the consumers throughout its life. EVs enact as a boon to the society by providing zero tailpipe emissions, better comfort, low lifecycle cost and higher connectivity. The article aims to provide scientific information through the literature across various aspects of EVs in their lifetime and thus, assist the scholarly community and various organisations to understand the impact of EVs. In this study we have gathered information from the articles published in SCOPUS database and through grey literature with the focus of information post 2009. After identification of various factors while purchasing the vehicle, the total cost of ownership (TCO) for vehicles is calculated and their average TCO for each segment is considered for the study. Following that, we investigate the ranking of EVs, vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in a variety of price segments by employing the Best-Worst Method (BWM). Additionally, we develop a hybrid methodology that utilizes BWM in conjunction with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The study has helped us to conclude that EVs should be preferred over ICEVs and HEV by the users.</description>

      <title>A 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage: nothing crazy!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first empirical evidence on the 22 percent increase in the German minimum wage, implemented in 2022, raising it from Euro 9.82 to 10.45 in July and to Euro 12 in October. Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large and novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations reported by employers each month, we apply a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact on hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings reveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended benefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on working hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an implied labor demand elasticity in terms of the employment volume of -0.17 which only partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative effect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment levels.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>
