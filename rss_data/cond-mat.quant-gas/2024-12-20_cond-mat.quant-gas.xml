      <title>Ground State Phases and Topological Excitations of Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensate in Twisted Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the simulation of moir\'e physics using cold atom platforms has gained significant attention. These platforms provide an opportunity to explore novel aspects of moir\'e physics that go beyond the limits of traditional condensed matter systems. Building on recent experimental advancements in creating twisted bilayer spin-dependent optical lattices for pseudospin-1/2 Bose gases, we extend this concept to a trilayer optical lattice for spin-1 Bose gases. Unlike conventional moir\'e patterns, which are typically induced by interlayer tunneling or interspin coupling, the moir\'e pattern in this trilayer system arises from inter-species atomic interactions. We investigate the ground state of Bose-Einstein condensates loaded in this spin-1 twisted optical lattice under both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. We find that the ground state forms a periodic pattern of distinct phases in the homogeneous case, including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, polar, and broken axial symmetry phases. Additionally, by quenching the optical lattice potential strength, we examine the quench dynamics of the system above the ground state and observe the emergence of topological excitations such as vortex pairs. This study provides a pathway for exploring the rich physics of spin-1 twisted optical lattices and expands our understanding of moir\'e systems in synthetic quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Landau level structure in dark optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluid dimers of hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</description>

      <title>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Phase Transition in the Two-Photon Dicke Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>When does a Fermi puddle become a Fermi sea? Emergence of pairing in two-dimensional trapped mesoscopic Fermi gases</title>

Abstract: Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of light-matter interactions in degenerate plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, Hydrodynamics and Emergent Cosmology: A Collection of Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>
