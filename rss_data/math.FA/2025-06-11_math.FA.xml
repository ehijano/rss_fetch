      <title>Position of $L(X, Y)$ in $Lip_0(X, Y)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $L(X,Y)$ is complemented in $Lip_0(X, Y)$ (via a norm-one projection) provided that $Y$ is a dual space. Next, we introduce a vector-valued Lipschitz-free space $F_Y(X)$, a linear contraction $\beta_X^Y: F_Y(X) \to Y$ and prove that the quotient space ${Lip_{0}(X, Y)}/{L(X, Y) }$ is isometrically isomorphic to $L(\ker(\beta_X^Y), Y)$ whenever $Y$ is injective. We also consider a $Y$-valued duality pairing between $Lip_0(X, Y)$ and $F_Y(X)$ and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a Lipschitz map to be linear. As an application, we describe $\ker(\beta_{\mathbb{R}}^{\mathbb{R}})$ as the pre-dual of the quotient space $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})/\tilde{\mathbb{R}}$ where $\tilde{\mathbb{R}}$ is the set of all constant maps on $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Maps: Approximations and Completely Positive Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Hermitian linear maps, focusing on their decomposition into completely positive (CP) maps and their extensions to CP maps using auxiliary spaces. We derive a precise lower bound on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the negative component in any CP decomposition, proving its attainability through the Jordan decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate that the positive part of this decomposition provides the optimal CP approximation in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We also determine the minimal dimension of an auxiliary space required to extend a Hermitian map to a CP map, with explicit constructions provided. Practical examples illustrate the application of our results.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz free $p$-spaces for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ in the light of the Schur $p$-property and the compact reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric analysis of non-locally convex quasi-Banach spaces presents rich and nuanced challenges. In this paper, we introduce the Schur $p$-property and the strong Schur $p$-property for $0 &lt; p \leq 1$, providing new tools to deepen the understanding of these spaces, and the Lipschitz free $p$-spaces in particular. Moreover, by developing an adapted version of the compact reduction principle, we prove that Lipschitz free $p$-spaces over discrete metric spaces possess the approximation property, thereby answering positively a question raised by Albiac et al. in arXiv:2005.06555v2.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fields of Hilbert Spaces, Hermitian bundles and Riemannian Direct Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a field of Hilbert spaces there are two ways to endow it with a smooth structure: the standard and geometrical notion of Hilbert (or Hermitian) bundle and the analytical notion of smooth field of Hilbert spaces. We study the relationship between these concepts in a general framework. We apply our results in the following interesting example called Riemannian direct images: Let $M,N$ be Riemannian oriented manifolds, $\rho:M\to N$ be a submersion and $\pi:E\to M$ a finite dimensional vector bundle. Also, let $M_\lambda=\rho^{-1}(\lambda)$ and fix a suitable measure $\mu_\lambda$ in $M_\lambda$. Does the field of Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}(\lambda)=L^2(M_\lambda,E)$ admits a smooth field of Hilbert space structure? or a Hilbert bundle structure? In order to provide conditions to guarantee a positive answer for these questions, we develop an interesting formula to derivate functions defined on $N$ as a integral over $M_\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Unbounded order convergence on infinitely distributive lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study uO convergence on infinitely distributive lattices, extending key properties known from Riesz spaces. We show that order continuity of uO convergence characterizes infinite distributivity. We examine O-adherence and uO adherence of sublattices and ideals, proving that the uO and O closures of a sublattice coincide and form a sublattice, and that the first uO adherence of an ideal is an O closed ideal. We also analyze the Dedekind MacNeille completion of a sublattice Y within that of a lattice L, identifying conditions (A) and (B) under which the completion of Y embeds regularly in that of L. In this case, we show that the first uO adherence of Y covers its O closure.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Periodic Points of the Intersection Body Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection body $IK$ of a star-body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$, $I^2 K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Lipschitz Selections of Set-Valued Mappings in ${\bf R}^2$: long version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a set-valued mapping from an $N$-element metric space $({\mathcal M},\rho)$ into the family of all closed half-planes in ${\bf R}^2$. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm for a Lipschitz selection of $F$, i.e., a Lipschitz mapping $f:{\mathcal M}\to{\bf R}^2$ such that $f(x)\in F(x)$ for all $x\in{\mathcal M}$.
  Given a constant $\lambda&gt;0$, this algorithm produces the following two outcomes: (1) The algorithm guarantees that there is no Lipschitz selection of $F$ with Lipschitz constant at most $\lambda$; (2) The algorithm returns a Lipschitz selection of $F$ with Lipschitz constant at most $3\lambda$.
  The total work and storage required by this selection algorithm are at most $CN^2$ where $C$ is an absolute constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider countable families of vectors in a separable Hilbert space, which are mutually localized with respect to a fixed localized Riesz basis. We prove the equivalence of the frame property and nine conditions that do not involve any inequalities. This is done by studying the properties of their frame-related operators on the co-orbit spaces generated by the reference Riesz basis. We apply our main result to the setting of shift-invariant spaces and obtain new conditions for stable sets of sampling.</description>

Abstract: Fusion frames are extensively studied due to their effectiveness in recovering signals from large-scale data. They are applicable in distributed processing, wireless sensor networks, and packet encoding systems due to their robustness and redundancy. Motivated by the foundational work of Bemrose et al.\cite{Be16} and Balan\cite{Ba13}, this paper investigates the theoretical properties and characterizations of phase retrievable weaving fusion frames. These frames offer enhanced redundancy and stability in signal reconstruction. We present key results that deepen the understanding of their structure and behaviour. Lastly, an application involving probabilistic erasure is explored to demonstrate their practical utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal r\^{o}le in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heisenberg modules over noncommutative tori may also be viewed as Gabor frames. Building on this fact, we relate to deformations of noncommutative tori a bundle of Banach spaces induced by Heisenberg modules. The construction of this bundle of Banach spaces rests on deformation results of Gabor frames with windows in Feichtinger's algebra due to Feichtinger and Kaiblinger. We extend some of these results to Heisenberg modules, \eg we establish an analog of the results by Feichtinger-Kaiblinger and a Balian-Low theorem. Finally, we extend our results to several generators on the bundle of Heisenberg modules and show that they provide a generalized Fell's condition on the bundle of noncommutative tori.</description>

Abstract: We present a global pseudodifferential calculus on asymptotically conic manifolds that generalizes (anisotropic versions of) Shubin's classical global pseudodifferential calculus on Euclidean space to this class of noncompact manifolds. Fully elliptic operators are shown to be Fredholm in an associated scale of Sobolev spaces, and to have parametrices in the calculus.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  The major novelty of this paper is the discovery of putting the fine analysis of Fourier decay for multiplicative chaos measures into the theory of vector-valued martingales. This new viewpoint is of fundamental importance in the study of Fourier decay of multiplicative chaos measures. Indeed, in the sequel to this paper, combining the vector-valued martingale methods and ideas from Littlewood-Paley theory, the precise Fourier dimensions will be established for various classical models of multiplicative chaos measures including GMC of all dimensions, microcanonical Mandelbrot cascades, Mandelbrot random coverings, as well as Fourier-Walsh analysis of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to \infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In 1971 Taylor characterised all complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$ that are invertible with respect to convolution as those which can be written in the form $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma^{\ast m} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma\in \mathbb{R}$, some complex measure $\nu$, some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ and a given fixed invertible finite signed measure $\sigma$ (which has characteristic function $\mathbb{R} \ni z \mapsto (1+i z)/(1-i z)$). We extend Taylor's result to complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Somewhat surprisingly, the structure of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is not much more complicated than that of complex measures on $\mathbb{R}$, in the sense that they can be represented as $\delta_\gamma \ast \sigma_1^{\ast m_1} \ast \ldots \ast \sigma_p^{\ast m_p} \ast \exp(\nu)$ for some $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n$, some complex measure $\nu$ and $m_1,\ldots, m_p\in \mathbb{Z}$, where the $\sigma_i$ correspond to $\sigma$ in the one-dimensional case and actually live on $1$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our proof relies on a general result of Taylor for invertible complex measures on locally compact abelian groups. To apply Taylor's result, we extend some existing results for $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions to functions with values in a semisimple commutative unital Banach algebra with connected Gelfand space. The study of invertible complex measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has some impact on the theory of quasi-infinitely divisible probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>
