      <title>A Distance Similarity-based Genetic Optimization Algorithm for Satellite Ground Network Planning Considering Feeding Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the satellite industry, the information transmission network based on communication satellites has gradually become a major and important part of the future satellite ground integration network. However, the low transmission efficiency of the satellite data relay back mission has become a problem that is currently constraining the construction of the system and needs to be solved urgently. Effectively planning the task of satellite ground networking by reasonably scheduling resources is crucial for the efficient transmission of task data. In this paper, we hope to provide a task execution scheme that maximizes the profit of the networking task for satellite ground network planning considering feeding mode (SGNPFM). To solve the SGNPFM problem, a mixed-integer planning model with the objective of maximizing the gain of the link-building task is constructed, which considers various constraints of the satellite in the feed-switching mode. Based on the problem characteristics, we propose a distance similarity-based genetic optimization algorithm (DSGA), which considers the state characteristics between the tasks and introduces a weighted Euclidean distance method to determine the similarity between the tasks. To obtain more high-quality solutions, different similarity evaluation methods are designed to assist the algorithm in intelligently screening individuals. The DSGA also uses an adaptive crossover strategy based on similarity mechanism, which guides the algorithm to achieve efficient population search. In addition, a task scheduling algorithm considering the feed-switching mode is designed for decoding the algorithm to generate a high-quality scheme. The results of simulation experiments show that the DSGA can effectively solve the SGNPFM problem.</description>

      <title>Spiking Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gaining attention for their ultra-low energy consumption and high biological plausibility compared with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite their distinguished properties, the application of SNNs in the computationally intensive field of image generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose the Spiking Diffusion Models (SDMs), an innovative family of SNN-based generative models that excel in producing high-quality samples with significantly reduced energy consumption. In particular, we propose a Temporal-wise Spiking Mechanism (TSM) that allows SNNs to capture more temporal features from a bio-plasticity perspective. In addition, we propose a threshold-guided strategy that can further improve the performances by up to 16.7% without any additional training. We also make the first attempt to use the ANN-SNN approach for SNN-based generation tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal that our approach not only exhibits comparable performance to its ANN counterpart with few spiking time steps, but also outperforms previous SNN-based generative models by a large margin. Moreover, we also demonstrate the high-quality generation ability of SDM on large-scale datasets, e.g., LSUN bedroom. This development marks a pivotal advancement in the capabilities of SNN-based generation, paving the way for future research avenues to realize low-energy and low-latency generative applications.

      <title>Maelstrom Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks has struggled to devise a way to incorporate working memory into neural networks. While the ``long term'' memory can be seen as the learned weights, the working memory consists likely more of dynamical activity, that is missing from feed-forward models. Current state of the art models such as transformers tend to ``solve'' this by ignoring working memory entirely and simply process the sequence as an entire piece of data; however this means the network cannot process the sequence in an online fashion, and leads to an immense explosion in memory requirements. Here, inspired by a combination of controls, reservoir computing, deep learning, and recurrent neural networks, we offer an alternative paradigm that combines the strength of recurrent networks, with the pattern matching capability of feed-forward neural networks, which we call the \textit{Maelstrom Networks} paradigm. This paradigm leaves the recurrent component - the \textit{Maelstrom} - unlearned, and offloads the learning to a powerful feed-forward network. This allows the network to leverage the strength of feed-forward training without unrolling the network, and allows for the memory to be implemented in new neuromorphic hardware. It endows a neural network with a sequential memory that takes advantage of the inductive bias that data is organized causally in the temporal domain, and imbues the network with a state that represents the agent's ``self'', moving through the environment. This could also lead the way to continual learning, with the network modularized and ``'protected'' from overwrites that come with new data. In addition to aiding in solving these performance problems that plague current non-temporal deep networks, this also could finally lead towards endowing artificial networks with a sense of ``self''.</description>

      <title>Coalitions of AI-based Methods Predict 15-Year Risks of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Real-World Clinical Data with AUC up to 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16256</link>

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the two cancers responsible for the most deaths in women, with about 42,000 deaths each year in the US. That there are over 300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction of the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly curative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to metastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the vast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value for 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are exposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these adjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there is a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who are likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a plethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to detect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often un-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would use large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological parameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein, we report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks to develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using only extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical management as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.</description>

      <title>ART: Actually Robust Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current interest in deep learning captures the attention of many programmers and researchers. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified schema for developing deep learning models results in methodological inconsistencies, unclear documentation, and problems with reproducibility. Some guidelines have been proposed, yet currently, they lack practical implementations. Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines. Art divides model development into a series of smaller steps of increasing complexity, each concluded with a validation check improving the interpretability and robustness of the process. The current version of Art comes equipped with nine predefined steps inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Recipe for Training Neural Networks, a visualization dashboard, and integration with loggers such as Neptune. The code related to this paper is available at: https://github.com/SebChw/Actually-Robust-Training.</description>
