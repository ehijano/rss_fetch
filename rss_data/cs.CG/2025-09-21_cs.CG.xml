      <title>Efficient Heuristic Algorithms for Interleaving Distance between Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merge trees are fundamental structures in topological data analysis. Interleaving distance is a widely accepted metric for comparing merge trees, with applications in visualization and scientific computing. While a greedy algorithm exists for finding the interleaving distance between labeled merge trees with overlapping labels, computing the interleaving distance between unlabeled trees or labeled trees with disjoint labels remains a significant challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a novel heuristic algorithm for approximating the interleaving distance between labeled merge trees with partial agreement and disagreement. Our method strategically assigns labels primarily to the leaves of the trees to infer structural correspondence. We also introduce an enhanced version of a previous algorithm that offers improved performance. Both algorithms run in polynomial time and provide practical, efficient alternatives for comparing merge trees, particularly in cases involving unlabeled or structurally diverse data. This work contributes a new direction for merge tree analysis and offers promising tools for real-world applications. We demonstrate this application on the simulation of time-varying electron density.</description>

      <title>A Bouquet of Results on Maximum Range Sum: General Techniques and Hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the maximum range sum (MaxRS) problem: given a set $P$ of $n$ weighted points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a range $Q$ (typically axis-aligned $d$-box or $d$-ball), the goal is to place $Q$ to maximize the total weight of points in $P\cap Q$. We study three natural variations:
  (1) Dynamic MaxRS: The goal is to update the placement of a $d$-ball under point insertions and deletions. We give a randomized $(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation with update time $O_\epsilon(\log n)$. The approximation factor holds with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on dynamic MaxRS.
  (2) Batched MaxRS: In $\mathbb{R}^1$, along with $P$ we are given $m$ intervals of varying lengths. We prove a conditional lower bound of $\Omega(mn)$ time (via conjectured $(\min,+)$-convolution hardness), showing the trivial $O(mn\log n)$ upper bound in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is essentially tight. We also establish a similar bound for a related problem of batched smallest $k$-enclosing interval.
  (3) Colored MaxRS: Each point has a color from $[m]$, and the goal is to place $Q$ to maximize the number of uniquely colored points in $P\cap Q$. Prior work only considered axis-aligned rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For $d$-balls, we give: (a) a randomized $(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O_\epsilon(n\log n)$ time (avoiding exponential dependence on $d$), and (b) in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in expected $O_\epsilon(n\log n)$ time. Both approximations hold with high probability.
  Our algorithms rely on two techniques of broader interest. The first yields $(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximations via a volume argument on $d$-balls and a randomized game. The second achieves $(1-\epsilon)$-approximations through an exact output-sensitive algorithm, which we speed up by random sampling on colors.</description>

      <title>Lifting Cocycles: From Heuristic to Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circular coordinates algorithm, a key tool in topological data analysis, relies on a theoretically unvalidated lifting step to convert cocycles from a prime field to integer coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis of this procedure, establishing a criterion for its success. We also introduce a novel algebraic method to reduce any lifted cocycle to a cocycle with winding number 1, ensuring feature correctness. These principles are extended to homology cycles, solidifying the theoretical foundation of this widely used feature extraction technique.</description>

      <title>k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (first-order logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
  Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarsk\'y, G{\l}adkowski, Jedelsk\'y, Pilipczuk and Toru\'nczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].</description>
