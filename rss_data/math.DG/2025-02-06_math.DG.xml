      <title>$\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with torsion and the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct representations of the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra $\mathrm{SV}_a$, with parameter $a \in \mathbb{C}$, as recently proposed in the physics literature by Fiset and Gaberdiel. The geometric input for our construction are integrable $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with closed torsion, solving the heterotic $\mathrm{G}_2$ system with $\alpha'=0$ on the group manifolds $S^3\times T^4$ and $S^3\times S^3\times S^1$. From considerations in string theory, one expects the chiral algebra of these backgrounds to include $\mathrm{SV}_a$, and we provide a mathematical realization of this expectation by obtaining embeddings of $\mathrm{SV}_a$ in the corresponding superaffine vertex algebra and the chiral de Rham complex. In our examples, the parameter $a$ is proportional to the scalar torsion class of the $\mathrm{G}_2$ structure, $a \sim \tau_0$, as expected from previous work in the semi-classical limit by the second author, jointly with De la Ossa and Marchetto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain new rigidity results for stochastically complete maximal hypersurfaces in Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes that satisfy the Null Energy Condition. Under appropiate geometric assumptions we prove new parametric uniqueness and nonexistence results as well as obtain a Calabi-Bernstein type result for the maximal hypersurface equation in these ambient spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a $3$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^3$ endowed with a diagonal metric to be flat. As applications, we characterize the flat manifolds of warped product-type, more precisely, the warped, biwarped, sequential warped, and doubly warped product manifolds, and we state the corresponding nonexistence results.</description>

      <title>Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional spacetimes of expanding type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Ricci Curvature, Euclidean Volume Growth, and the Fundamental Groups of Open $4$-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In this paper, we prove that if the universal cover of $M$ has Euclidean volume growth, then the fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$ is finitely generated. This result confirms Pan-Rong's conjecture \cite{PR18} for dimension $n = 4$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a universal constant $C&gt;0$ such that $\pi_1(M)$ contains an abelian subgroup of index $\le C$. More specifically, if $\pi_1(M)$ is infinite, then $\pi_1(M)$ is a crystallographic group of rank $\le 3$. If $\pi_1(M)$ is finite, then $\pi_1(M)$ is isomorphic to a quotient of the fundamental group of a spherical 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>Regularized $\zeta_{\Delta}(1)$ for polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact polyhedral surface (a compact Riemann surface with flat conformal metric $\mathfrak{T}$ having conical singularities). The zeta-function $\zeta_\Delta(s)$ of the Friedrichs Laplacian on $X$ is meromorphic in ${\mathbb C}$ with only (simple) pole at $s=1$. We define ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ as $$\lim\limits_{s\to 1} \left( \zeta_\Delta(s)-\frac{ {\rm Area\,}(X,\mathfrak{T}) }{4\pi(s-1)}\right).$$ We derive an explicit expression for this spectral invariant through the holomorphic invariants of the Riemann surface $X$ and the (generalized) divisor of the conical points of the metric $\mathfrak{T}$. We study the asymptotics of ${\it reg\,}\zeta_\Delta(1)$ for the polyhedron obtained by sewing two other polyhedra along segments of small length. In addition, we calculate ${\it reg\,}\zeta(1)$ for a family of (non-Friedrichs) self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian on the tetrahedron with all the conical angles equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Test particles in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09503v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesics in general relativity describe the behaviour of test particles in a gravitational field. In 5D Kaluza-Klein, geodesics reproduce the Lorentz force motion of particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper studies geodesic motion on a higher-dimensional $M_4 \times K$ with background metrics encoding general 4D gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars. It shows that the classical mass and charge of a test particle become variable quantities when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime with massive gauge fields, such as the weak force field, or with non-constant Higgs scalars. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons can change the mass and charge of particles. The variation rates of mass and charge along a geodesic are given by natural geometric formulae. In regions where mass is preserved, there are additional constants of motion, one for every abelian or simple summand in the Killing algebra of $K$. The last part of the paper discusses traditional difficulties of Kaluza-Klein models, such as the low $q / m$ ratios in the 5D model. It suggests possible ways to circumvent them. It also remarks the naturalness of a model in which elementary particles always travel at the speed of light in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present applied mathematics results on the heat content of bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems and K\"ahler Duality of Complex Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is split up into two parts: The first one concerns (pseudo)-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, while the second part is about K\"ahler structures of complex coadjoint orbits. We begin the first part by investigating basic properties of holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (HHSs) like maximal holomorphic trajectories and holomorphic Hamiltonian foliations. Afterwards, we use these notions to combine HHSs with two structures frequently studied in geometry, namely Lefschetz and almost toric fibrations, leading us to the notion of a holomorphic symplectic Lefschetz fibration. Following this examination, we formulate action functionals for HHSs. These action functionals are well-suited to find periodic orbits. However, it turns out that HHSs rarely exhibit periodic orbits. One possible obstruction for a HHS to possess periodic orbits is the integrability of the underlying complex structure. To circumvent this obstruction, we introduce the notion of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems (PHHSs) which allow us to describe classical mechanics on almost complex manifolds. We show that PHHSs satisfy almost the same properties as HHSs. In the second part, we study coadjoint orbits of complex Lie groups and show that they also exhibit, next to their Hyperk\"ahler structure which was introduced by Kronheimer and Kovalev in the 90s, a holomorphic K\"ahler structure. A holomorphic K\"ahler structure can be thought of as a complexification of a usual K\"ahler structure. We call the fact that a space admits both Hyperk\"ahler and holomorphic K\"ahler structures ''K\"ahler duality''. In this thesis, we suspect that the K\"ahler duality of complex coadjoint orbits can be traced back to double cotangent bundles. Precisely speaking, we conjecture that double cotangent bundles naturally exhibit K\"ahler duality and that this K\"ahler duality transfers via reduction to complex coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <title>Minimal tetrahedra and an isoperimetric gap theorem in non-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate isoperimetric inequalities for Lipschitz 2-spheres in CAT(0) spaces, proving bounds on the volume of efficient null-homotopies. In one dimension lower, it is known that a quadratic inequality with a constant smaller than $c_2=1/(4\pi)$ -- the optimal constant for the Euclidean plane -- implies that the underlying space is Gromov hyperbolic, and a linear inequality holds. We establish the first analogous gap theorem in higher dimensions: if a proper CAT(0) space satisfies a Euclidean inequality for 2-spheres with a constant below the sharp threshold $c_3=1/(6\sqrt{\pi})$, then the space also admits an inequality with an exponent arbitrarily close to 1. As a corollary we obtain a similar result for Lipschitz surfaces of higher genus. Towards our main theorem we prove a (non-sharp) Euclidean isoperimetric inequality for null-homotopies of 2-spheres, apparently missing in the literature. A novelty in our approach is the introduction of minimal tetrahedra, which we demonstrate satisfy a linear inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the idea of equiaffine structure to the case of frontals and we define the Blaschke vector field of a frontal. We also investigate some necessary and sufficient conditions that a frontal needs to satisfy to have a Blaschke vector field and provide some examples. Finally, taking the theory developed here into account we present a fundamental theorem, which is a version for frontals of the fundamental theorem of affine differential geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work by El Kacimi Alaoui-Guasp-Nicolau, a cohomological criterion is given for a Lie $\mathfrak{g}$-foliation on a compact manifold to be rigid among nearby Lie foliations. Our aim is to look for examples of this rigidity statement in case the Lie foliation is modeled on the two-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{aff}(1)$. We study the relevant cohomology group in detail, showing that it can be expressed in terms of Morse-Novikov cohomology. We find the precise conditions under which it vanishes, which yields many examples of rigid Lie affine foliations. In particular, we show that any Lie affine foliation on a compact, connected, orientable manifold of dimension $3$ or $4$ is rigid when deformed as a Lie foliation. Our results rely on a computation of the Morse-Novikov cohomology groups associated with a nowhere-vanishing closed one-form with discrete period group, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry is a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. We develop an approach to k-contact geometry based on distributions that are distributionally maximally non-integrable and admit, locally, k commuting supplementary Lie symmetries: the k-contact distributions. We related k-contact distributions with Engel, Goursat and other distributions, which have mathematical and physical interest. We give necessary topological conditions for the existence of globally defined Lie symmetries, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, and we study and propose a k-contact Weinstein conjecture for co-oriented k-contact manifolds. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k. We relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We study Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in Lie groups for the first time. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, and we describe characteristics of Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. We use our techniques to analyse Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations. Other potential applications of k-contact distributions to non-holonomic and control systems are briefly described.</description>

      <title>Hawking's singularity theorem for Lipschitz Lorentzian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>

      <title>Regular immersions directed by algebraically elliptic cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open Riemann surface and $A$ be the punctured cone in $\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{0\}$ on a smooth projective variety $Y$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. Recently, Runge approximation theorems with interpolation for holomorphic immersions $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$, directed by $A$, have been proved under the assumption that $A$ is an Oka manifold. We prove analogous results in the algebraic setting, for regular immersions directed by $A$ from a smooth affine curve $M$ into $\mathbb{C}^n$. The Oka property is naturally replaced by the stronger assumption that $A$ is algebraically elliptic, which it is if $Y$ is uniformly rational. Under this assumption, a homotopy-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for approximation and interpolation emerges. We show that this condition is satisfied in many cases of interest.</description>

      <title>A Penrose-type inequality for static spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the total mass of the time slices of (n + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. The inequality can be viewed equivalently as a Minkowski-type inequality in these spaces, i.e. as a lower bound on the total mean curvature of the boundary, and thus extends inequalities from [3], [22], [19], and [10]. Equality is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space and is related to the characterization of quasi-spherical static vacuum metrics from [10]. As a notable special case of the main inequality, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions for static spaces under the TCC.</description>
