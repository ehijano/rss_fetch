      <title>Optimal Recovery Meets Minimax Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning is to estimate a function $f$ from possibly noisy observations of its point samples. The goal is to design a numerical algorithm to construct an approximation $\hat f$ to $f$ in a prescribed norm that asymptotically achieves the best possible error (as a function of the number $m$ of observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise). This problem has received considerable attention in both nonparametric statistics (noisy observations) and optimal recovery (noiseless observations). Quantitative bounds require assumptions on $f$, known as model class assumptions. Classical results assume that $f$ is in the unit ball of a Besov space. In nonparametric statistics, the best possible performance of an algorithm for finding $\hat f$ is known as the minimax rate and has been studied in this setting under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian. In optimal recovery, the best possible performance of an algorithm is known as the optimal recovery rate and has also been determined in this setting. While one would expect that the minimax rate recovers the optimal recovery rate when the noise level $\sigma$ tends to zero, it turns out that the current results on minimax rates do not carefully determine the dependence on $\sigma$ and the limit cannot be taken. This paper handles this issue and determines the noise-level-aware (NLA) minimax rates for Besov classes when error is measured in an $L_q$-norm with matching upper and lower bounds. The end result is a reconciliation between minimax rates and optimal recovery rates. The NLA minimax rate continuously depends on the noise level and recovers the optimal recovery rate when $\sigma$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Learning Density Evolution from Snapshot Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by learning dynamical structures from static snapshot data, this paper presents a distribution-on-scalar regression approach for estimating the density evolution of a stochastic process from its noisy temporal point clouds. We propose an entropy-regularized nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (E-NPMLE), which leverages the entropic optimal transport as a smoothing regularizer for the density flow. We show that the E-NPMLE has almost dimension-free statistical rates of convergence to the ground truth distributions, which exhibit a striking phase transition phenomenon in terms of the number of snapshots and per-snapshot sample size. To efficiently compute the E-NPMLE, we design a novel particle-based and grid-free coordinate KL divergence gradient descent (CKLGD) algorithm and prove its polynomial iteration complexity. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence on synthetic data to support our theoretical findings. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding and practical computation of estimating density evolution from noisy observations in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Semiparametrically Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider statistical inference under a semi-supervised setting where we have access to both a labeled dataset consisting of pairs $\{X_i, Y_i \}_{i=1}^n$ and an unlabeled dataset $\{ X_i \}_{i=n+1}^{n+N}$. We ask the question: under what circumstances, and by how much, can incorporating the unlabeled dataset improve upon inference using the labeled data? To answer this question, we investigate semi-supervised learning through the lens of semiparametric efficiency theory. We characterize the efficiency lower bound under the semi-supervised setting for an arbitrary inferential problem, and show that incorporating unlabeled data can potentially improve efficiency if the parameter is not well-specified. We then propose two types of semi-supervised estimators: a safe estimator that imposes minimal assumptions, is simple to compute, and is guaranteed to be at least as efficient as the initial supervised estimator; and an efficient estimator, which -- under stronger assumptions -- achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Our findings unify existing semiparametric efficiency results for particular special cases, and extend these results to a much more general class of problems. Moreover, we show that our estimators can flexibly incorporate predicted outcomes arising from ``black-box" machine learning models, and thereby achieve the same goal as prediction-powered inference (PPI), but with superior theoretical guarantees. We also provide a complete understanding of the theoretical basis for the existing set of PPI methods. Finally, we apply the theoretical framework developed to derive and analyze efficient semi-supervised estimators in a number of settings, including M-estimation, U-statistics, and average treatment effect estimation, and demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators via simulations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Outlier Detection in Non-Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for sequential outlier detection in non-stationary time series is proposed. The method tests the null hypothesis of ``no outlier'' at each time point, addressing the multiple testing problem by bounding the error probability of successive tests, using extreme value theory. The asymptotic properties of the test statistic are studied under the null hypothesis and alternative. The finite sample properties of the new detection scheme are investigated by means of a simulation study, and the method is compared with alternative procedures which have recently been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>Testing Thresholds and Spectral Properties of High-Dimensional Random Toroidal Graphs via Edgeworth-Style Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional random geometric graphs (RGGs) of edge-density $p$ with vertices uniformly distributed on the $d$-dimensional torus and edges inserted between sufficiently close vertices with respect to an $L_q$-norm. We focus on distinguishing an RGG from an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graph if both models have edge probability $p$. So far, most results considered either spherical RGGs with $L_2$-distance or toroidal RGGs under $L_\infty$-distance. However, for general $L_q$-distances, many questions remain open, especially if $p$ is allowed to depend on $n$. The main reason for this is that RGGs under $L_q$-distances can not easily be represented as the logical AND of their 1-dimensional counterparts, as for $L_\infty$ geometries. To overcome this, we devise a novel technique for quantifying the dependence between edges based on modified Edgeworth expansions.
  Our technique yields the first tight algorithmic upper bounds for distinguishing toroidal RGGs under general $L_q$ norms from ER-graphs for fixed $p$ and $q$. We achieve this by showing that signed triangles can distinguish the two models when $d\ll n^3p^3$ for the whole regime of $c/n&lt;p&lt;1$. Additionally, our technique yields an improved information-theoretic lower bound for this task, showing that the two distributions converge whenever $d=\tilde{\Omega}(n^3p^2)$, which is just as strong as the currently best known lower bound for spherical RGGs in case of general $p$ from Liu et al. [STOC'22]. Finally, our expansions allow us to tightly characterize the spectral properties of toroidal RGGs both under $L_q$-distances for fixed $1\le q&lt;\infty$, and $L_\infty$-distance. Our results partially resolve a conjecture of Bangachev and Bresler [COLT'24] and prove that the distance metric, rather than the underlying space, is responsible for the observed differences in the behavior of spherical and toroidal RGGs.</description>

      <title>Learning sparse generalized linear models with binary outcomes via iterative hard thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistics, generalized linear models (GLMs) are widely used for modeling data and can expressively capture potential nonlinear dependence of the model's outcomes on its covariates. Within the broad family of GLMs, those with binary outcomes, which include logistic and probit regressions, are motivated by common tasks such as binary classification with (possibly) non-separable data. In addition, in modern machine learning and statistics, data is often high-dimensional yet has a low intrinsic dimension, making sparsity constraints in models another reasonable consideration. In this work, we propose to use and analyze an iterative hard thresholding (projected gradient descent on the ReLU loss) algorithm, called binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT), for parameter estimation in sparse GLMs with binary outcomes. We establish that BIHT is statistically efficient and converges to the correct solution for parameter estimation in a general class of sparse binary GLMs. Unlike many other methods for learning GLMs, including maximum likelihood estimation, generalized approximate message passing, and GLM-tron (Kakade et al. 2011; Bahmani et al. 2016), BIHT does not require knowledge of the GLM's link function, offering flexibility and generality in allowing the algorithm to learn arbitrary binary GLMs. As two applications, logistic and probit regression are additionally studied. In this regard, it is shown that in logistic regression, the algorithm is in fact statistically optimal in the sense that the order-wise sample complexity matches (up to logarithmic factors) the lower bound obtained previously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work achieving statistical optimality for logistic regression in all noise regimes with a computationally efficient algorithm. Moreover, for probit regression, our sample complexity is on the same order as that obtained for logistic regression.</description>

      <title>Estimating Time Delays between Signals under Mixed Noise Influence with Novel Cross- and Bispectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common problem to signal processing are biases introduced by correlated noise. In Time-Delay Estimation (TDE), which quantifies a time lag between two signals, noise mixing introduces a bias towards zero delay in conventional TDE protocols based on the cross- or bispectrum. Here we propose two novel TDE approaches that address these shortcomings: (1) A cross-spectrum based TDE protocol that relies on estimating the periodicity of the phase spectrum rather than its slope, and (2) a bispectrum based TDE analysis, bispectral antisymmetrization, which removes contributions from not just Gaussian but all independent sources. In a simulation study, we compare conventional and novel TDE protocols and resolve differences in performance with respect to noise Gaussianity and auto-correlation structure. As a proof-of-concept, we also perform TDE analysis on a neural stimulation dataset (n=3). We find that antisymmetrization consistently outperforms conventional bispectral TDE methods at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and removes spurious zero-delay estimates in all mixed-noise environments. TDE based on phase periodicity also improves signal sensitivity compared to conventional cross-spectral methods. These observations are stable with respect to the magnitude of the delay and the statistical properties of the noise.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Under Generalized Covariate Shift with Posterior Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real applications of statistical learning, collecting sufficiently many training data is often expensive, time-consuming, or even unrealistic. In this case, a transfer learning approach, which aims to leverage knowledge from a related source domain to improve the learning performance in the target domain, is more beneficial. There have been many transfer learning methods developed under various distributional assumptions. In this article, we study a particular type of classification problem, called conformal prediction, under a new distributional assumption for transfer learning. Classifiers under the conformal prediction framework predict a set of plausible labels instead of one single label for each data instance, affording a more cautious and safer decision. We consider a generalization of the \textit{covariate shift with posterior drift} setting for transfer learning. Under this setting, we propose a weighted conformal classifier that leverages both the source and target samples, with a coverage guarantee in the target domain. Theoretical studies demonstrate favorable asymptotic properties. Numerical studies further illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are ubiquitous in empirical research, yet their connection to subsequent decision-making is often unclear. We develop a theory of certified decisions that pairs recommended decisions with inferential guarantees. Specifically, we attach P-certificates -- upper bounds on loss that hold with probability at least $1-\alpha$ -- to recommended actions. We show that such certificates allow "safe," risk-controlling adoption decisions for ambiguity-averse downstream decision-makers. We further prove that it is without loss to limit attention to P-certificates arising as minimax decisions over confidence sets, or what Manski (2021) terms "as-if decisions with a set estimate." A parallel argument applies to E-certified decisions obtained from e-values in settings with unbounded loss.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <title>A Unified Bayesian Perspective for Conventional and Robust Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new perspective on the origin and interpretation of adaptive filters. By applying Bayesian principles of recursive inference from the state-space model and using a series of simplifications regarding the structure of the solution, we can present, in a unified framework, derivations of many adaptive filters which depend on the probabilistic model of the observational noise. In particular, under a Gaussian model, we obtain solutions well-known in the literature (such as LMS, NLMS, or Kalman filter), while using non-Gaussian noise, we obtain new families of adaptive filter. Notably, under assumption of Laplacian noise, we obtain a family of robust filters of which the signed-error algorithm is a well-known member, while other algorithms, derived effortlessly in the proposed framework, are entirely new. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the properties and provide a better insight into the performance of the derived adaptive filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spiked Fisher matrix is a significant topic for two-sample problems in multivariate statistical inference. This paper is dedicated to testing the number of spikes in a high-dimensional generalized spiked Fisher matrix that relaxes the Gaussian population assumption and the diagonal constraints on the population covariance matrices. First, we propose a general test statistic predicated on partial linear spectral statistics to test the number of spikes, then establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for this statistic under the null hypothesis. Second, we apply the CLT to address two statistical problems: variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression and change point detection. For each test problem, we construct new statistics and derive their asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis. Finally, simulations and empirical analysis are conducted to demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness and generality of our proposed methods across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric logistic regression with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the nonparametric logistic regression problem. In the logistic regression, we usually consider the maximum likelihood estimator, and the excess risk is the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true and estimated conditional class probabilities. However, in the nonparametric logistic regression, the KL divergence could diverge easily, and thus, the convergence of the excess risk is difficult to prove or does not hold. Several existing studies show the convergence of the KL divergence under strong assumptions. In most cases, our goal is to estimate the true conditional class probabilities. Thus, instead of analyzing the excess risk itself, it suffices to show the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator in some suitable metric. In this paper, using a simple unified approach for analyzing the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE), we directly derive convergence rates of the NPMLE in the Hellinger distance under mild assumptions. Although our results are similar to the results in some existing studies, we provide simple and more direct proofs for these results. As an important application, we derive convergence rates of the NPMLE with fully connected deep neural networks and show that the derived rate nearly achieves the minimax optimal rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the goal of conducting inference about a smooth finite-dimensional parameter by utilizing individual-level data from various independent sources. Recent advancements have led to the development of a comprehensive theory capable of handling scenarios where different data sources align with, possibly distinct subsets of, conditional distributions of a single factorization of the joint target distribution. While this theory proves effective in many significant contexts, it falls short in certain common data fusion problems, such as two-sample instrumental variable analysis, settings that integrate data from epidemiological studies with diverse designs (e.g., prospective cohorts and retrospective case-control studies), and studies with variables prone to measurement error that are supplemented by validation studies. In this paper, we extend the aforementioned comprehensive theory to allow for the fusion of individual-level data from sources aligned with conditional distributions that do not correspond to a single factorization of the target distribution. Assuming conditional and marginal distribution alignments, we provide universal results that characterize the class of all influence functions of regular asymptotically linear estimators and the efficient influence function of any pathwise differentiable parameter, irrespective of the number of data sources, the specific parameter of interest, or the statistical model for the target distribution. This theory paves the way for machine-learning debiased, semiparametric efficient estimation.</description>

      <title>Graphical lasso for extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we estimate the sparse dependence structure in the tail region of a multivariate random vector, potentially of high dimension. The tail dependence is modeled via a graphical model for extremes embedded in the H\"usler-Reiss distribution. We propose the extreme graphical lasso procedure to estimate the sparsity in the tail dependence, similar to the Gaussian graphical lasso in high dimensional statistics. We prove its consistency in identifying the graph structure and estimating model parameters. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are illustrated by simulations and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration for Prediction in a Multi-Output Transposition Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are widely used to predict the behavior of physical systems, with Bayesian approaches being particularly well suited for this purpose. However, experimental observations are necessary to calibrate certain simulator parameters for the prediction. In this work, we use a multi-output simulator to predict all its outputs, including those that have never been experimentally observed. This situation is referred to as the transposition context. To accurately quantify the discrepancy between model outputs and real data in this context, conventional methods cannot be applied, and the Bayesian calibration must be augmented by incorporating a joint model error across all outputs. To achieve this, the proposed method is to consider additional numerical input parameters within a hierarchical Bayesian model, which includes hyperparameters for the prior distribution of the calibration variables. This approach is applied on a computer code with three outputs that models the Taylor cylinder impact test with a small number of observations. The outputs are considered as the observed variables one at a time, to work with three different transposition situations. The proposed method is compared with other approaches that embed model errors to demonstrate the significance of the hierarchical formulation.</description>

      <title>Impossibility results for equating the Youden Index with average scoring rules and Tjur $R^2$-like metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Youden index fas well as measures evaluating predicted probabilities for the maximum-likelihood estimate of a logistic regression model with predictor the classifier. We give impossibility results showing that the Youden index can not equal any average of a real scoring rule nor any metric averaging over binary outcomes (0s and 1s) for any continuous real-valued scoring rule. This shows the obstructions of such potential equivalences and highlights the distinct roles these metrics play in diagnostic assessment.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>

      <title>Generalization error bound for denoising score matching under relaxed manifold assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine theoretical properties of the denoising score matching estimate. We model the density of observations with a nonparametric Gaussian mixture. We significantly relax the standard manifold assumption allowing the samples step away from the manifold. At the same time, we are still able to leverage a nice distribution structure. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation and generalization errors of the denoising score matching estimate. The rates of convergence are determined by the intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, our bounds remain valid even if we allow the ambient dimension grow polynomially with the sample size.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Full-information Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analysis of Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling with a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature has a $\mathcal{O}(\beta\sqrt{T\log(1+\lambda)})$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz adversary.</description>
