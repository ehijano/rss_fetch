      <title>Antenna Activation and Resource Allocation in Multi-Waveguide Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas, as a novel flexible-antenna technology capable of establishing line of sight (LoS) connections and effectively mitigating large-scale path loss, have recently attracted considerable research interests. However, the implementation of ideal pinching-antenna systems involves determining and adjusting pinching antennas to an arbitrary position on waveguides, which presents challenges to both practical deployment and related optimization. This paper investigates a practical pinching-antennas system in multi-waveguide scenarios, where pinching antennas are installed at pre-configured discrete positions to serve downlink users with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To improve system throughput, a sophisticated optimization problem is formulated by jointly considering waveguide assignment, antenna activation, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order design, and power allocation. By treating waveguide assignment and antenna activation as two coalition-formation games, a novel game-theoretic algorithm is developed, in which the optimal decoding order is derived and incorporated. For power allocation, monotonic optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to construct global optimal and low-complexity solutions, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the NOMA-based pinching-antenna system exhibits superior performance compared to the considered benchmark systems, and the proposed solutions provide significant improvement in terms of sum rate and outage probability.</description>

      <title>USF Spectral Estimation: Prevalence of Gaussian Cram\'er-Rao Bounds Despite Modulo Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral Estimation (SpecEst) is a core area of signal processing with a history spanning two centuries and applications across various fields. With the advent of digital acquisition, SpecEst algorithms have been widely applied to tasks like frequency super-resolution. However, conventional digital acquisition imposes a trade-off: for a fixed bit budget, one can optimize either signal dynamic range or digital resolution (noise floor), but not both simultaneously. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) overcomes this limitation using modulo non-linearity in analog hardware, enabling a novel approach to SpecEst (USF-SpecEst). However, USF-SpecEst requires new theoretical and algorithmic developments to handle folded samples effectively. In this paper, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for SpecEst with noisy modulo-folded samples and reveal a surprising result: the CRBs for USF-SpecEst are scaled versions of the Gaussian CRBs for conventional samples. Numerical experiments validate these bounds, providing a benchmark for USF-SpecEst and facilitating its practical deployment.</description>

      <title>GNN-enabled Precoding for Massive MIMO LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a critical component in the development of sixth generation (6G) networks. The integration of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is being actively explored to enhance the performance of LEO satellite communications. However, the limited power of LEO satellites poses a significant challenge in improving communication energy efficiency (EE) under constrained power conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly recognized as promising solutions for optimizing energy consumption while enhancing system performance, thus enabling more efficient and sustainable communications. This paper proposes approaches to address the challenges associated with precoding in massive MIMO LEO satellite communications. First, we introduce an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) framework that effectively reduces the computational complexity of traditional precoding methods. Next, we introduce a deep unfolding of the Dinkelbach algorithm and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach to achieve enhanced EE, transforming iterative optimization processes into a structured neural network, thereby improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the Taylor expansion method to approximate matrix inversion within the GNN, enhancing both the interpretability and performance of the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed method in terms of complexity and robustness, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid NOMA Assisted Heterogeneous Semantic and Bit Users Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a downlink hybrid Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) framework to support multiple semantic and bit users within the communication network. The hybrid NOMA setup exploits both NOMA and Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) which has the benefit of enhancing Spectral Efficiency (SE) by allowing users to dynamically access the resources in multiple heterogeneous slots. This enables integrating semantic and bit users based on their channel gains, while adopting bit-to-semantic decoding order in slots including heterogeneous users. An optimization problem for the power allocation is formulated with the aim of maximizing the equivalent ergodic semantic SE with a constraint on the total available power of the Access Point (AP). The proposed algorithm uses NOMA in shared slots and OMA in bit-user-only slots. Simulation results validate the benefits of heterogeneous users hybrid NOMA setup in comparison to OMA-only for heterogeneous users.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Distributed Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning considers the removal of the contribution of a set of data points from a trained model. In a distributed setting, where a server orchestrates training using data available at a set of remote users, unlearning is essential to cope with late-detected malicious or corrupted users. Existing distributed unlearning algorithms require the server to store all model updates observed in training, leading to immense storage overhead for preserving the ability to unlearn. In this work we study lossy compression schemes for facilitating distributed server-side unlearning with limited memory footprint. We propose memory-efficient distributed unlearning (MEDU), a hierarchical lossy compression scheme tailored for server-side unlearning, that integrates user sparsification, differential thresholding, and random lattice coding, to substantially reduce memory footprint. We rigorously analyze MEDU, deriving an upper bound on the difference between the desired model that is trained from scratch and the model unlearned from lossy compressed stored updates. Our bound outperforms the state-of-the-art known bounds for non-compressed decentralized server-side unlearning, even when lossy compression is incorporated. We further provide a numerical study, which shows that suited lossy compression can enable distributed unlearning with notably reduced memory footprint at the server while preserving the utility of the unlearned model.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of a Robust Tolerance Optimisation Framework for Automated Optical Inspection in Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) is widely used across various industries, including surface mount technology in semiconductor manufacturing. One of the key challenges in AOI is optimising inspection tolerances. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on the expertise and intuition of engineers, making it subjective and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we are developing an intelligent, data-driven approach to optimise inspection tolerances in a more objective and consistent manner. Most existing research in this area focuses primarily on minimising false calls, often at the risk of allowing actual defects to go undetected. This oversight can compromise product quality, especially in critical sectors such as medical, defence, and automotive industries. Our approach introduces the use of percentile rank, amongst other logical strategies, to ensure that genuine defects are not overlooked. With continued refinement, our method aims to reach a point where every flagged item is a true defect, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection. Our proof of concept achieved an 18% reduction in false calls at the 80th percentile rank, while maintaining a 100% recall rate. This makes the system both efficient and reliable, offering significant time and cost savings.</description>

      <title>Affine Filter Bank Modulation: A New Waveform for High Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new waveform suitable for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems facing doubly-dispersive (DD) channel conditions, as typically encountered in high mobility scenarios. Dubbed Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM), this novel waveform is designed based on a filter-bank structure, known for its ability to suppress out-of-band emissions (OOBE), while integrating a discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) precoding stage which yields low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and robustness to DD distortion, as well as other features desirable for ISAC. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that AFBM maintains quasi-orthogonality similar to that of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in DD channels, while achieving PAPR levels 3 dB lower, in addition to OOBE as low as -100 dB when implemented with PHYDYAS prototype filters.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Users in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Stream Allocation and Necessity of Downlink Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple antennas on the users and access points (APs). In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well for single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent when having multi-antenna users. The reason is that the effective channel matrix does not harden. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme, derive a new SE expression, and show numerically that it yields substantially higher performance when having correlated Rayleigh fading channels.
  In cases with multi-antenna users, the APs can either transmit the same or different data streams. The latter reduces the fronthaul signaling but comes with a SE loss. We propose precoding and combining schemes for these cases and consider whether channel knowledge is shared between the APs. Finally, we show numerically how the number of users, APs, and the number of antennas on users and APs affect the SE.</description>

      <title>Edge Large AI Models: Collaborative Deployment and IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) emulate human-like problem-solving capabilities across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. By leveraging the communication and computation resources of geographically distributed edge devices, edge LAMs enable real-time intelligent services at the network edge. Unlike conventional edge AI, which relies on small or moderate-sized models for direct feature-to-prediction mappings, edge LAMs leverage the intricate coordination of modular components to enable context-aware generative tasks and multi-modal inference. We shall propose a collaborative deployment framework for edge LAM by characterizing the LAM intelligent capabilities and limited edge network resources. Specifically, we propose a collaborative training framework over heterogeneous edge networks that adaptively decomposes LAMs according to computation resources, data modalities, and training objectives, reducing communication and computation overheads during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, we introduce a microservice-based inference framework that virtualizes the functional modules of edge LAMs according to their architectural characteristics, thereby improving resource utilization and reducing inference latency. The developed edge LAM will provide actionable solutions to enable diversified Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, facilitated by constructing mappings from diverse sensor data to token representations and fine-tuning based on domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Rapid diagnostics of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces using space-time-coding modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key technology for shaping smart wireless environments in next-generation wireless communication systems. To support the large-scale deployment of RISs, a reliable and efficient diagnostic method is essential to ensure optimal performance. In this work, a robust and efficient approach for RIS diagnostics is proposed using a space-time coding strategy with orthogonal codes. The method encodes the reflected signals from individual RIS elements into distinct code channels, enabling the recovery of channel power at the receiving terminals for fault identification. Theoretical analysis shows that the normally functioning elements generate high power in their respective code channels, whereas the faulty elements exhibit significantly lower power. This distinction enables rapid and accurate diagnostics of elements' operational states through simple signal processing techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, even under high fault ratios and varying reception angles. Proof-of-principle experiments on two RIS prototypes are conducted, implementing two coding strategies: direct and segmented. Experimental results in a realistic scenario confirm the reliability of the diagnostic method, demonstrating its potential for large-scale RIS deployment in future wireless communication systems and radar applications.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Drum Machine: Source Separation Through Joint Transcription and Analysis-by-Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Inverse Drum Machine (IDM), a novel approach to drum source separation that combines analysis-by-synthesis with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that rely on isolated stems, IDM requires only transcription annotations. It jointly optimizes automatic drum transcription and one-shot drum sample synthesis in an end-to-end framework. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets-mimicking a drum machine-IDM reconstructs individual drum stems and trains a neural network to match the original mixture. Evaluations on the StemGMD dataset show that IDM achieves separation performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, while substantially outperforming matrix decomposition baselines.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Sylvester Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Inference in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique to measure the metabolic composition of tissues, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders, tumor detection, and other metabolic dysfunctions. However, accurate metabolite quantification is hindered by challenges such as spectral overlap, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various artifacts. Traditional methods like linear-combination modeling are susceptible to ambiguities and commonly only provide a theoretical lower bound on estimation accuracy in the form of the Cram\'er-Rao bound. This work introduces a Bayesian inference framework using Sylvester normalizing flows (SNFs) to approximate posterior distributions over metabolite concentrations, enhancing quantification reliability. A physics-based decoder incorporates prior knowledge of MRS signal formation, ensuring realistic distribution representations. We validate the method on simulated 7T proton MRS data, demonstrating accurate metabolite quantification, well-calibrated uncertainties, and insights into parameter correlations and multi-modal distributions.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Mulsemedia Communication using Unified Perceiver and Conformal Prediction in 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prominence of eXtended Reality (XR), holographic-type communications, and metaverse demands truly immersive user experiences by using many sensory modalities, including sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, etc. Additionally, the widespread deployment of sensors in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, and smart homes is generating diverse sensory data. A new media format known as multisensory media (mulsemedia) has emerged, which incorporates many sensory modalities beyond the traditional visual and auditory media. 6G wireless systems are envisioned to support the Internet of Senses, making it crucial to explore effective data fusion and communication strategies for mulsemedia. In this paper, we introduce a task-oriented multi-task mulsemedia communication system named MuSeCo, which is developed using unified Perceiver models and Conformal Prediction. This unified model can accept any sensory input and efficiently extract latent semantic features, making it adaptable for deployment across various Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices. Conformal Prediction is employed for modality selection and combination, enhancing task accuracy while minimizing data communication overhead. The model is trained using six sensory modalities across four classification tasks. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that it can effectively fuse sensory modalities, significantly reduce end-to-end communication latency and energy consumption, and maintain high accuracy in communication-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>radarODE-MTL: A Multi-Task Learning Framework with Eccentric Gradient Alignment for Robust Radar-Based ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations.

      <title>Characterizing Trust and Resilience in Distributed Consensus for Cyberphysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.05464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.</description>

      <title>AI-Aided Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Polarization under the Channel Noise with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of channel polarization under noise with memory. By introducing a genie-aided channel model, we demonstrate that polarized subchannels still converge to extremal channels under the standard polar coding structure. Notably, the proportion of near-perfect subchannels can exceed the underlying channel capacity $I(W)$. However, we also show that the polarization rate is slower than that observed in the binary-input memoryless channel (BMC) scenario. In particular, the block error probability is upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(L^{-c_0})$, where $L$ denotes the block length and $c_0$ is a positive constant. Moreover, we investigate both upper and lower bounds on the gap between the channel capacity and the cutoff rate under finite block length, which offers greater relevance for practical implementations.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Evaluation of Approximate Softmax Functions for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The softmax function is a widely used activation function in the output layers of neural networks, responsible for converting raw scores into class probabilities while introducing essential non-linearity. Implementing Softmax efficiently poses challenges on low-end FPGAs due to limited hardware resources and the computational complexity of exponential and division operations. This work evaluates approximate computing techniques for softmax acceleration using Taylor series and interpolation methods using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). These approximations aim to reduce execution time and resource consumption while maintaining acceptable levels of numerical precision. Our findings show that quadratic interpolation with LUTs yields the lowest numerical error. In contrast, Taylor-based approximations offer significantly better performance in terms of execution time and resource efficiency due to their computational simplicity. When applied to real-world deep learning models such as LeNet-5 and MobileNet v2, the first- and second-order Taylor approximations provided substantial trade-offs between accuracy and resource savings, achieving up to 0.2% accuracy degradation and 14% resource reduction compared to exact implementations. These results highlight the effectiveness of approximate Softmax designs on resource-constrained FPGAs and lay the groundwork for their integration into larger models, including large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection using an Adaptive Learnable Beamformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replay attacks belong to the class of severe threats against voice-controlled systems, exploiting the easy accessibility of speech signals by recorded and replayed speech to grant unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this work, we propose a multi-channel neural network architecture called M-ALRAD for the detection of replay attacks based on spatial audio features. This approach integrates a learnable adaptive beamformer with a convolutional recurrent neural network, allowing for joint optimization of spatial filtering and classification. Experiments have been carried out on the ReMASC dataset, which is a state-of-the-art multi-channel replay speech detection dataset encompassing four microphones with diverse array configurations and four environments. Results on the ReMASC dataset show the superiority of the approach compared to the state-of-the-art and yield substantial improvements for challenging acoustic environments. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is able to better generalize to unseen environments with respect to prior studies.</description>
