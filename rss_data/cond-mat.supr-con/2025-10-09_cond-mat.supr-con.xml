      <title>Hund's coupling assisted orbital-selective superconductivity in Ba1-xKxFe2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition. Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure, where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital superconductors.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments which report Kekul\'e ordering in the twisted graphene family, we develop a microscopic theory of superconductivity, specifically for the bi-layer case. This involves an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) which naturally incorporates a Kekul\'e distortion into the superconducting phase. The PDW state displays three central features: (i) it spontaneously breaks $C_3$ rotational symmetry, producing nematic order, and (ii) it possesses a large gap-to-critical-temperature ratio. Moreover, (iii) it yields a quasi-particle density of states having a V-like shape (with a finite value at zero energy) which transitions to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum with increasing attraction. These characteristics, including consistency with an allowed Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, align with key experimental signatures in the twisted graphene family where the U-V transition is observed in the tri-layer case. We find the paired state with a modest interaction strength is near to a BEC-like regime, as appears consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Together, these results establish a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW state as an essential ingredient towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in twisted graphene.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.</description>

      <title>Field-Induced SIT in Disordered 2D Electron systems: The case of amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e. well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum critical field not far below the MR peak.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of Incoherent Electrons near the Relativistic Mott Transition in Twisted Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent, allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the proximate insulating state.</description>

      <title>Experimental Results from Early Non-Planar NI-HTS Magnet Prototypes for the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX) is an upgrade of the Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) that aims to demonstrate a university-scale, quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) technology at an on-axis magnetic field target of 0.5 T. Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.</description>

      <title>Entangling remote qubits through a two-mode squeezed reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated superconducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of Fibonacci chains with enhanced superconducting pairing at the boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</description>

      <title>Current-Enabled Optical Conductivity of Collective Modes in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ from the Perspective of Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high transition temperature ($T_{c}$) under high pressure. Shortly after this discovery, thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ was demonstrated to exhibit ambient-pressure superconductivity; however, the corresponding $T_c$ is only about half that of the pressurized bulk material. This striking difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing superconductivity in these two structures. To address this issue, we develop a symmetry-based method that investigates superconducting pairings solely based on experimentally determined symmetry and $T_c$, without assuming any specific superconducting parameters. Applying this approach, we find that both pressurized bulk and thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ exhibit $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing symmetry and two-gap superconductivity, yet their dominant microscopic origins are distinct. In the pressurized bulk, superconductivity is dominated by out-of-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, while in the thin film, in-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals prevails. Furthermore, the observed reduction in $T_c$ can be attributed to this transition of the dominant pairing types, driven by the decreased ratio of inter-layer to intra-layer hoppings in the thin film. Our result sheds lights on the microscopic pairings in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ and reveal the significance of the symmetry. This method can potentially be generalized to a broader range of unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</description>

      <title>In-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistances of FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and increases with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination by the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.</description>

      <title>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking states of correlated electrons: Antiferromagnetic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases in many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions that represent transient processes during which some properties of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Connecting the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one within the Baym-Kadanoff scheme, beyond the static mean-field approximation, remains an unresolved, long-standing challenge. We identify the reason why approximations with critical dynamical fluctuations in the Schwinger-Dyson equation lead to a mismatch in the transition temperatures calculated from the high- and low-temperature phases. We propose a solution to this generic problem by excluding anomalous contributions to response functions that do not obey conservation of excitations in their interactions. We illustrate this behavior using the example of an antiferromagnetic state. We reveal that the spectral function in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits a double-gap structure at zero temperature when the anomalous self-energy is frequency-dependent.</description>

      <title>Voltage-tuned anomalous-metal to metal transition in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Generation of a scalar vortex in a rotational frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>
