      <title>A Tutorial on Fluid Antenna System for 6G Networks: Encompassing Communication Theory, Optimization Methods and Hardware Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) networks presents another round of revolution for the mobile communication landscape, promising an immersive experience, robust reliability, minimal latency, extreme connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, and capabilities beyond communication, including intelligence and sensing. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is apparent that 6G networks need to incorporate the state-of-the-art technologies. One of the technologies that has garnered rising interest is fluid antenna system (FAS) which represents any software-controllable fluidic, conductive, or dielectric structure capable of dynamically changing its shape and position to reconfigure essential radio-frequency (RF) characteristics. Compared to traditional antenna systems (TASs) with fixed-position radiating elements, the core idea of FAS revolves around the unique flexibility of reconfiguring the radiating elements within a given space. One recent driver of FAS is the recognition of its position-flexibility as a new degree of freedom (dof) to harness diversity and multiplexing gains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial, covering channel modeling, signal processing and estimation methods, information-theoretic insights, new multiple access techniques, and hardware designs. Moreover, we delineate the challenges of FAS and explore the potential of using FAS to improve the performance of other contemporary technologies. By providing insights and guidance, this tutorial paper serves to inspire researchers to explore new horizons and fully unleash the potential of FAS.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Over-the-Air Federated Learning by Using AI-based Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates an over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system that employs fluid antennas (FAs) at the access point (AP) to enhance learning performance by leveraging the additional degrees of freedom provided by antenna mobility. First, we analyze the convergence of the OTA-FL system and derive the optimality gap to illustrate the influence of FAs on learning performance. Then, we formulate a nonconvex optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the positions of the FAs and the beamforming vector. To address the dynamic environment, we cast this optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose the recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations show that the FA-assisted OTA-FL system outperforms systems with fixed-position antennas and that the RDPG algorithm surpasses the existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Bistatic Sensing System in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing is anticipated to have wider extensions in communication systems with the boom of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) during the past years. In this paper, we study a bistatic sensing system by maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ration (SINR) from the target aircraft in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). We formulate a joint optimization problem for the transmit beamforming of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite and the receive filtering of ground base station. To tackle this problem, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems and use the alternating optimization to solve them iteratively. Using techniques of fractional programming and generalized Rayleigh quotient, the closed-form solution for each sub-problem is returned. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence performance.Moreover, the optimization of receive filtering dominates the optimality, especially when the satellite altitude becomes higher, which provides valuable network design insights.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design and Bit Allocation in Massive MIMO with Resolution-Adaptive ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption and complexity in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems while maintaining satisfactory spectral and energy efficiencies (SE/EE). In this work, we first identify the essential properties of optimal quantization and leverage them to derive a closed-form approximation of the covariance matrix of the quantization distortion. The theoretical finding facilitates the system SE analysis in the presence of low-resolution ADCs. We then focus on the joint optimization of the transmit-receive beamforming and bit allocation to maximize the SE under constraints on the transmit power and the total number of active ADC bits. To solve the resulting mixed-integer problem, we first develop an efficient beamforming design for fixed ADC resolutions. Then, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to iteratively optimize the ADC resolutions and beamforming matrices. Numerical results for a $64 \times 64$ MIMO system demonstrate that the proposed design offers $6\%$ improvement in both SE and EE with $40\%$ fewer active ADC bits compared with the uniform bit allocation. Furthermore, we numerically show that receiving more data streams with low-resolution ADCs can achieve higher SE and EE compared to receiving fewer data streams with high-resolution ADCs.</description>

      <title>Detection and Multi-Parameter Estimation for NLOS Targets: An IRS-assisted Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has the potential to enhance sensing performance, due to its capability of reshaping the echo signals. Different from the existing literature, which has commonly focused on IRS beamforming optimization, in this paper, we pay special attention to designing effective signal processing approaches to extract sensing information from IRS-reshaped echo signals. To this end, we investigate an IRS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLOS) target detection and multi-parameter estimation problem in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To address this problem, we first propose a novel detection and direction estimation framework, including a low-overhead hierarchical codebook that allows the IRS to generate three-dimensional beams with adjustable beam direction and width, a delay spectrum peak-based beam training scheme for detection and direction estimation, and a beam refinement scheme for further enhancing the accuracy of the direction estimation. Then, we propose a target range and velocity estimation scheme by extracting the delay-Doppler information from the IRS-reshaped echo signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve 99.7% target detection rate, a 10^{-3}-rad level direction estimation accuracy, and a 10^{-6}-m/10^{-5}-m/s level range/velocity estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust Affine Formation Control of Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine formation control is a subset of formation control methods, which has gained increasing popularity for its flexibility and maneuverability in diverse applications. Affine formation control is inherently distributed in nature, where the local controllers onboard each agent are linearly dependent on the relative position measurements of the neighboring agents. The unavailability of these measurements in practice, due to node failure or missing links, leads to a change in the underlying graph topology, and subsequently causes instability and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an estimation framework to enhance the robustness of distributed affine formation control systems against these topology changes. Our estimation framework features an adaptive fusion of both temporal information from the dynamics of agents and spatial information which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We propose a suite of algorithms under this framework to tackle various practical scenarios, and numerically verify our proposed estimator on stability, convergence rate, and optimality criterion. Simulations show the performance of our proposed algorithms as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and we summarize them with future research directions.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Beam-Level and Cell-Level Mobility Management for High Speed Railway Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications, including the use cases, inputs, outputs, and key performance indicators (KPI)s of AI models. Particularly, in comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, we show that the compressed spatial multi-beam measurements via compressive sensing lead to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance gains of AI-assisted cell handover over traditional mobile handover mechanisms. In addition, we observe that the proposed approaches to reduce the measurement overhead achieve comparable radio link failure performance with the traditional approach that requires all the beam measurements of all cells, while the former methods can save 50% beam measurement overhead.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Receiver Design for Massive MIMO-OFDM with Low-Resolution ADCs and Oversampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and hybrid beamforming have emerged as efficient solutions to reduce power consumption with satisfactory spectral efficiency (SE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid receiver in uplink massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with low-resolution ADCs and oversampling. Considering both the temporal and spatial correlation of the quantization distortion (QD), we derive a closed-form approximation of the frequency-domain QD covariance matrix, which facilitates the evaluation of the system SE. Then we jointly design the analog and baseband combiners to maximize the SE. The formulated problem is significantly challenging due to the constant-modulus constraint of the analog combiner and its coupling with the digital one. To overcome the challenges, we transform the objective function into an equivalent but more tractable form and then iteratively update the analog and digital combiner. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the considered benchmarks and show the resilience of the hybrid receiver to beam squint for low-resolution systems. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed hybrid receiver design with oversampling can achieve significantly higher energy efficiency compared to the digital one.</description>

      <title>Critical Near-Field Impedance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical impedance equations for several near-field antenna positions. In the standard model one computes the currents at the antennas for given voltages using the impedance matrix of the antennas, which is only possible if the determinant of the impedance matrix is non-zero. We consider Hertzian group antennas, its relative corresponding impedance and two approximations (mid and far) of it. For the approximations we show that for many situations the determinant is zero.
  We find three antenna configurations for three antennas, i.e., on a line, on a right triangle, and an isosceles triangle, which result in a zero determinant of the impedance for the far-field approximation. This means that with existing methods, one cannot determine the behavior of this antenna system. For the better mid approximation, we find a configuration of 15 triangular-positioned antennas resulting in a singular impedance matrix.
  Furthermore, we investigate $n\times n$ grid placed antennas in the more accurate Hertzian impedance model and find that for $d \approx 4.1$ wavelengths of grid distance for n=2, ..., 8 the absolute value of the determinant of the corresponding impedance matrix decreases by an order of magnitude with each increased grid size.</description>

      <title>An Outline of Prognostics and Health Management Large Model: Concepts, Paradigms, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prognosis and Health Management (PHM), critical for ensuring task completion by complex systems and preventing unexpected failures, is widely adopted in aerospace, manufacturing, maritime, rail, energy, etc. However, PHM's development is constrained by bottlenecks like generalization, interpretation and verification abilities. Presently, generative artificial intelligence (AI), represented by Large Model, heralds a technological revolution with the potential to fundamentally reshape traditional technological fields and human production methods. Its capabilities, including strong generalization, reasoning, and generative attributes, present opportunities to address PHM's bottlenecks. To this end, based on a systematic analysis of the current challenges and bottlenecks in PHM, as well as the research status and advantages of Large Model, we propose a novel concept and three progressive paradigms of Prognosis and Health Management Large Model (PHM-LM) through the integration of the Large Model with PHM. Subsequently, we provide feasible technical approaches for PHM-LM to bolster PHM's core capabilities within the framework of the three paradigms. Moreover, to address core issues confronting PHM, we discuss a series of technical challenges of PHM-LM throughout the entire process of construction and application. This comprehensive effort offers a holistic PHM-LM technical framework, and provides avenues for new PHM technologies, methodologies, tools, platforms and applications, which also potentially innovates design, research &amp; development, verification and application mode of PHM. And furthermore, a new generation of PHM with AI will also capably be realized, i.e., from custom to generalized, from discriminative to generative, and from theoretical conditions to practical applications.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Wireless Sensing and Communication: Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies has precipitated an unprecedented demand for high data rates, extremely low latency, and ubiquitous connectivity. In order to achieve these goals, stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) has been developed as a novel solution to perform advanced signal processing tasks directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, thus achieving ultra-fast computing speed and reducing hardware complexity. This article provides an overview of the SIM technology by discussing its hardware architectures, advantages, and potential applications for wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, we explore the utilization of SIMs in enabling wave-domain beamforming, channel modeling and estimation in SIM-assisted communication systems. Furthermore, we elaborate on the potential of utilizing a SIM to build a hybrid optical-electronic neural network (HOENN) and demonstrate its efficacy by examining two case studies: disaster monitoring and direction-of-arrival estimation. Finally, we identify key implementation challenges, including practical hardware imperfections, efficient SIM configuration for realizing wave-domain signal processing, and performance analysis to motivate future research on this important and far-reaching topic.</description>

      <title>Decoding Analog Subspace Codes: Algorithms for Character-Polynomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed--Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently received significant research interest due to its ability to efficiently use resources from different domains and also its compatibility with various orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based legacy networks. Unlike existing studies on hybrid NOMA that focus on combining NOMA with time-division multiple access (TDMA), this work considers hybrid NOMA assisted orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In particular, the impact of a unique feature of hybrid NOMA assisted OFDMA, i.e., the availability of users' dynamic channel state information, on the system performance is analyzed from the following two perspectives. From the optimization perspective, analytical results are developed which show that with hybrid NOMA assisted OFDMA, the pure OMA mode is rarely adopted by the users, and the pure NOMA mode could be optimal for minimizing the users' energy consumption, which differs from the hybrid TDMA case. From the statistical perspective, two new performance metrics, namely the power outage probability and the power diversity gain, are developed to quantitatively measure the performance gain of hybrid NOMA over OMA. The developed analytical results also demonstrate the ability of hybrid NOMA to meet the users' diverse energy profiles.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the fundamental performance limits of integrated sensing and communication systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a key enabler and feature of future wireless networks. In the existing works analyzing the performances of ISAC, discrete-time systems were commonly assumed, which, however, overlooked the impacts of temporal, spectral, and spatial properties. To address this issue, we establish a unified information model for the band-limited continuous-time ISAC systems. In the established information model, we employ a novel sensing performance metric, called the sensing mutual information (SMI). Through analysis, we show how the SMI can be utilized as a bridge between the mutual information domain and the mean squared error (MSE) domain. In addition, we illustrate the communication mutual information (CMI)-SMI and CMI-MSE regions to identify the performance bounds of ISAC systems in practical settings and reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing performances. Moreover, via analysis and numerical results, we provide two valuable insights into the design of novel ISAC-enabled systems: i) communication prefers the waveforms of random amplitude, sensing prefers the waveforms of constant amplitude, both communication and sensing favor the waveforms of low correlations with random phases; ii) There exists a linear positive proportional relationship between the allocated time-frequency resource and the achieved communication rate/sensing MSE.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO NOMA Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where each access point (AP) serves all the users with the aid of the RIS. We practically model the system by considering imperfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and employing imperfect successive interference cancellation at the users end. We first obtain the channel estimates using linear minimum mean square error approach considering the spatial correlation at the RIS and then derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression using the statistical CSI. We next formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the sum SE of the system. We first introduce a novel successive Quadratic Transform (successive-QT) algorithm to optimize the transmit power coefficients using the concept of block optimization along with quadratic transform and then use the particle swarm optimization technique to design the RIS phase shifts. Note that most of the existing works on RIS-aided cell-free systems are specific instances of the general scenario studied in this work. We numerically show that i) the RIS-assisted link is more advantageous at lower transmit power regions where the direct link between AP and user is weak, ii) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access schemes in terms of SE, and iii) the proposed joint optimization framework significantly improves the sum SE of the system.</description>

      <title>Biometric Authentication Based on Enhanced Remote Photoplethysmography Signal Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Real-time Timbre Remapping with Differentiable DSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre is a primary mode of expression in diverse musical contexts. However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how timbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method facilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral differences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.</description>

      <title>Wireless Spectrum in Rural Farmlands: Status, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to factors such as low population density and expansive geographical distances, network deployment falls behind in rural regions, leading to a broadband divide. Wireless spectrum serves as the blood and flesh of wireless communications. Shared white spaces such as those in the TVWS and CBRS spectrum bands offer opportunities to expand connectivity, innovate, and provide affordable access to high-speed Internet in under-served areas without additional cost to expensive licensed spectrum. However, the current methods to utilize these white spaces are inefficient due to very conservative models and spectrum policies, causing under-utilization of valuable spectrum resources. This hampers the full potential of innovative wireless technologies that could benefit farmers, small Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) operating in rural regions. This study explores the challenges faced by farmers and service providers when using shared spectrum bands to deploy their networks while ensuring maximum system performance and minimizing interference with other users. Additionally, we discuss how spatiotemporal spectrum models, in conjunction with database-driven spectrum-sharing solutions, can enhance the allocation and management of spectrum resources, ultimately improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless networks operating in shared spectrum bands.</description>

      <title>Channel State Acquisition in Uplink NOMA for Cellular-Connected UAV: Exploitation of Doppler and Modulation Diversities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance or monitoring applications into fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) cellular networks is an intriguing problem that has recently tackled a lot of interest in both academia and industry. For an efficient spectrum usage, we consider a recently-proposed sky-ground nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where a cellular-connected UAV acting as aerial user (AU) and a static terrestrial user (TU) are paired to simultaneously transmit their uplink signals to a base station (BS) in the same time-frequency resource blocks. In such a case, due to the highly dynamic nature of the UAV, the signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by Doppler shifts. On the other hand, for a static ground network, frequency dispersion of the signal transmitted by the TU is negligible and only multipath effects have to be taken into account. To decode the superposed signals at the BS through successive interference cancellation, accurate estimates of both the AU and TU channels are needed. In this paper, we propose channel estimation procedures that suitably exploit the different circular/noncircular modulation formats (modulation diversity) and the different almost-cyclostationarity features (Doppler diversity) of the AU and TU by means of widely-linear time-varying processing. Our estimation approach is semi-blind since Doppler shifts and time delays of the AU are estimated based on the received data only, whereas the remaining relevant parameters of the AU and TU channels are acquired relying also on the available training symbols, which are transmitted by the AU and TU in a nonorthogonal manner.</description>

      <title>Neuro-BERT: Rethinking Masked Autoencoding for Self-supervised Neurological Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning associated with neurological signals is poised to drive major advancements in diverse fields such as medical diagnostics, neurorehabilitation, and brain-computer interfaces. The challenge in harnessing the full potential of these signals lies in the dependency on extensive, high-quality annotated data, which is often scarce and expensive to acquire, requiring specialized infrastructure and domain expertise. To address the appetite for data in deep learning, we present Neuro-BERT, a self-supervised pre-training framework of neurological signals based on masked autoencoding in the Fourier domain. The intuition behind our approach is simple: frequency and phase distribution of neurological signals can reveal intricate neurological activities. We propose a novel pre-training task dubbed Fourier Inversion Prediction (FIP), which randomly masks out a portion of the input signal and then predicts the missing information using the Fourier inversion theorem. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for various downstream tasks such as sleep stage classification and gesture recognition. Unlike contrastive-based methods, which strongly rely on carefully hand-crafted augmentations and siamese structure, our approach works reasonably well with a simple transformer encoder with no augmentation requirements. By evaluating our method on several benchmark datasets, we show that Neuro-BERT improves downstream neurological-related tasks by a large margin.</description>

      <title>SwinJSCC: Taming Swin Transformer for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the key techniques to realize semantic communications, end-to-end optimized neural joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has made great progress over the past few years. A general trend in many recent works pushing the model adaptability or the application diversity of neural JSCC is based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone, whose model capacity is yet limited, inherently leading to inferior system coding gain against traditional coded transmission systems. In this paper, we establish a new neural JSCC backbone that can also adapt flexibly to diverse channel conditions and transmission rates within a single model, our open-source project aims to promote the research in this field. Specifically, we show that with elaborate design, neural JSCC codec built on the emerging Swin Transformer backbone achieves superior performance than conventional neural JSCC codecs built upon CNN, while also requiring lower end-to-end processing latency. Paired with two spatial modulation modules that scale latent representations based on the channel state information and target transmission rate, our baseline SwinJSCC can further upgrade to a versatile version, which increases its capability to adapt to diverse channel conditions and rate configurations. Extensive experimental results show that our SwinJSCC achieves better or comparable performance versus the state-of-the-art engineered BPG + 5G LDPC coded transmission system with much faster end-to-end coding speed, especially for high-resolution images, in which case traditional CNN-based JSCC yet falls behind due to its limited model capacity.</description>

Abstract: In this correspondence, we propose a joint mechanical and electrical adjustment of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the performance improvements of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In particular, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) MIMO channel model for the mechanically-tilted IRS in general deployment, and consider two types of scenarios with and without the direct path of LEO-ground user link due to the orbital flight. With the aim of maximizing the end-to-end performance, we jointly optimize tilting angle and phase shift of IRS along with the transceiver beamforming, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations with the Orbcomm LEO satellite using a real orbit data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate asset localization holds paramount importance across various industries, ranging from transportation management to search and rescue operations. In scenarios where traditional positioning equations cannot be adequately solved due to limited measurements obtained by the receiver, the utilization of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) based on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can prove pivotal for precise positioning. The decision to employ NTN in lieu of conventional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is rooted in two key factors. Firstly, GNSS systems are susceptible to jamming and spoofing attacks, thereby compromising their reliability, where LEO satellites link budgets can benefit from a closer distances and the new mega constellations could offer more satellites in view than GNSS. Secondly, 5G service providers seek to reduce dependence on third-party services. Presently, the NTN operation necessitates a GNSS receiver within the User Equipment (UE), placing the service provider at the mercy of GNSS reliability. Consequently, when GNSS signals are unavailable in certain regions, NTN services are also rendered inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Feature Characterization for Profile Surface Texture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional field parameters for surface measurement use all data points, while feature characterization focuses on subsets extracted by watershed segmentation. This approach enables the extraction of specific features that are potentially responsible for the function of the surface or are a direct reflection of the manufacturing process, allowing for a more accurate assessment of both aspects. Feature characterization with the underlying watershed segmentation for areal surface topographies has been standardized for over a decade and is well established in industry and research. In contrast, feature characterization for surface profiles has been standardized recently, and the corresponding standard for watershed segmentation is planned to be published in the near future. Since the standards do not provide guidelines for implementation, this paper presents an unambiguous algorithm of the watershed segmentation and the feature characterization for surface profiles. This framework provides the basis for future work, mainly investigating the relationship between feature parameters based on feature characterization and the function of the surface or manufacturing process. For this purpose, recommendations for the configuration and extensions of the toolbox can also be developed, which could find their way into the ISO standards.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of pilot-aided, uplink channel estimation in a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture, in which the access points are connected to a central processing unit via fiber-optical fronthaul links, carrying a two-level-quantized version of the received analog radio-frequency signal. We adapt to this architecture the deep-learning-based channel-estimation algorithm recently proposed by Nguyen et al. (2023), and explore its robustness to the additional signal distortions (beyond 1-bit quantization) introduced in the considered architecture by the automatic gain controllers (AGCs) and by the comparators. These components are used at the access points to generate the two-level analog waveform from the received signal. Via simulation results, we illustrate that the proposed channel-estimation method outperforms significantly the Bussgang linear minimum mean-square error channel estimator, and it is robust against the additional impairments introduced by the AGCs and the comparators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion tensor based cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) offers a non-invasive method to visualize the myocardial microstructure. With the assumption that the heart is stationary, frames are acquired with multiple repetitions for different diffusion encoding directions. However, motion from poor breath-holding and imprecise cardiac triggering complicates DT-CMR analysis, further challenged by its inherently low SNR, varied contrasts, and diffusion induced textures. Our solution is a novel framework employing groupwise registration with an implicit template to isolate respiratory and cardiac motions, while a tensor-embedded branch preserves diffusion contrast textures. We have devised a loss refinement tailored for non-linear least squares fitting and low SNR conditions. Additionally, we introduce new physics-based and clinical metrics for performance evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have captured significant interest from both academia and industry due to their impressive performance across various textual tasks. However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 $\pm$ 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 $\pm$ 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Rare Channel Conditions using Bayesian Statistics and Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the probability of rare channel conditions is a central challenge in ultra-reliable wireless communication, where random events, such as deep fades, can cause sudden variations in the channel quality. This paper proposes a sample-efficient framework for predicting the statistics of such events by utilizing spatial dependency between channel measurements acquired from various locations. The proposed framework combines radio maps with non-parametric models and extreme value theory (EVT) to estimate rare-event channel statistics under a Bayesian formulation. The framework can be applied to a wide range of problems in wireless communication and is exemplified by rate selection in ultra-reliable communications. Notably, besides simulated data, the proposed framework is also validated with experimental measurements. The results in both cases show that the Bayesian formulation provides significantly better results in terms of throughput compared to baselines that do not leverage measurements from surrounding locations. It is also observed that the models based on EVT are generally more accurate in predicting rare-event statistics than non-parametric models, especially when only a limited number of channel samples are available. Overall, the proposed methods can significantly reduce the number of measurements required to predict rare channel conditions and guarantee reliability.</description>

      <title>A Fast Multitaper Power Spectrum Estimation in Nonuniformly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonuniformly sampled signals are prevalent in real-world applications but pose a significant challenge when estimating their power spectra from a finite number of samples of a single realization. The optimal solution using Bronez Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (GPSS) is computationally intensive and thus impractical for large datasets. This paper presents a fast nonparametric method, MultiTaper NonUniform Fast Fourier Transform (MTNUFFT), capable of estimating power spectra with lower computational burden. The method first derives a set of optimal tapers via cubic spline interpolation on a nominal analysis band, and subsequently shifts these tapers to other analysis bands using NonUniform FFT (NUFFT). The estimated spectral power within the band is the average power at the outputs of the taper set. This algorithm eliminates the time-consuming computation for solving the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP), thus reducing the computational load from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N \log N + N \log(1/\epsilon))$, comparable with the NUFFT. The statistical properties of the estimator are assessed using Bronez GPSS theory, revealing that the bias and variance bound of the MTNUFFT estimator are identical to those of the optimal estimator. Furthermore, the degradation of bias bound can serve as a measure of the deviation from optimality. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using both simulation and real-world data, demonstrating its practical applicability. The code of the proposed fast algorithm is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jiecui/mtnufft).</description>

      <title>Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized F-RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Formal Safety Guarantees via Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box zero-th order optimization is a central primitive for applications in fields as diverse as finance, physics, and engineering. In a common formulation of this problem, a designer sequentially attempts candidate solutions, receiving noisy feedback on the value of each attempt from the system. In this paper, we study scenarios in which feedback is also provided on the safety of the attempted solution, and the optimizer is constrained to limit the number of unsafe solutions that are tried throughout the optimization process. Focusing on methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO), prior art has introduced an optimization scheme -- referred to as SAFEOPT -- that is guaranteed not to select any unsafe solution with a controllable probability over feedback noise as long as strict assumptions on the safety constraint function are met. In this paper, a novel BO-based approach is introduced that satisfies safety requirements irrespective of properties of the constraint function. This strong theoretical guarantee is obtained at the cost of allowing for an arbitrary, controllable but non-zero, rate of violation of the safety constraint. The proposed method, referred to as SAFE-BOCP, builds on online conformal prediction (CP) and is specialized to the cases in which feedback on the safety constraint is either noiseless or noisy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed SAFE-BOCP.</description>

      <title>Joint Angle and Delay Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound Optimization for ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) beamforming design in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which an ISAC base station (BS) is used to communicate with multiple downlink users and simultaneously the communication signals are reused for sensing multiple targets. Our interested sensing parameters are the angle and delay information of the targets, which can be used to locate these targets. Under this consideration, we first derive the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint angle and delay estimation. Then, we optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS to minimize the CRB, subject to the communication rate requirement and the maximum transmit power constraint. In particular, we obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the case of single-target and single-user, and in the case of multi-target and multi-user scenario, the sparsity of the optimal solution is proven, leading to a reduction in computational complexity during optimization. The numerical results demonstrate that the optimized beamforming yields excellent positioning performance and effectively reduces the requirement for a large number of antennas at the BS.</description>

      <title>MT-HCCAR: Multi-Task Deep Learning with Hierarchical Classification and Attention-based Regression for Cloud Property Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of Earth science, effective cloud property retrieval, encompassing cloud masking, cloud phase classification, and cloud optical thickness (COT) prediction, remains pivotal. Traditional methodologies necessitate distinct models for each sensor instrument due to their unique spectral characteristics. Recent strides in Earth Science research have embraced machine learning and deep learning techniques to extract features from satellite datasets' spectral observations. However, prevailing approaches lack novel architectures accounting for hierarchical relationships among retrieval tasks. Moreover, considering the spectral diversity among existing sensors, the development of models with robust generalization capabilities over different sensor datasets is imperative. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of methodologies addressing the selection of an optimal model for diverse datasets. In response, this paper introduces MT-HCCAR, an end-to-end deep learning model employing multi-task learning to simultaneously tackle cloud masking, cloud phase retrieval (classification tasks), and COT prediction (a regression task). The MT-HCCAR integrates a hierarchical classification network (HC) and a classification-assisted attention-based regression network (CAR), enhancing precision and robustness in cloud labeling and COT prediction. Additionally, a comprehensive model selection method rooted in K-fold cross-validation, one standard error rule, and two introduced performance scores is proposed to select the optimal model over three simulated satellite datasets OCI, VIIRS, and ABI. The experiments comparing MT-HCCAR with baseline methods, the ablation studies, and the model selection affirm the superiority and the generalization capabilities of MT-HCCAR.</description>

      <title>Behavior Forests: Real-Time Discovery of Dynamic Behavior for Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Driving Systems (ADS) development relies on utilizing real-world vehicle data. The volume of data generated by modern vehicles presents transmission, storage, and computational challenges. Focusing on Dynamic Behavior (DB) offers a promising approach to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information for ADS functionalities, thereby reducing data. Time series pattern recognition is beneficial for this task as it can analyze the temporal context of vehicle driving behavior. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often lack the adaptability to identify variable-length patterns or provide analytical descriptions of discovered patterns. This contribution proposes a Behavior Forest framework for real-time data selection by constructing a Behavior Graph during vehicle operation, facilitating analytical descriptions without pre-training. The method demonstrates its performance using a synthetically generated and electrocardiogram data set. An automotive time series data set is used to evaluate the data reduction capabilities, in which this method discarded 96.01% of the incoming data stream, while relevant DB remain included.</description>
