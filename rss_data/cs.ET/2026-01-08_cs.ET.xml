      <title>On-Device Deep Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Task Offloading Performance trade-offs in the training process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allowing less capable devices to offload computational tasks to more powerful devices or servers enables the development of new applications that may not run correctly on the device itself. Deciding where and why to run each of those applications is a complex task. Therefore, different approaches have been adopted to make offloading decisions. In this work, we propose a decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to address the selection of computing locations. Unlike most existing work, we analyze it in a real testbed composed of various edge devices running the agent to determine where to execute each task. These devices are connected to a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) server and a Cloud server through 5G communications. We evaluate not only the agent's performance in meeting task requirements but also the implications of running this type of agent locally, assessing the trade-offs of training locally versus remotely in terms of latency and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fault-tolerant Cat State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cat states are an important resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where they serve as building blocks for a variety of fault-tolerant primitives. Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of a UAV-Mounted LEO Satellite Backhaul for Emergency Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable connectivity is critical for Public Protection and Disaster Relief operations, especially in rural or compromised environments where terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. In such scenarios, NTNs, and specifically UAVs, are promising candidates to provide on-demand and rapid connectivity on the ground, serving as aerial base stations. In this paper, we implement a setup in which a rotary-wing UAV, equipped with a Starlink Mini terminal, provides Internet connectivity to an emergency ground user in the absence of cellular coverage via LEO satellites. The UAV functions as a Wi-Fi access point, while backhauling the ground traffic through the Starlink constellation. We evaluate the system via both network simulations in ns-3 and real-world flight experiments in a rural environment, in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, and energy consumption under static and dynamic flight conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable uplink throughput of approximately 30 Mbps up to approximately 200 meters, and with minimal impact on the UAV battery lifetime. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying commercial LEO satellite terminals on UAVs as a practical solution for emergency connectivity.</description>

      <title>Building Network Digital Twins Part II: Real-Time Adaptive PID for Enhanced State Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we evolve towards more heterogeneous and cutting-edge mobile networks, Network Digital Twins (NDTs) are proving to be a promising paradigm in solving challenges faced by network operators, as they give a possibility of replicating the physical network operations and testing scenarios separately without interfering with the live network. However, with mobile networks becoming increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous due to massive device connectivity, replicating traffic and having NDTs synchronized in real-time with the physical network remains a challenge, thus necessitating the need to develop real-time adaptive mechanisms to bridge this gap. In this part II of our work, we implement a novel framework that integrates an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically improve synchronization. Additionally, through an interactive user interface, results of our enhanced approach demonstrate an improvement in real-time traffic synchronization.</description>
