      <title>How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) or (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moir\'e systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and physical properties of the Kagome metal UNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $RM_6X_6$ family of materials ($R$ = rare-earth, $M$ = transition metal, $X$ = Ga, Si, Ge, Sn) produces an array of emergent phenomena, such as charge density waves, intrinsic Hall effects, and complex magnetic order, due to its Kagome net of transition metal atoms, its local-moment magnetic anisotropies, and its extensive chemical tunability. Here, we report a new ``166" material containing both an actinide (uranium) and a 4$d$ transition metal (niobium) to investigate the properties of a 5$f$-4$d$ electron 166 system. UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in the hexagonal $P$6/$mmm$ space group with a small degree of disorder due to shifts in the size of the CoSn-like cages along the $c$ axis. Upon cooling at zero magnetic field, the material undergoes two magnetic phase transitions at $T_\mathrm{2}$ = 46 K and $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 43 K. The low-temperature, zero-field phase is an antiferromagnet with ordered uranium moments and a $\textbf{k}$=(0,0,1/2) propagation vector determined by neutron diffraction. Remarkably, with a magnetic field applied along the $c$ axis, five additional magnetic transitions occur, evidenced by magnetization and resistivity data, before the moment saturates at 2.62 ${\mu}_{\mathrm{B}}$/U at 2 K and $\ge$13.6 T. In two magnetic phase regions, the Hall resistivity of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ significantly deviates from the magnetization, suggesting that the phases have a large Berry curvature or a change in the Fermi surface. The unknown magnetic ordering of the field-dependent phases of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ demonstrates the complexity of the 5$f$-4$d$ 166 system and encourages further study of its properties.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of residual electron pairing in the extended-Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electron addition spectrum of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (HSSH) model in the dilute limit using the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the expected renormalization to the band structure, we find that the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction produces an anomalous spectral feature when electrons are added in the singlet channel but which is absent in the triplet channel. By comparing these results with those obtained from perturbation theory in the antiadiabatic limit, we demonstrate that this anomalous feature is a remnant of the strong electron-electron interaction mediated by the SSH coupling previously derived in the two-particle limit. By studying the evolution of this feature as a function of doping, we track the fate of this attraction to higher carrier concentrations and provide predictions for the spectral features to help guide future searches for strong e-ph mediated pairing.</description>

      <title>Design of altermagnetic models from spin clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-band fractional Thouless pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization of particle transport lies at the heart of topological physics. In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Electron Transport in Compacted Powders of VO2 Nanoparticles: Variable Range Hopping vs Percolation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transport properties in compacted VO2 nanopowders were studied. While VO2 usually exhibits a first-order metal-insulator transition (MIT) at ~340K, in our compressed nanopowder samples the MIT was significantly broadened due to structural disorder, interparticle barriers, and phase coexistence. Resistivity measurements in the temperature range of 78 - 682 K initially suggested a variable range hopping (VRH) transport mechanism, but further analysis indicates that the observed temperature dependence is governed by percolative conductivity, modified by activation-assisted tunneling effects. Suppression of the expected resistance jump at the MIT is attributed to dynamic intergranular barrier restructuring, residual localized states, and percolative electron transport. These findings highlight the necessity of considering percolation effects when analyzing transport mechanisms in granular VO2-based systems.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of three-dimensional stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize several three-dimensional Z2 stabilizer models--including the X-cube model, the three-dimensional toric code, and Haah's code--to their ZN counterparts. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analyze their ground state degeneracies and topological excitations, and uncover behaviors that strongly depend on system size. For the X-cube model, we identify excitations with mobility restricted under local operations but relaxed under nonlocal ones derived from global topology. These excitations, previously confined to open boundaries in the Z2 model, now appear even under periodic boundaries. In the toric code, we observe nontrivial braiding between string and point excitations despite the absence of ground state degeneracy, indicating long-range entanglement independent of topological degeneracy. Again, this effect extends from open to periodic boundaries in the generalized models. For Haah's code, we find new excitations--fracton tripoles and monopoles--that remain globally constrained, along with a relaxation of immobility giving rise to lineons and planons. These results reveal new forms of topological order and suggest a broader framework for understanding fracton phases beyond the conventional Z2 setting.</description>

      <title>Deconfined Quantum Critical Point: A Review of Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) have been proposed as a class of continuous quantum phase transitions occurring between two ordered phases with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, beyond the conventional framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory. At the DQCP, the system exhibits emergent gauge fields, fractionalized excitations, and enhanced symmetries. Here we review recent theoretical and experimental progress on exploring DQCPs in condensed matter systems. We first introduce theoretical advancements in the study of DQCPs over the past twenty years, particularly in magnetic models on square lattices, honeycomb lattices, kagome lattices, and one-dimensional spin chains. We then discuss recent progress on experimental realization of DQCP in quantum magnetic systems. Experimentally, the Shastry-Sutherland model, realized in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, offers a particularly promising platform for realizing DQCPs. The magnetic frustration inherent to this model drives phase transitions between two distinct symmetry-breaking states: a valence bond solid (VBS) phase and a N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic phase. Remarkably, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has provided the first experimental evidence of a proximate DQCP through a field-induced Bose-Einstein condensation, transitioning from the VBS state to the N\'{e}el state. Nevertheless, the direct experimental realization of a DQCP remains a significant challenge. Despite this, it offers a promising platform for exploring emergent phenomena through quantum phase transition in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic interactions in Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and the formation of skyrmion phases in centrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive X-ray and neutron scattering study of the structure and magnetic excitations of Nd$_2$PdSi$_3$, a sister compound of Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ which was recently found to host a skyrmion lattice phase despite its centrosymmetric crystal structure. Dispersive magnetic excitations were measured throughout the Brillouin zone and modelled using mean-field random-phase approximation to determine the magnetic interactions between Nd ions. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic interactions in this system extend over large distances and are significantly affected by a crystallographic superstructure formed by ordering of the Pd and Si atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism for the skyrmion phase formation in this family of materials, e.g. Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ is through the long-range RKKY interactions rather than short-range triangular-lattice frustration.</description>

      <title>Giant and anisotropic magnetostriction in $\beta$-O$_{2}$ at 110 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetostriction is a crystal's deformation under magnetic fields, usually in the range of $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-3}$, where the lattice change occurs with the change of spin and orbital state through spin-lattice couplings. In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction. However, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging, because generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of the coil with a single-shot $\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal of $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator. The magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the unit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating, not only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but also the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network. Meanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the spin system. Giant magnetostriction in crystals should become more ubiquitous and diverse beyond 100 T, where our XFEL experiment above 100 T opens a novel pathway for their exploration, providing fundamental insights into the roles of spin in stabilizing crystal structures.</description>

      <title>$t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Orbital orders under magnetic fields in cubic PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.</description>

      <title>Large magnetoreflectance and optical anisotropy due to $4f$ flat bands in the frustrated kagome magnet HoAgGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report peculiar optical properties of the frustrated itinerant magnet HoAgGe, which exhibits multiple magnetically ordered states obeying the kagome spin-ice rule. The optical conductivity is surprisingly higher for light polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane, both for the free carrier response and the interband transitions. The latter ones have strong contributions from Ho $4f$ flat bands located near the Fermi level, as revealed by our \textit{ab initio} calculations, explaining the unusual anisotropy of the optical properties and the pronounced temperature dependence of the interband transitions for out--of--plane light polarization. The key role of Ho $4f$ states is further supported by the large variation of the reflectivity upon the metamagnetic transitions, that follows the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that of the dc magnetotransport data. Such heavy-electron bands near the Fermi level offer an efficient way to control transport and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[79, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[374, 10, 13]]$, $[[409, 11, 13]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Non-Dissipative Inertial Dynamics of Skyrmion in a Bosonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ''minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Encoding of Pre-trained MPS Classifiers into Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry from the Moyal product: quantum kinetic equation and non-linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the dissipationless quantum kinetic equation for a multi-band free fermionic system with U(1) symmetry. Using the Moyal product formalism, we fully band-diagonalize the dynamics. Expanding to the second order in gradients, which is beyond the semiclassical limit, we give a complete analysis of the band-resolved thermodynamics and transport properties, especially those arising from the quantum geometric tensor. We apply our framework to a Bloch band theory under electric fields near equilibrium and find the linear and nonlinear transport coefficients. We also obtain the dynamical density-density response functions in the metallic case, including quantum metric corrections. Our results and approach can be applied very generally to multi-band problems even in situations with spatially varying Hamiltonians and distributions.</description>

      <title>Equilibration of Topological Defects Near the Deconfined Quantum Multicritical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) arises from fractionalization of quasi-particles and leads to fascinating behaviors beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson description of phase transitions. Here, we study the critical dynamics when driving a two-dimensional quantum magnet through a weakly first-order transition point near a putative deconfined multicritical point separating antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. Numerical simulations show that the conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) mechanism is inadequate for describing the annealing process. We introduce the concept of dual asymmetric KZS, where both a pseudocritical relaxation time and the deconfinement time enter and the scaling also depends on the driving direction according to a duality principle connecting the topological defects in the two phases. These defects require a much longer time scale for equilibration than the amplitude of the order parameter. Beyond advancing the DQC scenario, our scaling approach provides a new window into out-of-equilibrium criticality with multiple length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Observation of Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical spectra of an organic antiferromagnet as a candidate for an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for an altermagnet. From the Maxwell equations, we derived matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses of $\kappa$-Cl. The MOKE of $\kappa$-Cl appeared at around the N\'eel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These nonlinear field dependence eliminates a simple origin due to the net canted magnetization. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows three features. One is the large peaks at the spectral ends due to the magnetic origin with the large energy scale compared to the very small spin-orbit interaction in $\kappa$-Cl. The others are the middle region spectra proportional to the diagonal conductivities, possibly related to the symmetric piezomagnetic effect and the standard antisymmetric origins. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of $\kappa$-Cl. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and the net magnetization and N\'eel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.</description>

      <title>Finite Correlation Length Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been discovered in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this observation, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in driving flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, and in stabilizing superconductivity mediated by repulsive interactions. Though mean-field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Using this formalism, we find superconductivity arising from the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron dopings. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a p-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal-symmetry-broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. We establish a universal rule governing the generation of Hopf terms in 2D quantum spin systems coupled to Dirac fermions. The key insight identifies the Hopf coefficient as the oriented volume in the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra space formed by Dirac cone matrix bases. This geometric interpretation allows direct determination of Hopf term without path integral computations. Applying this framework, we demonstrate nontrivial Hopf term in tailored checkerboard lattice models and recover known results in graphene-based systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model via Krylov spread complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the $\mathcal{PT}$-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto engine mimicking Carnot near pseudotransitions in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (EHM) in the atomic limit has recently been found to exhibit a curious thermal pseudo-transition behavior, which closely resembles first and second-order thermal phase transitions. This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Detecting Thermodynamic Phase Transition via Explainable Machine Learning of Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying thermodynamic signatures of electronic phases, such as superconductivity, is challenging in low-dimensional materials due to strong fluctuations and low probing volume. Spectroscopic methods are often used to identify new bulk phases, but their main measurable quantity -- electronic energy gaps -- is no longer an effective order parameter in low-dimensional and fluctuating systems. Combining angle-resolved photoemission with a domain-adversarial neural network, we report a data-driven method to identify thermodynamic phase transitions solely based on single-particle spectra. We demonstrate 97.6$\%$ accuracy in cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ with strong superconducting fluctuations. This model notably compensates for the scarcity of experimental data by leveraging virtually inexhaustible simulated data. Further, its explainability reveals the crucial role of in-gap spectral weight in detecting phase fluctuations and thermodynamic transitions. Our work pinpoints the spectroscopic signatures of fluctuating orders and enables using spectroscopy for machine-learning-assisted material discovery for low-dimensional and strong coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which is difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflect scaling dimensions of individual field operators. This disentangling is demonstrated explicitly for conformal field theories. The scheme is first tested on the critical point of the 2D Ising model, where the two primary scaling dimensions and their respective two lowest descendant dimensions are extracted. The 3D Ising model is studied next, revealing the two relevant primaries and their lowest descendants to high precision. The 2D tricritical Ising point is studied with the Blume-Capel model. Here the scaling dimensions of all three symmetric primary operators are successfully isolated along with the leading descendants. The eigenvectors are also studied and give useful information on the boundary between the ordered and disordered phases in the neighborhood of the tricritical point. Finally, the crossover from regular to tricritical Ising scaling is investigated on several points on the phase boundary of the Blume-Capel model away from its tricritical point. The scaling of the eigenvalues corresponding to tricritical descendant operators are found to be remarkably stable even far from the tricritical point. The covariance method represents a simple extension of standard analysis of correlation functions and can significantly enhance the utility of Monte Carlo simulations and other computational methods in studies of criticality, in particular conformal critical points.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a strongly coupled finite-density anisotropic fluid in $2+1$ dimensions dual to an asymptotically AdS black brane that is a solution of Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in $3+1$ dimensions. Despite the anisotropy, the fluid thermodynamic properties align with those of a conformal fluid. Moreover, we show that the fluid is stable under the increase of the anisotropy parameter. Additionally, we analyse the DC conductivity of the anisotropic fluid, showing its compatibility with momentum dissipation due to translational symmetry breaking. In the limit of very large anisotropy we find that the DC conductivity vanishes as a consequence of dimensionality reduction. We also find that a metal-insulator transition arises driven by the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of magnetization-induced band renormalization and strong spin-charge-lattice coupling in EuZn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</description>

Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum magnetism at the frontier of classical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor artificial graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms. We determine effective Hubbard model parameters and identify the magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>
