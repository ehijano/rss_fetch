      <title>Unlocking Potential Binders: Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion for Denoising DNA-Encoded Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of drug discovery, DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening technology has emerged as an efficient method for identifying high-affinity compounds. However, DEL screening faces a significant challenge: noise arising from nonspecific interactions within complex biological systems. Neural networks trained on DEL libraries have been employed to extract compound features, aiming to denoise the data and uncover potential binders to the desired therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the inherent structure of DEL, constrained by the limited diversity of building blocks, impacts the performance of compound encoders. Moreover, existing methods only capture compound features at a single level, further limiting the effectiveness of the denoising strategy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion model (MPDF) that enhances encoder capabilities through pretraining and integrates compound features across various scales. We develop pretraining tasks applying contrastive objectives between different compound representations and their text descriptions, enhancing the compound encoders' ability to acquire generic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel DEL-fusion framework that amalgamates compound information at the atomic, submolecular, and molecular levels, as captured by various compound encoders. The synergy of these innovations equips MPDF with enriched, multi-scale features, enabling comprehensive downstream denoising. Evaluated on three DEL datasets, MPDF demonstrates superior performance in data processing and analysis for validation tasks. Notably, MPDF offers novel insights into identifying high-affinity molecules, paving the way for improved DEL utility in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>DeepFM-Crispr: Prediction of CRISPR On-Target Effects via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of CRISPR-Cas9, a groundbreaking gene-editing technology that enables precise genomic modifications via a short RNA guide sequence, there has been a marked increase in the accessibility and application of this technology across various fields. The success of CRISPR-Cas9 has spurred further investment and led to the discovery of additional CRISPR systems, including CRISPR-Cas13. Distinct from Cas9, which targets DNA, Cas13 targets RNA, offering unique advantages for gene modulation. We focus on Cas13d, a variant known for its collateral activity where it non-specifically cleaves adjacent RNA molecules upon activation, a feature critical to its function. We introduce DeepFM-Crispr, a novel deep learning model developed to predict the on-target efficiency and evaluate the off-target effects of Cas13d. This model harnesses a large language model to generate comprehensive representations rich in evolutionary and structural data, thereby enhancing predictions of RNA secondary structures and overall sgRNA efficacy. A transformer-based architecture processes these inputs to produce a predictive efficacy score. Comparative experiments show that DeepFM-Crispr not only surpasses traditional models but also outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of prediction accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Understanding how chromatin folding and enzyme competition affect rugged epigenetic landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epigenetics plays a key role in cellular differentiation and maintaining cell identity, enabling cells to regulate their genetic activity without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation occurs within the context of hierarchically folded chromatin, yet the interplay between the dynamics of epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture remains poorly understood. In addition, it remains unclear what mechanisms drive the formation of rugged epigenetic patterns, characterised by alternating genomic regions enriched in activating and repressive marks. In this study, we focus on post-translational modifications of histone H3 tails, particularly H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. We introduce a mesoscopic stochastic model that incorporates chromatin architecture and competition of histone-modifying enzymes into the dynamics of epigenetic modifications in small genomic loci comprising several nucleosomes. Our approach enables us to investigate the mechanisms by which epigenetic patterns form on larger scales of chromatin organisation, such as loops and domains. Through bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce uniform chromatin states (open, closed, and bivalent) and generate previously unexplored rugged profiles. Our results suggest that enzyme competition and chromatin conformations with high-frequency interactions between distant genomic loci can drive the emergence of rugged epigenetic landscapes. Additionally, we hypothesise that bivalent chromatin can act as an intermediate state, facilitating transitions between uniform and rugged landscapes. This work offers a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation, providing new insights into the formation of complex epigenetic patterns.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical novel class discovery for single-cell transcriptomic profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major challenges arising from single-cell transcriptomics experiments is the question of how to annotate the associated single-cell transcriptomic profiles. Because of the large size and the high dimensionality of the data, automated methods for annotation are needed. We focus here on datasets obtained in the context of developmental biology, where the differentiation process leads to a hierarchical structure. We consider a frequent setting where both labeled and unlabeled data are available at training time, but the sets of the labels of labeled data on one side and of the unlabeled data on the other side, are disjoint. It is an instance of the Novel Class Discovery problem. The goal is to achieve two objectives, clustering the data and mapping the clusters with labels. We propose extensions of k-Means and GMM clustering methods for solving the problem and report comparative results on artificial and experimental transcriptomic datasets. Our approaches take advantage of the hierarchical nature of the data.</description>

      <title>PharmacoMatch: Efficient 3D Pharmacophore Screening through Neural Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of screening libraries poses a significant challenge for the development of virtual screening methods for drug discovery, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional approaches in the era of big data. Although 3D pharmacophore screening remains a prevalent technique, its application to very large datasets is limited by the computational cost associated with matching query pharmacophores to database ligands. In this study, we introduce PharmacoMatch, a novel contrastive learning approach based on neural subgraph matching. Our method reinterprets pharmacophore screening as an approximate subgraph matching problem and enables efficient querying of conformational databases by encoding query-target relationships in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the learned representations and benchmark our method on virtual screening datasets in a zero-shot setting. Our findings demonstrate significantly shorter runtimes for pharmacophore matching, offering a promising speed-up for screening very large datasets.</description>

      <title>Enzyme kinetic reactions as interacting particle systems: Stochastic averaging and parameter inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of multistage Michaelis--Menten (MM) type enzyme kinetic reactions describing the conversion of substrate molecules to a product through several intermediate species. The high-dimensional, multiscale nature of these reaction networks presents significant computational challenges, especially in statistical estimation of reaction rates. This difficulty is amplified when direct data on system states are unavailable, and one only has access to a random sample of product formation times. To address this, we proceed in two stages. First, under certain technical assumptions akin to those made in the Quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) literature, we prove two asymptotic results: a stochastic averaging principle that yields a lower-dimensional model, and a functional central limit theorem that quantifies the associated fluctuations. Next, for statistical inference of the parameters of the original MM reaction network, we develop a mathematical framework involving an interacting particle system (IPS) and prove a propagation of chaos result that allows us to write a product-form likelihood function. The novelty of the IPS-based inference method is that it does not require information about the state of the system and works with only a random sample of product formation times. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the efficacy of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>DANCE: Deep Learning-Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced Kaleidoscopic Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. T cell receptors (TCRs), crucial proteins in the immune system, play a key role in recognizing antigens, including those associated with cancer. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have facilitated comprehensive profiling of TCR repertoires, uncovering TCRs with potent anti-cancer activity and enabling TCR-based immunotherapies. However, analyzing these intricate biomolecules necessitates efficient representations that capture their structural and functional information. T-cell protein sequences pose unique challenges due to their relatively smaller lengths compared to other biomolecules. An image-based representation approach becomes a preferred choice for efficient embeddings, allowing for the preservation of essential details and enabling comprehensive analysis of T-cell protein sequences. In this paper, we propose to generate images from the protein sequences using the idea of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) using the Kaleidoscopic images approach. This Deep Learning Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced Kaleidoscopic Images (called DANCE) provides a unique way to visualize protein sequences by recursively applying chaos game rules around a central seed point. we perform the classification of the T cell receptors (TCRs) protein sequences in terms of their respective target cancer cells, as TCRs are known for their immune response against cancer disease. The TCR sequences are converted into images using the DANCE method. We employ deep-learning vision models to perform the classification to obtain insights into the relationship between the visual patterns observed in the generated kaleidoscopic images and the underlying protein properties. By combining CGR-based image generation with deep learning classification, this study opens novel possibilities in the protein analysis domain.</description>

      <title>Infer metabolic fluxes from moment differences of mass-weighted concentration distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metabolic pathways are fundamental maps in biochemistry that detail how molecules are transformed through various reactions. The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic direction changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic direction changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: mass-weighted concentration distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the concentrations of metabolites times their associated molecular weights. By estimating the differences of the location and scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to infer the metabolic direction and magnitude changes without requiring knowledge of the exact chemical structures of these compounds and their related pathways.</description>

      <title>Matrix dissimilarities based on differences in moments and sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating a dissimilarity matrix is typically the first step in big data analysis. Although numerous methods exist, such as Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, Manhattan distance, Bray Curtis dissimilarity, Jaccard similarity and Dice dissimilarity, it remains unclear which factors drive dissimilarity between groups. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on differences in moments and sparsity. We show that this method can delineate the key factors underlying group differences. For example, in biology, mean dissimilarity indicates differences driven by up down regulated gene expressions, standard deviation dissimilarity reflects the heterogeneity of response to treatment, and sparsity dissimilarity corresponds to differences prompted by the activation silence of genes. Through extensive reanalysis of genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, immune profiling, microbiome, and social science datasets, we demonstrate insights not captured in previous studies. For instance, it shows that the sparsity dissimilarity is as effective as the mean dissimilarity in predicting the alleviation effects of a COVID 19 drug, suggesting that sparsity dissimilarity is highly meaningful.</description>

      <title>CRADLE-VAE: Enhancing Single-Cell Gene Perturbation Modeling with Counterfactual Reasoning-based Artifact Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to various perturbations is a critical focus in drug discovery and personalized therapeutics, with deep learning models playing a significant role in this endeavor. Single-cell datasets contain technical artifacts that may hinder the predictability of such models, which poses quality control issues highly regarded in this area. To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well. The CRADLE-VAE codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CRADLE-VAE.</description>
