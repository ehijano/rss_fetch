      <title>Effect of size dependent strain at various coverage on island formation: Kinetic Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is an epitaxy method for thin film deposition of single crystals. MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including transistors, and it is considered one of the fundamental tools for the development of the nanotechnologies. We have used Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation technique to study the crystal growth during Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). KMC is used to simulate the physical phenomena in which the probable events are selected by using pseudo random numbers. In this work, we have studied the effect of strain at various fixed coverage values, with the model which includes varying strain-driven detachment on average island morphology, average island density, relative width distribution and island size distributions. Our simulation results demonstrate that growth on a patterned impurity surface with inclusion of varying strain-driven detachment resulted in improvement the spatial ordering on island morphologies and the size distribution of the islands.</description>

      <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cell Stability: Dual Protection with Ultrathin Plasma Polymer Passivation Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite solar cells (MHPSCs) hold great promise related to their high efficiency and low fabrication costs, but their long-term stability under environmental conditions remains a major challenge. In this study, we demonstrate an effective protection strategy to enhance the stability of MHPSCs through the incorporation of a double passivation layer based on an adamantane-based plasma polymer (ADA) at both the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces. Our results show that the implemented ADA deposition technique is compatible with delicate substrates such as perovskites thin films, as their optical, morphological and optoelectronic properties are unaltered upon ADA deposition. At the same time, it provides effective protection to the perovskite material in high humidity environments. The ADA-double passivation not only reduces the formation of mobile ionic defects that cause additional recombination, but also significantly reduces humidity-induced degradation and mitigates the photocatalytic degradation caused by TiO2 under UV exposure. Stability tests performed under 100% relative humidity and continuous AM 1.5G illumination (ISOS-L-1) show that ADA dual passivated devices retained 80% of their initial efficiency after 4000 minutes, while reference samples dropped to 30%. The enhanced performance of ADA-passivated cells is attributed to protective nature of the plasma polymer layer resulting in a preservation of photocurrent and the prevention of new recombination routes. This dual passivation strategy offers a promising route to improve the environmental stability of PSCs and extend their operational lifetime.</description>

      <title>Spin waves in Co$_2$FeGe films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic magnetic properties of Full Heusler alloy thin films of Co$_2$FeGe, grown on MgO (001) substrates under different thermal conditions, were investigated. Brillouin light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance measurements revealed that depositing at room temperature followed by annealing at 300 deg C for 1 hour produces the best results for maximizing magnetization, exchange stiffness, and minimizing spin-dynamic dissipation in the films, which are desirable characteristics for high-speed spintronic devices. Additionally, strong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed, which is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.</description>

      <title>Interplay between interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy in 4d transition metal multilayers for skyrmion nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions refer to small swirling spin structures that emerge in ferromagnetic materials and show promising features to be used as a `bit' of information in future spintronic devices. Our research explores the possibility of nucleating skyrmions in X-Fe/Ir(111) multilayer nano-structure where, X is one of the 4d transition metals, such as, Pd, Rh, Ru, Mo and Nb. The resulting final state is determined by the competition between the frustrated exchange interaction, primarily contributed by the top 4d transition metal layer, and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced significantly by the 5d heavy metal Ir(111) layer. We apply a perpendicular dc magnetic field to the nano-structure and observe gradual phase transformation from the spin spiral ground state to a stable relaxed state of nano-scale skyrmions . A proper choice of magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to a range of external magnetic fields essential for the existence and stability of skyrmions. By raising the temperature, we assess the thermal stability of the nucleated skyrmions to evaluate their potential as information carriers in future spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Inverse Rashba-Edelstein THz emission modulation induced by ferroelectricity in CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2//LiNbO3 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic-assisted liquid phase exfoliation for high-yield monolayer graphene with enhanced crystallinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene stands as a promising material with vast potential across energy storage, electronics, etc. Here, we present a novel mechanical approach utilizing ultrasonic high-energy intercalation exfoliation to extract monolayer graphene from graphite, offering a simple yet efficient alternative to conventional methods. Through a comprehensive series of characterizations involving atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the resulting graphene nanosheets demonstrate superior crystallinity compared to those obtained via the conventional method. The high-crystalline freestanding graphene nanosheets derived from this method not only facilitate easier separation but also significantly enhance the physical performance of the original materials. This method showcases the potential for scalable production of layered materials with increased yield and crystallinity, paving the way for their utilization in various applications.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic collinear antiferromagnet with hidden altermagnetic split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>An ab-initio study on engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in compensated antiferromagnet MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of Mn3+xSn1-x Epitaxial Thin Films: Extending the Anomalous Hall Effect to Low Temperatures via Intrinsic Alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as Mn3Sn, have emerged as promising platforms for exploring topological and correlated electron physics. Mn3Sn is known to show two magnetic phase transitions: a non-collinear inverse triangular antiferromagnetic (IT-AFM) spin configuration is formed below its Neel temperature, whereas at T1 that usually locates below room temperature, it transits to an incommensurate spin state. Accordingly, intriguing properties such as a strong anomalous Hall effect, observed from TN to T1, disappear below T1, limiting its utility at low temperatures. While bulk Mn3Sn has been extensively studied, the magnetic phase transitions and their tunability in thin films remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the magnetic and magneto-transport properties of Mn3+xSn1-x epitaxial thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering, systematically varying the Mn-Sn composition. Our results reveal that intrinsic alloying with Mn provides us with a handle to tune T1, with the IT-AFM phase stabilized down to liquid helium temperatures for x &gt; 0.15. From a magnetic phase diagram for epitaxial thin films, we also find a consistent magnetic anomaly ~55 K below TN, accompanied by thermal hysteresis. Furthermore, the reduction of TN in thin films relative to bulk values is shown to correlate with lattice parameter changes. These findings extend the accessible temperature range for Mn3Sn's topological properties, paving the way for novel applications and further investigations into the interplay of spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom in thin-film geometries.</description>

      <title>Impact of Doping Spiro-OMeTAD with Li-TFSI, FK209, and tBP on the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the effects of doping Spiro-OMeTAD, a widely employed hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells, with three distinct impurities: lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), FK209, and tertbutylpyridine (tBP). The focus lies on their influence on critical photovoltaic parameters, including Fill Factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (eta), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Employing advanced simulation tools, we systematically compare the performance of undoped and doped Spiro-OMeTAD structures. Among the examined dopants, Li-TFSI exhibits the most pronounced enhancements, significantly improving both FF and efficiency. In contrast, FK209 and tBP yield moderate gains in device performance. These results underscore the superior charge transport properties imparted by Li-TFSI doping and its capacity to optimize HTM functionality, thereby presenting a promising approach to advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells</description>

      <title>Actively-trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials reproduce mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties of paramagnetic CrN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for automated fitting of magnetic Moment Tensor Potential explicitly including magnetic moments in its functional form. For the fitting of this potential we use energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) of configurations selected with an active learning algorithm. These selected configurations are computed using constrained density functional theory, which enables calculating energies and their derivatives for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (excited) magnetic states. We test our protocol on the system of B1-CrN and demonstrate that the automatically trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potential reproduces mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties, of B1-CrN in the paramagnetic state with respect to density functional theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Luminescence of the Cs2ZrCl6 under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminescence and Raman spectra of the Cs2ZrCl6 crystal in a wide range of pressures were studied in this work for the first time. Luminescence measurements were performed up to 10 GPa, while the Raman spectra were measured up to 20 GPa. The luminescence data revealed a linear blue shift of the emission maximum from about 2.5 eV at ambient pressure to 3.1 eV at 5 GPa and a strong intensity quenching. The indirect-to-direct bandgap transition at about 5 GPa, a phenomenon previously predicted only theoretically, was used to explain the strong quenching of the luminescence. This model was confirmed by fitting luminescence intensity data and analysis of the luminescence decay kinetics, which exhibited a shortening of the pulse decay time with the pressure increase. Raman spectra confirmed the stability of Cs2ZrCl6 up to 20 GPa and showed no evidence of the pressure-induced structural phase transitions. An energetic scheme of excitonic levels, which takes into account the indirect-to-direct band gasp transition, was proposed to explain the rapid luminescence quenching with increasing pressure.</description>

      <title>Development of a novel Light and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence (LIBIL) setup for in-situ optical characterization of color centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, development of the new Laser and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence (LIBIL) experimental end-station has been presented. To systematically test the capabilities and limitations of the newly developed setup, ionoluminescence (IL) and iono-photoluminescence (IPL) measurements were performed on a type IIa optical grade and a type Ib nitrogen rich diamond. By comparing and analyzing the obtained spectra, it was shown that the speed of luminescence quenching has a non-trivial dependence on the ion beam current. Additionally, it was demonstrated that some spectral features characteristic of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy color center (i.e. NV$^-$ zero-phonon line) have been observed only during IPL measurements. This demonstrates that the unification of two separate steps, ion implantation and optical characterization, could yield new insights into dynamics of color center formation.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Proliferation of Relativistic Domain Walls for Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnets have been proposed as key components for faster conventional information processing, thanks to their enhanced stability and ultrafast propagation. However, how non-conventional computing methods like reservoir computing might take advantage of these properties remains an open question. In this work, we show how complex domain wall patterns can form through the proliferation of multiple domain walls from the energy stored in a single seed domain wall driven to move at a high speed close to the relativistic limit. We demonstrate that the resulting magnetic texture, consisting of up to hundreds of domain walls with an overall conserved topological charge as the initial seed domain wall, can possess chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics depending on the strength of staggered spin-orbit field induced via applied current. These findings allow us to design a multiple-domain-wall reservoir with high short-term memory and nonlinearity with respect to spin-orbit field inputs, that is suitable for ultrafast, energy-efficient, non-conventional reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</description>

      <title>Chemical Compositions of Soot Samples in Gold Electrode Capacitors: Molecular Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP &gt; PC &gt; PET &gt; PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</description>

      <title>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Microscopic correlation between magnetostriction and magnetic damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the relationship between magnetostriction and magnetic damping is often described phenomenologically, their intrinsic connection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the magnitude of magnetic damping depends on the sign of magnetostriction in ($\mathrm{Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{4}N}$ and $\mathrm{Ni_{1-y}Co_{y}}$ alloys across various compositions, consistent with experimental observations. This behavior is attributed to strain-induced changes in exchange splitting, which shift the minority spin density of states near the Fermi level, thereby affecting both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. Additionally, the presence of locally degenerate orbitals plays a crucial role in determining magnetostriction. These findings suggest that magnetization dynamics and magnetostriction can be intrinsically controlled, facilitating the design of magnetic materials for applications such as flexible spintronics.</description>

      <title>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverted HTL-free Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$-based perovskite solar cell: a SCAPS-1D study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy has accelerated research into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. Despite their remarkable efficiencies, the commercialization of PSCs is hindered by lead toxicity and material instability. In this study, we explore a lead-free Samarium-based double perovskite oxide Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (SNMO), as the active absorber layer in an innovative inverted HTL-free PSC architecture. Using SCAPS-1D simulations, we optimized the device configuration to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.93% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.8 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.46 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.14%. We demonstrate that increasing the SNMO absorber thickness enhances light harvesting in the red spectrum region (~620 nm), shifting the external quantum efficiency (EQE) peak from 380 nm at 50 nm thickness to about 620 nm at 1 um. We also investigated various electron transport layers (ETLs) and found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) exhibited superior PV performances, boosting the PCE to ~12.6% due to its excellent conductivity and optimal energy band alignment with SNMO. These findings establish SNMO as a promising absorber material for environmentally friendly PSCs, paving the way for cheaper, simpler, scalable, and sustainable photovoltaic solutions. This work highlights the potential of HTL-free architectures in reducing costs and complexities while maintaining competitive efficiencies, offering a significant step forward in advancing lead-free solar technologies.</description>

      <title>Origin of Pressure-Induced Structural Instability in CsPbX$_3$ Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under external stimuli, lead halide perovskites exhibit large atomic fluctuations, impacting optical and electron transport properties that affect device performance in operational settings. However, a thorough understanding of the atomic basis for the underlying structural instability is still absent. Focusing on the model material CsPbBr$_3$, the inherent lattice softness of halide perovskites is elucidated at the atomic level through in-situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure complemented by atomic level simulations. We identify and explore the nature of the first-order phase transition to a distorted P21/c phase at 1.3 GPa, induced by the sudden Cs-Br bonds breaking. Unlike classical transition metal oxide perovskites, where the internal energy term dominates, we show explicitly that pressure primarily influences the Gibbs free energy for halide perovskites through the pressure-volume term. As such, strategically mitigating bond strains from volume shrinkage is the key to suppressing the first-order behavior for maintaining the coordinates of PbX$_6$ polyhedral upon external perturbation. Our thermodynamic calculation reveals the demand for high entropy in the -T*del-S term, which can be achieved by exploring a broader spectrum of doped A site and B sites in ABX$_3$ systems, enabling continuous structural changes that facilitate recovery from mechanical damage in practical applications.</description>

      <title>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temperature-dependent spin-polarized electron transport in iron via spin-wave Doppler shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</description>

      <title>Chemical leaching of Al-Cu-Co decagonal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present investigation, the chemical leaching of the poly-grain Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloy have been studied. The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH solution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural and microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been carried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively removes the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure containing nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed. Al65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy, however the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO were smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis mapping suggests homogeneous distribution of Cu and Co found on the leached surface and the presence of oxygen was also detected.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer etching of SiO2 using sequential SF6 gas and Ar plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the relentless pursuit of advancing semiconductor technologies, the demand for atomic layer processes has given rise to innovative processes, which have already played a significant role in the continued miniaturization features. Among these, atomic layer etching (ALE) is gaining increasing attention, offering precise control over material removal at the atomic level. Despite some thermal ALE achieved sub-nm etching controllability, the currently practical ALE processes that involve plasmas steps often suffer from high etch rates due to the scarcity of highly synergistic ALE half-reactions. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ALE process of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon wafer using sequential pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas exposure and argon (Ar) plasma etching near room temperature, achieving a stable and consistent etching rate of approximately 1.4 {\AA}/cycle. In this process, neither of the two half-cycle reactions alone produces etching effects, and etching only occurs when the two are repeated in sequence, which means a 100% synergy. The identification of temperature and plasma power windows further substantiates the high synergy of our ALE process. Moreover, detailed morphology characterization over multiple cycles reveals a directional etching effect. This study provides a reliable, reproducible, and highly controllable ALE process for SiO2 etching, which is promising for nanofabrication processes.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque in a three-fold-symmetric bilayer and its effect on magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the N\'eel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the DFT+U approach for a detailed ab initio study of the refined structure of the low-temperature phase of magnetite [M. S. Senn et al., Nature 481, 173 (2012)]. We compare the electronic properties of this structure and several alternatives with respect to the presence of trimeron ordering and the bandgap properties. The connection of the trimeron arrangement with site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed. Calculations of the polaron hopping energy allow us to make one step forward toward understanding the complex interplay of polaronic and bandgap contributions to electronic properties of the magnetite.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Quantum Paraelectric Phase in SrTiO3 Induced by Terahertz Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</description>

      <title>One Pot Synthesis of Cubic Gauche Polymeric Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Wear and corrosion properties of Mg(OH)2 compound layer formed on magnesium alloy in superheated water vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)2 layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate. Keywords: Magnesium alloy; Mg(OH)2 layer; superheated water vapor; wear resistance.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of the structure and diffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundaries obtained by vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on molecular dynamics simulations of the atomic structure and diffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundary created by simulated vapor deposition of Al(Si) alloy onto Si(001) substrate. An array of parallel misfit dislocations of both full and partial types is observed at the interface. Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Phase Retrieval and Characterization of Magnetic Nanostructures via Lorentz (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.</description>

      <title>First-principles Spin and Optical Properties of Vacancy Clusters in Lithium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</description>

      <title>Co-diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen for dense oxyhydride synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxyhydrides are gaining attention for their diverse functionality. However, evaluating electron, ion, and phonon transport properties and comprehending their mechanism remains challenging due to the difficulty in oxyhydride synthesis involving the trade-off between achieving density sintering and preventing hydrogen evolution. High-temperature treatments, often required to reduce intergranular resistance, typically cause hydrogen evolution before sufficient sintering. Instead of a post-annealing process aiming for strong chemical connections between oxyhydride particles, this research demonstrates a novel synthesis technique that converts pre-sintered bulk oxides into oxyhydrides while preserving the dense state. The process employs a high-pressure diffusion control method, facilitating the co-diffusion of hydride and oxide ions.</description>

      <title>Heterostructure Engineering for Wurtzite LaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite LaN (wz-LaN) is a semiconducting nitride with favorable piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it promising for applications in electronics. We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our results provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Sr-doped nickelate perovskite thin films and Ruddlesden-Popper phases grown by magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sr-doped nickelate, Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (NSNO), perovskite thin films and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases are actively investigated because of their physical properties, such as the metal-insulator transition and superconductivity. However, achieving epitaxial growth of NSNO perovskite and RP phase films in a sputtering system is challenging compared to pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, due to the difficulty in stabilizing nickel oxidation states and minimizing structural defects. Here, we used an off-axis radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate epitaxial NSNO perovskite and RP phase thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, systematically controlling the growth temperatures. We investigated the thermal stability of the perovskite phase and the structural and electronic characteristics of the RP phase films. These findings provide valuable insights into the synthesis of nickelate RP phase films using RF magnetron sputtering, paving the way for scalable thin films fabrication technologies.</description>

      <title>Physical scaling in microstructures and avalanches of dislocation by Dislocation Dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the mesoscale, the avalanche-like plastic bursts are associated with statistical signatures, whose parameters are not always well defined. In this work, we performed large scale and realistic Dislocation Dynamics simulations of the deformation of fcc Cu in bulk systems under fixed strain rate. Our results show that the power law exponent is not impacted by the dislocation density nor the loading direction. However, dislocation density controls the scaling of the power law truncation in avalanche statistics and triggering stress at the origin of plastic events. The correlation between the activities of slip systems is highlighted. Our quantitative data can provide explanations for some experimental observations and help link the mesoscopic plasticity picture to larger-scale models.</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</description>

      <title>Downscaling of non van der Waals Semimetallic W5N6 with Resistivity Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk phase of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) has long been a subject of extensive investigation due to their utility as coating materials, electrocatalysts, and diffusion barriers, attributed to their high conductivity and refractory properties. Downscaling TMNs into two-dimensional (2D) forms would provide valuable members to the existing 2D materials repertoire, with potential enhancements across various applications. Moreover, calculations have anticipated the emergence of uncommon physical phenomena in TMNs at the 2D limit. In this study, we use the atomic substitution approach to synthesize 2D W5N6 with tunable thicknesses from tens of nanometers down to 2.9 nm. The obtained flakes exhibit high crystallinity and smooth surfaces. Electrical measurements on 15 samples show an average electrical conductivity of 161.1 S/cm, which persists while thickness decreases from 45.6 nm to 2.9 nm. The observed weak gate tuning effect suggests the semimetallic nature of the synthesized 2D W5N6. Further investigation into the conversion mechanism elucidates the crucial role of chalcogen vacancies in the precursor for initiating the reaction and strain in propagating the conversion. Our work introduces a desired semimetallic crystal to the 2D material library with mechanistic insights for future design of the synthesis.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-{\AA}ngstr\"om probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction I: Aberration correction of an electron microscope without knowing the aberration coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise alignment of the electron beam is critical for successful application of scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) to understanding materials at atomic level. Despite the success of aberration correctors, aberration correction is still a complex process. Here we approach aberration correction from the perspective of accelerator physics and show it is equivalent to minimizing the emittance growth of the beam, the span of the phase space distribution of the probe. We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore, through a combination of x-ray diffraction and elastoresistivity measurements, the effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave and associated multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.026). We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical point that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd intercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions, the line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of applied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly terminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower temperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the nematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and broadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response around the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a reduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material remains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the crystal structure. Disorder, it would appear, reinforces the emergence of a "pseudo-tetragonal" electronic response in this fundamentally orthorhombic material.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for information applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials manifesting the Kitaev model, characterized by bond-dependent interactions on a honeycomb lattice, can host exotic phenomena like quantum spin liquid states and topological magnetic excitations. However, finding such materials remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on VI3, a van der Waals ferromagnetic Mott insulator, covering a wide range of reciprocal space. Our measurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate diverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed excitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev interaction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.</description>

      <title>Z$_2$ topological orders in kagom\'e dipolar systems: Feedback from Rydberg quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagom\'{e} lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagom\'e system with a similar structure as the Balents-Fisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagom\'{e} magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered nickelates are believed to exhibit superconductivity similar
  to that found in the cuprates. However, the precise crystal
  structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has
  not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations
  to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in
  the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of
  the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of
  superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate
  phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along
  the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$
  $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all
  investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional
  doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower
  pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the
  distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these
  instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the
  unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy
  structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the
  nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in
  contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation
  of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that
  structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa,
  contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of
  the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</description>

Abstract: The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication, controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit, therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science. We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Evidence of relativistic field-derivative torque in nonlinear THz response of magnetization dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of the two-dimensional electron gas at the EuO/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Effect of arsenic doping on structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</description>

      <title>The effect of grain boundary misorientation on hydrogen flux using a phase-field based diffusion and trapping model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding hydrogen-grain boundary (GB) interactions is critical to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metals. This work presents a mesoscale fully kinetic model to investigate the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen diffusion and trapping using phase-field based representative volume elements (RVEs). The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two terms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake simulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen content due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that GBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since HAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding energy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux shows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment of GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network connectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger break-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</description>

      <title>Chiral Light-Matter Interactions with Thermal Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Robotic System for Autonomous Contact-Based Spatial Mapping of Semiconductor Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</description>

      <title>Industrial-scale Prediction of Cement Clinker Phases using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</description>
