      <title>Setting the stage: Building and maintaining a habitable world and the early conditions that could favor life's beginnings on Earth and beyond</title>

Abstract: The Hadean, once thought to be uninhabitable and tumultuous, has more recently been recontextualized as a clement time in which oceans, land, and life likely appeared on Earth. This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the "impact of impacts" to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.</description>

      <title>Diversities and similarities exhibited by multi-planetary systems and their architectures: I. Orbital spacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich diversity of multi-planetary systems and their architectures is greatly contrasted by the uniformity exhibited within many of these systems. Previous studies have shown that compact Kepler systems tend to exhibit a peas-in-a-pod architecture: Planets in the same system tend to have similar sizes and masses and be regularly spaced in orbits with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. This work extends on previous research and examines a larger and more diverse sample comprising all the systems with a minimum of three confirmed planets, resulting in 282 systems and 991 planets. We investigated the system architectures, focusing on the orbital spacings between adjacent planets as well as their relationships with the planets' sizes and masses. We also quantified the similarities of the sizes, masses, and spacings of planets within each system, conducting both intra- and inter-system analyses. Our results corroborate previous research showing that planets orbiting the same star tend to be regularly spaced and that pairs of adjacent planets with radii&lt;1 R_Earth predominantly have orbital period ratios (PRs)&lt;2. In contrast to other studies, we identified a significant similarity of adjacent orbital spacings not only at PRs&lt;4 but also at 1.17&lt;PRs&lt;2662. For the systems with transiting planets, we additionally found that the reported correlation between the PRs and the sizes of adjacent planets disappears when planet pairs with R&lt;1 R_Earth are excluded. Furthermore, we examined the data for possible correlations between the intra-system dispersions of orbital spacings and those of the planetary radii and masses. Our findings indicate that these dispersions are uncorrelated for the systems in which all planet pairs have PRs&lt;6, and even for the compact systems where all PRs&lt;2. Notably, planets in the same system can be similarly spaced even if they do not have similar masses or sizes.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>

      <title>Radiatively Active Clouds and Magnetic Effects Explored in a Grid of Hot Jupiter GCMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.</description>

      <title>Imaging of the Vega Debris System using JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present images of the Vega planetary debris disk obtained at 15.5, 23, and 25.5 microns with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST. The debris system is remarkably symmetric and smooth, and centered accurately on the star. There is a broad Kuiper-belt-analog ring at 80 to 170 au that coincides with the planetesimal belt detected with ALMA at 1.34 mm. The interior of the broad belt is filled with warm debris that shines most efficiently at mid-infrared along with a shallow flux dip/gap at 60 au from the star. These qualitative characteristics argue against any Saturn-mass planets orbiting the star outside of about 10 au assuming the unseen planet would be embedded in the very broad planetesimal disk from a few to hundred au. We find that the distribution of dust detected interior to the broad outer belt is consistent with grains being dragged inward by the Poynting-Robertson effect. Tighter constraints can be derived for planets in specific locations, for example any planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt is likely to be less than 6 Earth masses. The disk surface brightness profile along with the available infrared photometry suggest a disk inner edge near 3-5 au, disconnected from the sub-au region that gives rise to the hot near-infrared excess. The gap between the hot, sub-au zone and the inner edge of the warm debris might be shepherded by a modest mass, Neptune-size planet.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for a scattered light dust halo around Vega with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies in Simple Thermal Model Results for Near-Earth Asteroids between Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX and NEOWISE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is key for many aspects of planetary science, particularly planetary defense. Our current knowledge of NEA sizes and regolith properties is heavily dependent on simple thermal models. These models are often used to analyze data from missions such as NEOWISE because they are well suited to deal with large volumes of data. However, simple model results based on NEOWISE data may be inconsistent with results based on other types of observation in some cases. In this work, we seek to better understand these potential inconsistencies, as well as the situations for which they are most prevalent. We do this by comparing simple model results based on Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX data to similar results based on NEOWISE data. This is carried out for six NEAs that represent a range of spectral types, shapes, and rotation states. We find that models based on SpeX and NEOWISE data for these six objects are inconsistent in some cases, even though the SpeX results are consistent with other methods and observations. We find that objects observed at fainter magnitudes and objects with more primitive compositions are more likely to produce inconsistent fits. These results highlight the importance of better understanding the limitations of simple models as applied to large survey data sets like NEOWISE. This is particularly true as we move into an era where our understanding of the NEA population will be dominated by future large surveys such as NEO Surveyor.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Photometry and Habitable Zones of Over 2700 Planet-Hosting Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing discovery of exoplanets has sparked significant interest in finding suitable worlds that could potentially support life. Stellar ultraviolet (UV; 100-3000 \AA) radiation may play a crucial role in determining the habitability of their planets. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of the UV photometry of over 2700 host stars with confirmed planets, using observational data from the GALEX and Swift UVOT missions. We performed aperture photometry on single-exposure images, and provided photometric catalogs that can be used to explore a wide range of scientific questions, such as stellar UV activity and planet habitability. By calculating the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UV habitable zone (UHZ), we found that fewer than 100 exoplanets fall within both of these zones, with the majority being gas giants. We also examined stellar activity based on their far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) emissions. We found the FUV$-$NUV color more effectively represents stellar activity compared to the $R^{\prime}_{\rm FUV}$ and $R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV}$ indices. The Sun's low FUV emission and moderate NUV emission highlight its uniqueness among (solar-like) stars.</description>

      <title>Database of Candidate Targets for the LIFE Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the database of potential targets for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE), a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer mission proposed for the Voyage 2050 science program of the European Space Agency (ESA). The database features stars, their planets and disks, main astrophysical parameters, and ancillary observations. It allows users to create target lists based on various criteria to predict, for instance, exoplanet detection yields for the LIFE mission. As such, it enables mission design trade-offs, provides context for the analysis of data obtained by LIFE, and flags critical missing data. Work on the database is in progress, but given its relevance to LIFE and other space missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we present its main features here. A preliminary version of the LIFE database is publicly available on the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO).</description>

      <title>Using Lyman-$\alpha$ transits to constrain models of atmospheric escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ transits provide an opportunity to test models of atmospheric escape directly. However, translating observations into constraints on the properties of the escaping atmosphere is challenging. The major reason for this is that the observable parts of the outflow often comes from material outside the planet's Hill sphere, where the interaction between the planetary outflow and circumstellar environment is important. As a result, 3D models are required to match observations. Whilst 3D hydrodynamic simulations are able to match observational features qualitatively, they are too computationally expensive to perform a statistical retrieval of properties of the outflow. Here, we develop a model that determines the trajectory, ionization state and 3D geometry of the outflow as a function of its properties and system parameters. We then couple this model to a ray tracing routine in order to produce synthetic transits. We demonstrate the validity of this approach, reproducing the trajectory of the outflows seen in 3D simulations. We illustrate the use of this model by performing a retrieval on the transit spectrum of GJ 436 b. Our model constrains the sound speed of the outflow $\gtrsim 10 \text{ km s}^{-1}$, indicating that we can rule out core-powered mass loss as the mechanism driving the outflow for this planet. The bound on planetary outflow velocity and mass loss rates are consistent with a photoevaporative wind.</description>

      <title>Significant mutual inclinations between the stellar spin and the orbits of both planets in the HAT-P-11 system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet-star obliquity and planet-planet ]mutual inclination encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both of their values are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a $\approx$5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a $\approx$10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of the HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and S-index corrected RV data. By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with $2.68\pm0.41\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ at a semimajor axis of $4.10\pm0.06\,$AU, and planet b's mass of $\mathrm{M_b\sin{i_b}}=0.074\pm0.004\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and mutual inclination between planet b and planet c.</description>

      <title>Phase equilibria of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>TriPoD: Tri-Population size distributions for Dust evolution. Coagulation in vertically integrated hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Dust coagulation and fragmentation impact the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks and set the initial conditions for planet formation. Dust grains dominate the opacities, they determine the cooling times of the gas, they influence the ionization state of the gas, and the grain surface area is an important parameter for the chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, dust evolution should not be ignored in numerical studies of protoplanetary disks. Available dust coagulation models are, however, too computationally expensive to be implemented in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations. This limits detailed numerical studies of protoplanetary disks, including these effects, mostly to one-dimensional models. Aims. We aim to develop a simple - yet accurate - dust coagulation model that can be implemented in hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks. Our model shall not significantly increase the computational cost of simulations and provide information about the local grain size distribution. Methods. The local dust size distributions are assumed to be truncated power laws. Such distributions can be characterized by two dust fluids (large and small grains) and a maximum particle size, truncating the power law. We compare our model to state-of-the-art dust coagulation simulations and calibrate it to achieve a good fit with these sophisticated numerical methods. Results. Running various parameter studies, we achieved a good fit between our simplified three-parameter model and DustPy, a state-of-the-art dust coagulation software. Conclusions. We present TriPoD, a sub-grid dust coagulation model for the PLUTO code. With TriPoD, we can perform two-dimensional, vertically integrated dust coagulation simulations on top of a hydrodynamic simulation. Studying the dust distributions in two-dimensional vortices and planet-disk systems is thus made possible.</description>

      <title>Architecture of TOI-561 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18169</link>

Abstract: We present new observations from CHEOPS and TESS to clarify the architecture of the planetary system hosted by the old Galactic thick disk star TOI-561. Our global analysis, which also includes previously published photometric and radial velocity data, incontrovertibly proves that TOI-561 is hosting at least four transiting planets with periods of 0.44 days (TOI-561 b), 10.8 days (TOI-561 c), 25.7 days (TOI-561 d), and 77.1 days (TOI-561 e) and a fifth non-transiting candidate, TOI-561f with a period of 433 days. The precise characterisation of TOI-561's orbital architecture is interesting since old and metal-poor thick disk stars are less likely to host ultra-short period Super-Earths like TOI-561 b. The new period of planet -e is consistent with the value obtained using radial velocity alone and is now known to be $77.14399\pm0.00025$ days, thanks to the new CHEOPS and TESS transits. The new data allowed us to improve its radius ($R_p = 2.517 \pm 0.045 R_{\oplus}$ from 5$\%$ to 2$\%$ precision) and mass ($M_p = 12.4 \pm 1.4 M_{\oplus}$) estimates, implying a density of $\rho_p = 0.778 \pm 0.097 \rho_{\oplus}$. Thanks to recent TESS observations and the focused CHEOPS visit of the transit of TOI-561 e, a good candidate for exomoon searches, the planet's period is finally constrained, allowing us to predict transit times through 2030 with 20-minute accuracy. We present an updated version of the internal structure of the four transiting planets. We finally performed a detailed stability analysis, which confirmed the long-term stability of the outer planet TOI-561 f.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1505.01195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) International Observatory (TIO) will be a revolutionary leap forward in astronomical observing capabilities, enabling us to address some of the most profound questions about the universe. From unraveling the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy to exploring the origins of stars and planets, TMT will transform our understanding of the cosmos. The TIO Detailed Science Case (DSC) presents science goals that inform the top-level requirements for the observatory's design and operations, including the telescope, enclosure, instruments, and adaptive optics system.</description>
