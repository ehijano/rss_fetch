      <title>Applications and Challenges of AI and Microscopy in Life Science Research: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of human biology and its intricate systems holds immense potential for advancing human health, disease treatment, and scientific discovery. However, traditional manual methods for studying biological interactions are often constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of biological data. Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its proven ability to analyze vast datasets, offers a transformative approach to addressing these challenges. This paper explores the intersection of AI and microscopy in life sciences, emphasizing their potential applications and associated challenges. We provide a detailed review of how various biological systems can benefit from AI, highlighting the types of data and labeling requirements unique to this domain. Particular attention is given to microscopy data, exploring the specific AI techniques required to process and interpret this information. By addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity and annotation scarcity, we outline potential solutions and emerging trends in the field. Written primarily from an AI perspective, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers working at the intersection of AI, microscopy, and biology. It summarizes current advancements, key insights, and open problems, fostering an understanding that encourages interdisciplinary collaborations. By offering a comprehensive yet concise synthesis of the field, this paper aspires to catalyze innovation, promote cross-disciplinary engagement, and accelerate the adoption of AI in life science research.</description>

      <title>On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational research is critical for ensuring transparency, reliability and reusability. Challenges with computational reproducibility have been documented in several fields, but healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models have not been thoroughly examined in this context. This study assessed the computational reproducibility of eight published healthcare DES models (Python or R), selected to represent diverse contexts, complexities, and years of publication. Repositories and articles were also assessed against guidelines and reporting standards, offering insights into their relationship with reproducibility success. Reproducing results required up to 28 hours of troubleshooting per model, with 50% fully reproduced and 50% partially reproduced (12.5% to 94.1% of reported outcomes). Key barriers included the absence of open licences, discrepancies between reported and coded parameters, and missing code to produce model outputs, run scenarios, and generate tables and figures. Addressing these issues would often require relatively little effort from authors: adding an open licence and sharing all materials used to produce the article. Actionable recommendations are proposed to enhance reproducibility practices for simulation modellers and reviewers.</description>
