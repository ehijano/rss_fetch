      <title>Completeness and Termination of Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

      <title>Feferman's completeness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feferman proved in 1962 that any arithmetical theorem is a consequence of a suitable transfinite iteration of full uniform reflection of $\mathsf{PA}$. This result is commonly known as Feferman's completeness theorem. The purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand this is an expository paper, giving two new proofs of Feferman's completeness theorem that, we hope, shed light on this mysterious and often overlooked result. On the other hand, we combine one of our proofs with results from computable structure theory due to Ash and Knight to give sharp bounds on the order types of well-orders necessary to attain the completeness for levels of the arithmetical hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Blok-Esakia Theorem in the monadic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blok-Esakia Theorem establishes that the lattice of superintuitionistic logics is isomorphic to the lattice of extensions of Grzegorczyk's logic. We prove that the Blok-Esakia isomorphism $\sigma$ does not extend to the fragments of the corresponding predicate logics of already one fixed variable. In other words, we prove that $\sigma$ is no longer an isomorphism from the lattice of extensions of the monadic intuitionistic logic to the lattice of extensions of the monadic Grzegorczyk logic.</description>

      <title>$O_2$ is a multiple context-free grammar: an implementation-, formalisation-friendly proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying formal languages according to the expressiveness of grammars able to generate them is a fundamental problem in computational linguistics and, therefore, in the theory of computation. Furthermore, such kind of analysis can give insight into the classification of abstract algebraic structure such as groups, for example through the correspondence given by the word problem. While many such classification problems remain open, others have been settled. Recently, it was proved that $n$-balanced languages (i.e., whose strings contain the same occurrences of letters $a_i$ and $A_i$ with $1\leq i \leq n$) can be generated by multiple context-free grammars (MCFGs), which are one of the several slight extensions of context free grammars added to the classical Chomsky hierarchy to make the mentioned classification more precise. This paper analyses the existing proofs from the computational and the proof-theoretical point of views, systematically studying whether each proof can lead to a verified (i.e., checked by a proof assistant) algorithm parsing balanced languages via MCFGs. We conclude that none of the existing proofs is realistically suitable against this practical goal, and proceed to provide a radically new, elementary, extremely short proof for the crucial case $n \leq 2$. A comparative analysis with respect to the existing proofs is finally performed to justify why the proposed proof is a substantial step towards concretely obtaining a verified parsing algorithm for $O_2$.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Cardinality Comparison Without the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work in the setting of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without assuming the Axiom of Choice. We consider sets with the Boolean operations together with the additional structure of comparing cardinality (in the Cantorian sense of injections). What principles does one need to add to the laws of Boolean algebra to reason not only about intersection, union, and complementation of sets, but also about the relative size of sets? We give a complete axiomatization.
  A particularly interesting case is when one restricts to the Dedekind-finite sets. In this case, one needs exactly the same principles as for reasoning about imprecise probability comparisons, the central principle being Generalized Finite Cancellation (which includes, as a special case, division-by-$m$). In the general case, the central principle is a restricted version of Generalized Finite Cancellation within Archimedean classes which we call Covered Generalized Finite Cancellation.</description>
