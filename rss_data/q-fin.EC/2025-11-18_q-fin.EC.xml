      <title>Consumer Choice Over Shopping Baskets: A Linear Demand Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular demand estimation approaches impose unrealistic choice constraints and misstate market boundaries, biasing price elasticity estimates and affecting our understanding of market power and pass-throughs. I introduce a novel, scalable method that conditions the outcome of consumers' choice on the structure of their consideration set: a function of all the combinations of goods - shopping baskets - considered each purchase instance by consumers. I show that if consideration sets bind consumers' consumption bundles, joint purchases induce substitutes and complements, possibly making market concentration welfare-increasing. To allow for demand estimation across product categories while addressing dimensionality concerns, I develop a Slutsky matrix proxy from joint-purchase frequencies. I test the model's predictions and jointly determine price elasticities for 20 000 goods across 500 product categories for a Portuguese grocery store sample from 2020-23. The results match observed price volatility, profit margin surveys, as well as reports on shifting consumer tastes during the sample period. Mark-ups are found to have remained volatile around a stable mean, with peaks and troughs corresponding to COVID-related events.</description>

      <title>Decision and Gender Biases in Large Language Models: A Behavioral Economic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate economic and organisational processes, from automated customer support and recruitment to investment advice and policy analysis. These systems are often assumed to embody rational decision making free from human error; yet they are trained on human language corpora that may embed cognitive and social biases. This study investigates whether advanced LLMs behave as rational agents or whether they reproduce human behavioural tendencies when faced with classic decision problems. Using two canonical experiments in behavioural economics, the ultimatum game and a gambling game, we elicit decisions from two state of the art models, Google Gemma7B and Qwen, under neutral and gender conditioned prompts. We estimate parameters of inequity aversion and loss-aversion and compare them with human benchmarks. The models display attenuated but persistent deviations from rationality, including moderate fairness concerns, mild loss aversion, and subtle gender conditioned differences.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Phosphate Fertilizer Industry Consolidation on Future Phosphorus Supply for World Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of phosphorus, in the form of mineral fertilizer, becomes necessary in most agricultural soils in order to achieve consistent high yield levels of intensive farming and maintain soil fertility. Recent consolidation of phosphate fertilizer industry has transformed fragmented trade into a single integrated global network, where a small group of large-scale companies dominates the international market for phosphate commodity fertilizers. To assess the impact of new trade structure on future region-level phosphorus supply, we simulate behavior of markets for ammonium phosphates in the FAO scenarios of global intensive farming evolution. Details of market microstructure are represented here by a many-to-many matching market. Current spatial distribution of global demand in ammonium phosphates is projected to strengthen by 2030. Bootstrap simulations produce similar network structures for both scenarios showing reduction in the density of the distributed market. In response to the non-uniform demand growth across regions, market concentration is expected to increase for small-scale markets, and to remain predominantly stable for large-scale markets; on the supply side, simulated equilibria point out large-scale multi-market suppliers concentrating on fewer markets than before. A high rate of import substitution by local suppliers in some markets indicate the need of additional region-level capital investment.</description>

      <title>A Price to Enter: Anticipatory Housing Market Sorting and Access Inequality under New York's Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how congestion pricing shapes housing market outcomes and spatial equity in New York City. Using high-frequency sales and rental data and a combination of propensity score matching difference-in-differences, geographic regression discontinuity, and event study designs, the analysis identifies distinct short-run adjustment patterns triggered by the policy announcement. Housing prices inside the toll zone fell by about 3.3% and rents by 3%, with the sharpest declines occurring immediately after the announcement. These effects weakened over time, and price resilience emerged among premium properties, indicating early market sorting and growing segmentation. The Geo-RDD results show a clear boundary penalty, with properties just inside the cordon experiencing more pronounced declines than otherwise similar properties just outside. Renters and lower-value segments were more exposed to early adjustment pressures, while implementation-stage effects were limited. The findings suggest that congestion pricing can reshape urban space not only by altering mobility incentives but also by redistributing access and opportunity. Equity-oriented design that includes early-stage support for boundary neighborhoods and renters, along with reinvestment of revenues into untolled transit access, is important for ensuring that the benefits of congestion pricing are shared rather than concentrated.</description>

      <title>Cost Transparency of Enterprise AI Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have dramatically improved performance on a wide range of tasks, driving rapid enterprise adoption. Yet, the cost of adopting these AI services is understudied. Unlike traditional software licensing in which costs are predictable before usage, commercial LLM services charge per token of input text in addition to generated output tokens. Crucially, while firms can control the input, they have limited control over output tokens, which are effectively set by generation dynamics outside of business control. This research shows that subtle shifts in linguistic style can systematically alter the number of output tokens without impacting response quality. Using an experiment with OpenAI's API, this study reveals that non-polite prompts significantly increase output tokens leading to higher enterprise costs and additional revenue for OpenAI. Politeness is merely one instance of a broader phenomenon in which linguistic structure can drive unpredictable cost variation. For enterprises integrating LLM into applications, this unpredictability complicates budgeting and undermines transparency in business-to-business contexts. By demonstrating how end-user behavior links to enterprise costs through output token counts, this work highlights the opacity of current pricing models and calls for new approaches to ensure predictable and transparent adoption of LLM services.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor: Drift Regimes Unlock Hidden Cross-Sectional Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We document a high-performing cross-sectional equity factor that achieves out-of-sample Sharpe ratios above 13 through regime-conditional signal activation. The strategy combines value and short-term reversal signals only during stock-specific drift regimes, defined as periods when individual stocks show more than 60 percent positive days in trailing 63-day windows. Under these conditions, the factor delivers annualized returns of 158.6 percent with 12.0 percent volatility and a maximum drawdown of minus 11.9 percent. Using rigorous walk-forward validation across 20 years of S&amp;P 500 data (2004 to 2024), we show performance roughly 13 times stronger than market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis, produced entirely out-of-sample with frozen parameters. The factor passes extensive robustness tests, including 1,000 randomization trials with p-values below 0.001, and maintains Sharpe ratios above 7 even under 30 percent parameter perturbations. Exposure to standard risk factors is negligible, with total R-squared values below 3 percent. We provide mechanistic evidence that drift regimes reshape market microstructure by amplifying behavioral biases, altering liquidity patterns, and creating conditions where cross-sectional price discovery becomes systematically exploitable. Conservative capacity estimates indicate deployable capital of 100 to 500 million dollars before noticeable performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an analytical account of the capacity limits and operational challenges of the main airports in the S\~ao Paulo Macrometropolis. Drawing on international examples, such as London Heathrow, it discusses how large hubs combine high traffic generation with severe physical constraints, highlighting how saturation intensifies delays, operating costs, and pressures for expansion. It analyzes capacity scarcity as a central economic problem, in which runways, aprons, boarding gates, and terminals become critical resources whose use requires administrative and market mechanisms, including slot coordination, prioritization rules, and regulatory incentives. It discusses the limitations imposed by high earthmoving costs, environmental impacts, and expropriation costs, which restrict the physical expansion of central airports such as Congonhas and increase dependence on efficiency gains. Demand projections indicate that the combined capacity of Congonhas, Guarulhos, and Viracopos is likely to be exceeded, even in conservative scenarios, reinforcing the urgency of integrated planning. The effects of regulatory restrictions on Congonhas, the challenges of expanding Guarulhos, and the structural difficulties of Viracopos are evaluated, highlighting the strategic relevance of this multi-airport system for sustaining national connectivity.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Neighborhood Design on the Sustainability of US Suburbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of suburbs in the US has led to significant sustainability challenges; yet, it remains unclear whether these challenges stem from the remoteness of suburbs from city centers or the specific designs used to develop them. This paper examines how Garden City Design (GCD) -- one of the most influential suburban design paradigms since the early 20th century -- impacts the social and environmental outcomes of neighborhoods. I first introduce a composite measure of GCD, derived from street layouts and block configurations, to quantify its nationwide adoption. I use this measure combined with mobility and emissions data to estimate the impact of GCD on neighborhood outcomes using complementary identification strategies, including ordinary least squares (OLS), matching estimators, and an instrumental variables (IV) approach that exploits historical variation in GCD adoption. Results show that GCD leads to worse sustainability outcomes, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, greater social isolation, and higher sedentary behavior. The prevalence of GCD accounts for 27-38% of the adverse effects associated with suburbanization, underscoring the crucial role that neighborhood design plays in shaping urban sustainability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10206v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a game-theoretic model to formalize Kindleberger's (1996) idea of the public good of leadership. Two superpowers use ideology to compete for influence by forming clubs whose members benefit more when their orientations are closer to the club's. Pecuniary externalities create complementarity among non-superpowers. Their collective agency forces superpower to compromise by choosing an orientation not aligned with its own. We find that superpowers compromise most when expanding their clubs but less as members become more dependent. Moreover, increased member endowments do not always enlarge the club; disproportionate growth by a few can instead contract it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17011v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I analyze proprietary data from BizReach (2014-2024) to estimate the matching function for high-skill workers on a private on-the-job search platform using Lange and Papageorgiou (2020) nonparametric approach. Comparing it to Hello Work, I find that matching efficiency on the private platform is both more volatile and higher, reflecting its growing popularity. Matching elasticity with respect to users is around 0.75 , while for vacancies, it reaches 1.0 , suggesting a more balanced elasticity than Hello Work. The study also uncovers industry-level heterogeneity, highlighting differences in matching dynamics across sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how tariffs affect industrial structure and welfare in an economy where sectors are complements and preferences are nonhomothetic -- two drivers of structural change. Import tariffs on a sector influence sectoral composition by affecting its price relative to other sectors and national income, as well as the sector's net exports. We qualitatively characterize these mechanisms and use a quantitative dynamic model to show that a counterfactual 20-percentage-point increase in U.S. manufacturing tariffs would have raised the manufacturing value-added share by one percentage point and increased welfare by 0.41 percent. If trading partners retaliated, welfare would have fallen.</description>

Abstract: We present NoLBERT, a lightweight, timestamped foundational language model for empirical research -- particularly for forecasting in economics, finance, and the social sciences. By pretraining exclusively on text from 1976 to 1995, NoLBERT avoids both lookback and lookahead biases (information leakage) that can undermine econometric inference. It exceeds domain-specific baselines on NLP benchmarks while maintaining temporal consistency. Applied to patent texts, NoLBERT enables the construction of firm-level innovation networks and shows that gains in innovation centrality predict higher long-run profit growth.</description>

      <title>The temporary impact of permanent employment incentives: Evidence from Italy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the short and medium-term effectiveness of payroll tax reductions aimed at promoting the permanent conversion of temporary contracts through social contribution exemptions. Using rich administrative data from Tuscany, providing detailed employment histories, we exploit a unique change in eligibility criteria in 2018 to estimate the causal impact of these exemptions. We find that the incentives immediately increased the probability of conversion, with no evidence of substitution against non-eligible cohorts. However, these positive effects were short-lived and appear to reflect anticipated conversions. Indeed, in the medium term, we find no persistent effects on a broad set of employment outcomes -- including whether the worker remains in the same permanent job, holds any permanent position, continues working in the same firm or sector, and how long has kept working -- and no evidence of heterogeneous effects across firm or worker characteristics.</description>

      <title>Bidding strategies for energy storage players in 100% renewable electricity market: A game-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electricity systems supplied by renewable energy sources (RES), storage operators shift energy across time, helping maintain system adequacy. However, characterizing their strategic role and identifying the conditions under which individually optimal storage operations align with social welfare is challenging. In this paper, we develop a Cournot competition model in which storage operators bid quantities to maximize profits in a 100% RES-supplied electricity market, where price-based competition is uninformative. Market clearing is embedded via a residual-demand construction that treats intermittency as an intertemporal arbitrage opportunity for storage. To this end, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that addresses key nonlinearities through i) a big-M linearization and ii) an equivalent continuous reformulation using demand blocks. The strategic game is solved via a diagonalization (iterative best-response) algorithm, and a centralized social planner benchmark is cast as a one-shot optimization for welfare comparisons. We apply the model to Denmark, using 2024 day-ahead auction data and 2030 capacity and demand projections to reflect both present and forward-looking scenarios. The results show that, in our stylized DK1 day-ahead market, storage arbitrage smooths supply-demand imbalances and increases welfare relative to the no-storage case. With limited competition, however, strategic withholding increases prices and reduces welfare, while expanding storage capacity beyond a threshold yields no significant additional gains. These results highlight storage's dual role in stabilizing markets and creating market power, suggesting potential benefits of market designs that better align storage operators' incentives with social welfare under the idealized conditions examined.</description>

      <title>Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers</title>

Abstract: We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Compensation-based risk-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the mathematical problem of allocating payouts (compensations) in an endowment contingency fund using a risk-sharing rule that satisfies full allocation. Besides the participants, an administrator manages the fund by collecting ex-ante contributions to establish the fund and distributing ex-post payouts to members. Two types of administrators are considered. An 'active' administrator both invests in the fund and receives the payout of the fund when no participant receives a payout. A 'passive' administrator performs only administrative tasks and neither invests in nor receives a payout from the fund. We analyze the actuarial fairness of both compensation-based risk-sharing schemes and provide general conditions under which fairness is achieved. The results extend earlier work by Denuit and Robert (2025) and Dhaene and Milevsky (2024), who focused on payouts based on Bernoulli distributions, by allowing for general non-negative loss distributions.</description>
