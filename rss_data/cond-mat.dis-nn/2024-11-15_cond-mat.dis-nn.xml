      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Interdependent scaling exponents in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the phenomenological renormalization group to resting-state fMRI time series of brain activity in a large population. By recursively coarse-graining the data, we compute scaling exponents for the series variance, log probability of silence, and largest covariance eigenvalue. The exponents clearly exhibit linear interdependencies, which we derive analytically in a mean-field approach. We find a significant correlation of exponent values with the gray matter volume and cognitive performance. Akin to scaling relations near critical points in thermodynamics, our findings suggest scaling interdependencies are intrinsic to brain organization and may also exist in other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of temporal reflection on wave propagation and transformation in systems governed by a pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation. These systems are spatially uniform but are subject to random temporal variations in mass, which correspond to the energy gap between the Dirac cones. By employing the invariant imbedding method on two complementary random models, we accurately compute all moments of temporal reflectance and derive their analytical expressions in short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time regime, the reflectance probability density is a constant equal to one, indicating uniform probability for any reflectance value. The group velocity of the wave decays to zero with time, signifying spatial localization induced by temporal variations. Numerical simulations of a wave pulse show that the initially narrow pulse evolves into a precisely Gaussian shape over time. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while its width shows ordinary diffusive behavior, increasing without limit. This behavior is universal, persisting regardless of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our findings suggest that insulating behavior can be induced in Dirac materials by random temporal variations of the medium parameters. We discuss the possibilities of verifying our predictions in various experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions: from landscape complexity to the deepest minimum value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form ${\cal H}({\bf x})=\frac{\mu}{2}{\bf x}^2+\sum_{l=1}^M \phi_l({\bf k}_l\cdot {\bf x}), \, \, {\bf x}\in \mathbb{R}^N,\,\, \mu&gt;0 $ where both the functions $\phi_l(z)$ and vectors ${\bf k}_l$ are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of $M$ plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature $\mu$.
  Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the limit $N\to \infty, M\to \infty$ keeping $\alpha=M/N$ finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with $N$ of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of $\mu$ and $\alpha$: replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees. We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve questions related to the mixing of Glauber dynamics in the ferromagnetic Potts model from a uniform monochromatic coloring, and sampling using data-based initializations.</description>

      <title>A Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>A survey of probabilistic generative frameworks for molecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>Charge and Entanglement Criticality in a U(1)-Symmetric Hybrid Circuit of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study critical properties of the entanglement and charge-sharpening measurement-induced phase transitions in a non-unitary quantum circuit evolving with a U(1) conserved charge. Our numerical estimation of the critical properties of the entanglement transition at finite system sizes appears distinct from the generic non-conserving case and percolation. We provide two possible interpretations of this observation: (a) these two transitions occur at different measurement rates in the thermodynamic limit, but at finite system sizes their critical fans overlap and the critical exponents we probed here show a combination of both the criticality. Nonetheless, the multifractal properties of the entanglement transition remain distinct from the generic case without any symmetry, indicating a unique universality class due to the U(1) symmetry. (b) these two transitions occur at the same measurement rate at any length scale. Within this interpretation, our estimation of all the critical exponents are sharply different than the non-conserving case, again confirming the presence of a new universality class due U(1) symmetry. We compute entanglement critical exponents and correlation functions via various ancilla measures, use a transfer matrix for multifractality, and compute correlators associated with charge sharpening to explain these findings. Through these correlators, we also find evidence consistent with the charge-sharpening transition being of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type (including the predicted ``jump'' in stiffness), which simultaneously argues for a broad critical fan for this transition. As a result, attempts to measure critical properties in this finite-size system will see anomalously large exponents predicted by our numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in heterogeneous liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biopolymer networks from the intracellular to tissue scale display high rigidity and tensile stress while having coordinations well below the normal threshold for mechanical rigidity. The elastic filaments in these networks are often severed by enzymes in a tension-inhibited manner. The effects of such pruning on the mechanics of prestressed networks have not been studied. We show that networks pruned by a tension-inhibited method remain rigid at much lower coordinations than randomly pruned ones. These findings suggest a possible reason for the repeated evolution of tension-inhibited filament-severing proteins.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>
