      <title>Workplace sustainability or financial resilience? Composite-financial resilience index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the variety of corporate risks in turmoil markets and the consequent financial distress especially in COVID-19 time, this paper investigates corporate resilience and compares different types of resilience that can be potential sources of heterogeneity in firms' implied rate of return. Specifically, the novelty is not only to quantify firms' financial resilience but also to compare it with workplace resilience which matters more in the COVID-19 era. The study prepares several pieces of evidence of the necessity and insufficiency of these two main types of resilience by comparing earnings expectations and implied discount rates of high- and low-resilience firms. Particularly, results present evidence of the possible amplification of workplace resilience by the financial status of firms in the COVID-19 era. The paper proposes a novel composite-financial resilience index as a potential measure for disaster risk that significantly and persistently reveals low-resilience characteristics of firms and resilience-heterogeneity in implied discount rates.</description>

      <title>Market Misconduct in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Analysis, Regulatory Challenges and Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technological advancement drives financial innovation, reshaping the traditional finance landscape and redefining user-market interactions. The rise of blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined evolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting opportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market misconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by addressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by discussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of novel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and taxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis and empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi, shedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we investigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for DeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need enhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the regulatory perimeter.</description>
