      <title>Extended formulations for induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give an extended space formulation for the induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs with variables associated with the edge and vertex sets. Whereas the formulation for the induced tree polytope is easily seen to have a compact size, the system we provide for the induced path polytope has an exponential number of inequalities. We show which of these inequalities define facets and exhibit a superset of the facet-defining ones that can be enumerated in polynomial time. We show that for some graphs, the latter superset contains redundant inequalities.
  As corollaries, we obtain that the problems of finding an induced tree or path maximizing a linear function over the edges and vertices are solvable in polynomial time for the class of chordal graphs .</description>

      <title>Resolvable Triple Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new construction of triple arrays by combining a symmetric 2-design with a resolution of another 2-design. This is the first general method capable of producing non-extremal triple arrays. We call the triple arrays which can be obtained in this way resolvable. We employ the construction to produce the first examples of $(21 \times 15, 63)$-triple arrays, and enumerate all resolvable $(7 \times 15, 35)$-triple arrays, of which there was previously only a single known example. An infinite subfamily of Paley triple arrays turns out to be resolvable.
  We also introduce a new intermediate object, unordered triple arrays, that are to triple arrays what symmetric 2-designs are to Youden rectangles, and propose a strengthening of Agrawal's long-standing conjecture on the existence of extremal triple arrays. For small parameters, we completely enumerate all unordered triple arrays, and use this data to corroborate the new conjecture. We construct several infinite families of resolvable unordered triple arrays, and, in particular, show that all $((q + 1) \times q^2, q(q + 1))$-triple arrays are resolvable and are in correspondence with finite affine planes of order $q$.</description>

      <title>A statistical test for network similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit and expand our prior work on graph similarity. As with our earlier work, we focus on a view of similarity which does not require node correspondence between graphs under comparison. Our work is suited to the temporal study of networks, change-point and anomaly detection and simple comparisons of static graphs. It provides a similarity metric for the study of (weakly) connected graphs. Our work proposes a metric designed to compare networks and assess the (dis)similarity between them. For example, given three different graphs with possibly different numbers of nodes, $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$, we aim to answer two questions: a) "How different is $G_1 $ from $G_2$?" and b) "Is graph $G_3$ more similar to $G_1$ or to $G_2$?". We illustrate the value of our test and its accuracy through several new experiments, using synthetic and real-world graphs.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $k \times k$ Latin square contains a partial transversal of size $k-1$. Since its appearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to several proposed generalizations. One of the most notable of these, by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, conjectures that $k$ disjoint common bases of two matroids of rank $k$ have a common independent partial transversal of size $k-1$. Although simple counterexamples show that the size $k-1$ above cannot be improved to $k$ (i.e., a transversal instead of a partial transversal), it is remarkable that no such counterexample is known for the special case of spanning arborescences. This motivated the formulation of the Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture: any graph on $n$ vertices formed by the union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using exactly one arc from each.
  We prove several partial results on this conjecture. We show that the computational problem of testing the existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify the conjecture in several special cases, and study relaxations of the problem. In particular, we establish the validity of the conjecture when the underlying undirected graph is a cycle; this also yields a new result on systems of distinct representatives for intervals on a cycle.</description>

      <title>The Rainbow Arborescence Problem on Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rainbow arborescence conjecture posits that if the arcs of a directed graph with $n$ vertices are colored by $n-1$ colors such that each color class forms a spanning arborescence, then there is a spanning arborescence that contains exactly one arc of every color. We prove that the conjecture is true if the underlying undirected graph is a cycle.</description>
