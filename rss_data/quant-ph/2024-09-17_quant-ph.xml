      <title>Improving the Reliability of Quantum Circuits by Evolving Heterogeneous Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can perform certain operations exponentially faster than classical computers, but designing quantum circuits is challenging. To that end, researchers used evolutionary algorithms to produce probabilistic quantum circuits that give the correct output more often than not for any input. They can be executed multiple times, with the outputs combined using a classical method (such as voting) to produce the final output, effectively creating a homogeneous ensemble of circuits (i.e., all identical). Inspired by n-version programming and ensemble learning, we developed a tool that uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate heterogeneous ensembles of circuits (i.e., all different), named QuEEn. We used it to evolve ensembles to solve the Iris classification problem. When using ideal simulation, we found the performance of heterogeneous ensembles to be greater than that of homogeneous ensembles to a statistically significant degree. When using noisy simulation, we still observed a statistically significant improvement in the majority of cases. Our results indicate that evolving heterogeneous ensembles is an effective strategy for improving the reliability of quantum circuits. This is particularly relevant in the current NISQ era of quantum computing where computers do not yet have good tolerance to quantum noise.</description>

      <title>Exploring Biological Neuronal Correlations with Quantum Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>The effect of non-selective measurement on the parameter estimation within spin-spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of non-selective measurement on the estimation of system-environment parameters. Projective measurement is the popular method of initial state preparation which always prepares a pure state. However, in various physical situations of physical interest, this selective measurement becomes unrealistic. In this paper, we compare the estimation results obtained via projective measurement with the results obtained via unitary operation. We argue that in typical situations, parameters can be estimated with higher accuracy if the initial state is prepared with the unitary operator (a pulse). We consider the spin-spin model where a central two-level system (probe) interacts with the collections of two-level systems (bath). A probe interacts with a bath and attains a thermal equilibrium state, then via unitary operation, the initial state is prepared which evolves unitarily. The properties of the bath are imprinted on the reduced dynamics. Due to the initial probe-bath correlations present in the thermal equilibrium state, an additional factor arises in the dynamics which has a phenomenal role in the parameter estimation. In this paper, we study the estimation of bath temperature and probe-bath coupling strength which is quantified by the quantum Fisher information. Our results are promising as one can improve the precision of the estimates by orders of magnitude via non-selective measurement and by incorporating the effect of initial correlations.</description>

      <title>Conservation of angular momentum on a single-photon level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying conservation laws is central to every subfield of physics, as they illuminate the underlying symmetries and fundamental principles. These laws have far-reaching implications, not only enhancing our theoretical understanding but also enabling practical applications. A prime example can be found in quantum optics: The conservation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) during spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) enables the generation of a photon pair with entangled OAM. This quantum correlation is commonly attributed to the conservation of the topological charge of a strong coherent pump field driving the process. However, the topological charge of such a classical field only determines the average OAM per photon, so that the total OAM carried by the field has fluctuations as a direct consequence of its photon statistics. In this article, we report on the first realisation of SPDC pumped by a single twisted photon. Our results confirm OAM conservation at the single-photon level and directly transfer to SPDC induced by classical pump fields by averaging over their photon statistics. In addition to verifying a central property of SPDC, our results present the first implementation of cascaded down-conversion in bulk media, setting the stage for experiments on the direct generation of multi-photon high-dimensional entanglement using all degrees of freedom of light.</description>

      <title>Symmetry operations and Critical Behaviour in Classical to Quantum Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of quantum analogs starting from classical stochastic processes have been previously introduced. In this paper, we generate a large class of self contained quantum extensions by symmetry operations. We show that the relaxation processes for different quantum extensions are different and that is supported by the measure of coherence, the the probability of reaching the equilibrium, decay of the domain walls and purity. However, the coherence measure based on the L1-norm does not capture the speed of the relaxation process. We also show that the finite size scaling of coherence exists for both short and long times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work we have discussed a theoretical grounding for classical steganography using quantum Fock and coherent states in an optical channel, building on previous work by Wu et al. In that work, we discussed protocols which disguise communications to mimic the thermal state of a harmonic oscillator. In this work we will extend this to transmission of quantum information, and demonstrate the utility of steganographic entanglement sharing in practical contexts like nonclassical state teleportation, even with the presence of an active eavesdropper.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent squeezing via Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement based on silicon nitride microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant efforts have been made to enhance the performance of displacement sensors limited by quantum noise, such as gravitational wave detectors. Techniques like frequency-dependent squeezing have overcome the standard quantum limit in optomechanical force measurements, leading to substantial overall progress. These advancements, coupled with major developments in integrated photonics, have paved the way for the emergence of integrated Kerr quantum frequency combs (QFCs). A platform has been established for designing EPR entangled quantum frequency combs using on-chip silicon nitride microring resonators, enabling thorough analysis and optimization of entanglement performance, as well as effective noise reduction adjustments. This platform, incorporating the quantum dynamics of Kerr nonlinear microresonators, supports at least 12 continuous-variable quantum modes in the form of 6 simultaneous two-mode squeezed pairs (EPR entangled pairs). Additionally, by selecting the detection angle of the idler mode, a single-mode squeezed state is generated in the signal mode. Given the frequency-dependent nature of the detection angle, frequency-dependent squeezing is achieved. A comparative analysis of the results under different dispersion conditions is also conducted.</description>

      <title>Bound states and atomic interaction in giant atom waveguide QED with dispersive coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the bound states and the effective interaction between a pair of giant atoms, which couples to the coupled resonator waveguide in a nested configuration. To suppress the harmful individual and collective dissipations to the waveguide, we consider the dispersive coupling scheme, where the frequency of the giant atoms are far away from the propagating band of the waveguide. In our scheme, the atomic interaction can be induced by the overlap between the bound states in the gap. We demonstrate the relative position dependent atomic coupling and explore its application in the state transfer. We find that the transfer fidelity of a superposition state can approach $0.999$. Therefore, our scheme is useful for designing robust quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource theory of coding for error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correction codes are central for fault-tolerant information processing. Here we develop a rigorous framework to describe various coding models based on quantum resource theory of superchannels. We find, by treating codings as superchannels, a hierarchy of coding models can be established, including the entanglement assisted or unassisted settings, and their local versions. We show that these coding models can be used to classify error-correction codes and accommodate different computation and communication settings depending on the data type, side channels, and pre-/postprocessing. We believe the coding hierarchy could also inspire new coding models and error-correction methods.</description>

      <title>Heat current and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a monitor under continuous measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce heat exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state heat current as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the heat current fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electric circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Dressed atom revisited: Hamiltonian-independent treatment of the radiative cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dressed atom approach provides a tool to investigate the dynamics of an atom-laser system by fully retaining the quantum nature of the coherent mode. In its standard derivation, the internal atom-laser evolution is described within the rotating-wave approximation, which determines a doublet structure of the spectrum and the peculiar fluorescence triplet in the steady state. However, the rotating wave approximation may fail to apply to atomic systems subject to femtosecond light pulses, light-matter systems in the strong-coupling regime or sustaining permanent dipole moments. This work aims to demonstrate how the general features of the steady-state radiative cascade are affected by the interaction of the dressed atom with propagating radiation modes. Rather than focusing on a specific model, we analyze how these features depend on the parameters characterizing the dressed eigenstates in arbitrary atom-laser dynamics, given that a set of general hypotheses is satisfied. Our findings clarify the general conditions in which a description of the radiative cascade in terms of transition between dressed states is self-consistent. We provide a guideline to determine the properties of photon emission for any atom-laser interaction model, which can be particularly relevant when the model should be tailored to enhance a specific line. We apply the general results to the case in which a permanent dipole moment is a source of low-energy emission, whose frequency is of the order of the Rabi coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new perspective based on Bohmian trajectories is provided for the gravitational reduction of the wave function. The quantum motion of both a point particle and an object is investigated in the presence of quantum and gravitational forces, which are related to the probability distribution of the system in its configuration space. We discuss different regimes of motion in this context. By studying the dynamics of a particle or an object, we identify the critical quantities for the transition from the quantum world to the classical world. Furthermore, the reduction time of the wave function is defined using the dynamics of the particle or object. In this method, we aim to express related concepts in an intuitive and simple way.</description>

      <title>Improving parameters estimation in Gaussian channels using quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum channels are relevant operations in continuous variable systems. In general, given an arbitrary state, the action on it is well-known provided that the quantum channels are completely characterized. In this work, we consider the inverse problem, i.e., the estimation of channel parameters employing probes in which quantum coherence is used as a resource. Two paradigmatic bosonic Gaussian channels are treated, the thermal attenuator and the thermal amplifier. We also consider the degradation of the coherence due to a Markovian bath. The quantum Fisher information for each relevant parameter is computed and we observed that the rate of change of coherence concerning the channel parameter, rather than the amount of coherence, can produce a parameter estimation gain. Finally, we obtain a direct relation between the quantum Fisher information and the relative entropy or coherence, allowing in principle an experimental implementation based on the measurement of the covariance matrix of the probe system.</description>

      <title>Quantum continual learning on a programmable superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. In recent years, a variety of quantum algorithms promising unparalleled potential to enhance, speed up, or innovate machine learning have been proposed. Yet, quantum learning systems, similar to their classical counterparts, may likewise suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, where training a model with new tasks would result in a dramatic performance drop for the previously learned ones. This problem is widely believed to be a crucial obstacle to achieving continual learning of multiple sequential tasks. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of quantum continual learning on a fully programmable superconducting processor. In particular, we sequentially train a quantum classifier with three tasks, two about identifying real-life images and the other on classifying quantum states, and demonstrate its catastrophic forgetting through experimentally observed rapid performance drops for prior tasks. To overcome this dilemma, we exploit the elastic weight consolidation strategy and show that the quantum classifier can incrementally learn and retain knowledge across the three distinct tasks, with an average prediction accuracy exceeding 92.3%. In addition, for sequential tasks involving quantum-engineered data, we demonstrate that the quantum classifier can achieve a better continual learning performance than a commonly used classical feedforward network with a comparable number of variational parameters. Our results establish a viable strategy for empowering quantum learning systems with desirable adaptability to multiple sequential tasks, marking an important primary experimental step towards the long-term goal of achieving quantum artificial general intelligence.</description>

      <title>Simulating fluid flows with quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applications and impact of high fidelity simulation of fluid flows are far-reaching. They include settling some long-standing and fundamental questions in turbulence. However, the computational resources required for such efforts are extensive. Here, we explore the possibility of employing the recent computing paradigm of quantum computing to simulate fluid flows. The lure of this new paradigm is the potentially exponential advantage in memory and speed, in comparison with classical computing. This field has recently witnessed a considerable uptick in excitement and contributions. In this work, we give a succinct discussion of the progress made so far, with focus on fluid flows, accompanied by an enumeration of challenges that require sustained efforts for progress. Quantum computing of fluid flows has a promising future, but the inherently nonlinear nature of flows requires serious efforts on resolving various bottlenecks, and on synthesising progress on theoretical, numerical and experimental fronts. We present certain critical details that have not yet attracted adequate attention.</description>

Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) in traveling wave configuration can generate localized spatial quantum correlations between a signal and an idler beam, a useful resource for quantum imaging. This study focuses on the classical transverse dynamics of the signal and idler beams when they propagate in a generic thick OPA at a nominally small angle. It shows that the beams tend to copropagate while maintaining a fixed separation, a phenomenon that we term hitching. We provide a model for hitching, validated by a numerical simulation, and we provide an experimental demonstration using four-wave mixing (4WM) in a hot atomic vapor. It shows that the OPA gain is the primary influence on the final hitching distance. These results have implications for the generation of multi-spatial-mode squeezed light for quantum imaging applications, where the exact spatial correspondence between the quantum fluctuations of the signal and the idler is of prime importance.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Lin and Pryadko presented the quantum two-block group algebra codes, a generalization of bicycle codes obtained from Cayley graphs of non-Abelian groups. We notice that their construction is naturally suitable to obtain a quantum equivalent of the well-known classical Margulis code. In this paper, we first present an alternative description of the two-block group algebra codes using the left-right Cayley complex; then, we show how to modify the construction of Margulis to get a two-block algebra code. Finally, we construct several quantum Margulis codes and evaluate their performance with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original compass state, created by superposing four coherent states, yields anisotropic sub-Planck structures and demonstrates enhanced sensitivity to perturbations, offering advantages for quantum sensing. We propose two variants of this compass state by simultaneously applying photon addition and subtraction in different orders: one with addition first and one with subtraction first to the state. Our variants display sub-Planck structures and improved sensitivity to displacements, with photon addition and subtraction influencing these characteristics. In our cases, adding photons increases the average photon number, while photon subtraction lowers it in the first case and has no effect in the second. Furthermore, an increment in the added number of photons uniformly reduces the size of sub-Planck structures, whereas increasing the number of photons subtracted from the state causes these sub-Planck structures to expand in size; higher photon addition improves sensitivity, while photon subtraction decreases it. Remarkably, under optimal parameters, our specific variants achieve isotropic sub-Planck structures and provide isotropic enhanced sensitivity across all directions, surpassing compass states.</description>

      <title>Formalizing, Normalizing, and Splitting the Energy Network Re-Dispatch for Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is a well-established method to approximate the ground state of a quantum system. Actual AQC devices, known as quantum annealers, have certain limitations regarding the choice of target Hamiltonian. Specifically, the target system must arise from a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. As the name suggests, QUBOs represent unconstrained problems, and the problem must fit within the dimensionality limits of the hardware solver. However, various approaches exist to decompose large QUBOs and encode constraints by penalizing infeasible solutions. Choosing the right penalization and decomposition techniques is problem-specific and cumbersome due to various degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate these issues in the context of energy network re-dispatch problems. Such problems are paramount for sustainable and cost-effective energy systems and play a crucial role in the transition towards renewable energy sources. Our QUBO instances are derived from open data of the German energy network and our results are compared to baselines from an open-source energy network simulation, thereby fostering reproducibility. Our novel insights regarding the realization of inequality constraints, spatio-temporal state consistency, and problem decomposition highlight the potential of AQC for optimizing complex energy dispatch problems. This provides valuable insights for energy market stakeholders and researchers aiming to improve grid management and reduce carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>A proposal for a metaphysics of self-subsisting structures. II. Quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an extension of the metaphysics of self-subsisting structures set out in a companion paper to the realm of non-relativistic quantum physics. The discussion is centered around a Pure Shape Dynamics model representing a relational implementation of a de Broglie-Bohm $N$-body system. An interpretation of this model in terms of self-subsisting structures is proposed and assessed against the background of the debate on the metaphysics of quantum physics, with a particular emphasis on the nature of the wave function. The analysis shows that elaborating an appropriate Leibnizian/Machian metaphysics of the quantum world requires a substantial revision of the notion of world-building relation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics: coupling mechanisms and diffusive approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that any Markovian master equation defining a completely positive evolution for a quantum-classical hybrid state can always be written in terms of four basic coupling mechanisms. Each of them is characterized by a different "backaction" on each subsystem. On this basis, for each case, we find the conditions under which a diffusive limit is approached, that is, the time evolution can be approximated in terms of the first and second derivatives of the hybrid state with respect to a classical coordinate. In this limit, the restricted class of evolutions that guaranty the positivity of the hybrid state at all times (quantum Fokker-Planck master equations) emerges when the coupling mechanisms lead to infinitesimal (non-finite) changes in both the quantum and classical subsystems. A broader class of diffusive evolutions is obtained when positivity is only granted after a transient time or alternatively is granted after imposing an initial finite width on the state of the classical subsystem. A set of representative examples support these results.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective method for predicting chaotic systems by using a high-dimensional dynamic reservoir with fixed internal weights, while keeping the learning phase linear, which simplifies training and reduces computational complexity compared to fully trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) uses the exponential growth of Hilbert spaces in quantum systems, allowing for greater information processing, memory capacity, and computational power. However, the original QRC proposal requires coherent injection of inputs multiple times, complicating practical implementation. We present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that implements memory through classical post-processing of quantum measurements. This approach avoids the need for multiple coherent input injections and is evaluated on benchmark tasks, including the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series prediction. We tested our model on two physical platforms: a fully connected Ising model and a Rydberg atom array. The optimized model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, achieving a higher number of steps compared to previously reported approaches.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Impact of Quasiparticles and Two-Level Systems on the Statistics of Superconducting Qubit Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal fluctuations in the superconducting qubit lifetime, $T_1$, bring up additional challenges in building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. While the exact mechanisms remain unclear, $T_1$ fluctuations are generally attributed to the strong coupling between the qubit and a few near-resonant two-level systems (TLSs) that can exchange energy with an assemble of thermally fluctuating two-level fluctuators (TLFs) at low frequencies. Here, we report $T_1$ measurements on the qubits with different geometrical footprints and surface dielectrics as a function of the temperature. By analyzing the noise spectrum of the qubit depolarization rate, $\Gamma_1 = 1/T_1$, we can disentangle the impact of TLSs, non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs), and equilibrium (thermally excited) QPs on the variance in $\Gamma_1$. We find that $\Gamma_1$ variances in the qubit with a small footprint are more susceptible to the QP and TLS fluctuations than those in the large-footprint qubits. Furthermore, the QP-induced variances in all qubits are consistent with the theoretical framework of QP diffusion and fluctuation. We suggest these findings can offer valuable insights for future qubit design and engineering optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a toy model of ion-atom hybrid quantum system for quantum computing. We show that when two atomic qubits in two largely separated optical tweezers interact with a single trapped ion through Rydberg excitation of the atoms, there exists an ion-mediated atom-atom interaction which exceeds the direct interatomic interaction. We employ this mediated interaction to demonstrate two-qubit control phase gate operation with 97\% fidelity by addressing the individual atomic qubits with lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing some of its parameters over time is a paradigmatic way of driving an otherwise isolated many-body quantum system out of equilibrium, and a vital ingredient for building quantum computers and simulators. Here, we further develop a recently proposed nonlinear response theory which is based on typicality and random-matrix methods, and which is applicable to a wide variety of such parametrically perturbed systems in and out of equilibrium: We derive analytical approximations of the characteristic response function for the two limiting cases of fast driving and of strong and short-ranged-in-energy driving. Furthermore, we work out implications and predictions for common applications, including finite-time quenches and time-dependent forcing that breaks conservation laws of the underlying undriven system. Finally, we verify all predictions by numerical examples and discuss the theory's scope and limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that using global observables to train the matrix product state ansatz results in the vanishing of all partial derivatives, also known as barren plateaus, while using local observables avoids this. This ansatz is widely used in quantum machine learning for learning weakly entangled state approximations. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that in many cases, the objective function is an inner product of almost sparse operators, highlighting the potential for classically simulating such a learning problem with few quantum resources. All our results are experimentally validated across various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: An essential step in building a quantum computer system is combining two qubits. Previous theoretical analyses of this element have been based primarily on the short schematic matrix approaches. In the present work we extend the investigation to the combination of two qubits by implementing the Dirac picture method as a theoretical framework. We conduct simulations, using parameters of grAl qubits, to demonstrate the feasibility of driving two qubits into an even-balanced quantum state. The research highlights the effectiveness of the Dirac picture method in achieving the desired state, enabling improved control of entangled states and advanced quantum computing research. The simulation results and the theoretical calculations agree within of 0.2%, and the two examples at section IV, show a good agreement to the level of 6% error from the even balanced state</description>

      <title>Quantum walks of correlated photons in non-Hermitian photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy characterizes the correlation of multi-particles and unveils the crucial features of open quantum systems. However, the experimental realization of exploring entanglement in non-Hermitian systems remains a challenge. In parallel, quantum walks have offered the possibility of studying the underlying mechanisms of non-Hermitian physics, which includes exceptional points, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and non-Bloch phase transitions. Unfortunately, these studies have only involved and prevailingly focused on the behavior of a single particle. Here, we propose and experimentally realize quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in engineered non-Hermitian photonic lattices. We have successfully observed the unidirectional behavior of quantum walks in the bulk far from the edges induced by the skin effect. Moreover, we experimentally reveal the suppression of entanglement that is caused by the skin effect in non-Hermitian systems. Our study may facilitate a deep understanding of entanglement in open quantum many-body systems that are far from thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide well-founded semantics for a quantum programming language Qwhile-hp with heap manipulations, where allocation statements follow a dirty pattern, meaning that newly allocated qubits can nondeterministically assume arbitrary initial states. To thoroughly characterize heap manipulations in the quantum setting, we develop a quantum BI-style logic that includes interpretations for separating implication ($-\mkern-3mu*$) and separating conjunction ($*$). We then adopt this quantum BI-style logic as an assertion language to reason about heap-manipulated quantum programs and present a quantum separation logic which is sound and relatively complete. Finally, we apply our framework to verify the correctness of various practical quantum programs and to prove the correct usage of dirty ancilla qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce surface ZZZY codes, a novel family of quantum error-correcting codes designed for asymmetric channels. Derived from standard surface codes through tailored modification of generators, ZZZY codes can be decoded by the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm with a suitable pre-processing phase. The resulting decoder exploits the information provided by the modified generators without introducing additional complexity. ZZZY codes demonstrate a significant performance advantage over surface codes when increasing the channel asymmetry, while maintaining the same correction capability over depolarizing channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems arise when the system's evolution is influenced by its past interactions with the environment. Here, we present a novel metric for quantifying non-Markovianity based on local quantum Fisher information (LQFI). The proposed metric offers a distinct perspective compared to existing measures, providing a deeper understanding of information flow between the system and its environment. By comparing the LQFI-based measure to the LQU-based measure, we demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting non-Markovianity and its ability to capture the degree of non-Markovian behavior in various quantum channels. Furthermore, we show that a positive time derivative of LQFI signals the flow of information from the environment to the system, providing a clear interpretation of non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, the computational efficiency of the LQFI-based measure makes it a practical tool for characterizing non-Markovianity in diverse physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the quantum Moebius-Escher-Penrose hypergraph, drawing inspiration from paradoxical constructs such as the Moeobius strip and Penrose's `impossible objects'. The hypergraph is constructed using faithful orthogonal representations in Hilbert space, thereby embedding the graph within a quantum framework. Additionally, a quasi-classical realization is achieved through two-valued states and partition logic, leading to an embedding within Boolean algebra. This dual representation delineates the distinctions between classical and quantum embeddings, with a particular focus on contextuality, highlighted by violations of exclusivity and completeness, quantified through classical and quantum probabilities. The study also examines violations of Boole's conditions of possible experience using correlation polytopes, underscoring the inherent contextuality of the hypergraph. These results offer deeper insights into quantum contextuality and its intricate relationship with classical logic structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Scrambling, Chaos, Sensitivity, and Emergent State Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum chaos is of profound theoretical interest and carries significant implications for various applications, from condensed matter physics to quantum error correction. Recently, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to quantify quantum chaos. For a given quantum system, the OTOCs measure incompatibility between an operator evolved in the Heisenberg picture and an unevolved operator. In the first part of this thesis, we employ OTOCs to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-Komogorov-Arnold-Moser (non-KAM) system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model that displays stochastic webs in the phase space. The OTOC analysis is followed by a study of quantum Fisher information (QFI) at the resonances and a comparison with the non-resonance cases. We shall show that scaling of the QFI in time is enhanced at the resonances, making the dynamics of the non-KAM systems good candidates for quantum sensing. In the following chapter, we study the OTOCs in a bipartite system of kicked coupled tops with a special focus on the mixed phase space OTOC dynamics. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of quantum state designs as a signature of quantum chaos and the role of symmetries in this phenomenon. Recently proposed projected ensemble framework utilizes quantum chaos as a resource to construct approximate higher-order state designs. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the emergence of quantum state designs remain under-explored. We thoroughly investigate this by demonstrating the interplay between symmetries and measurements in constructing approximate state designs. Finally, we outline a few open directions relevant to the current thesis.</description>

      <title>Intracavity squeezing for Kerr QND Measurement scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 053708], the scheme of quantum non-demolition measurement of optical quanta that uses a resonantly enhanced Kerr nonlinearity in the optical microresonator, pre-squeezing of the probe beam, and its parametric amplification before the detection, was analyzed theoretically. It was shown that the main factor that limits the sensitivity of the considered scheme is the interplay of optical losses and the non-linear self-phase modulation (SPM) effect.
  Here we show that using the intracavity squeezing of the probe beam in this scheme, it is possible to cancel out the SPM effect. In this case, the sensitivity will be limited only by the available power in the pump beam and by the input/output losses in the signal beam. Our estimates show, that using the best optical microresonators currently available, the single-photon sensitivity for the intracavity photon number can be achieved. Therefore, this scheme could be of interest for optical quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Theory of optical spinpolarization of axial divacancy and nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral divacancy and the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) are two of the most prominent candidates for functioning as room-temperature quantum bits (qubits) with telecommunication-wavelength emission. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of electron-phonon coupling in the spinpolarization loop is still unrevealed. In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-Jahn--Teller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence PL lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spinpolarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of ODMR contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spinpolarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.</description>

      <title>Kernel Descent -- a Novel Optimizer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations -- which leads to the observed advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>VAE-QWGAN: Improving Quantum GANs for High Resolution Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid quantum generative model, the VAE-QWGAN, which combines the strengths of a classical Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with a hybrid Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (QWGAN). The VAE-QWGAN integrates the VAE decoder and QGAN generator into a single quantum model with shared parameters, utilizing the VAE's encoder for latent vector sampling during training. To generate new data from the trained model at inference, input latent vectors are sampled from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), learnt on the training latent vectors. This, in turn, enhances the diversity and quality of generated images. We evaluate the model's performance on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets, and demonstrate improved quality and diversity of generated images compared to existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: We explore the use of fractional control-not gates in quantum thermodynamics. The Nth-root gate allows for a paced application of two-qubit operations. We apply it in quantum thermodynamic protocols for charging a quantum battery. Circuits for three (and two) qubits are analysed by considering the generated ergotropy and other measures of performance. We also perform an optimisation of initial system parameters, e.g. initial quantum coherence of one of the qubits affects strongly the efficiency of protocols and the system's performance as a battery. Finally, we briefly discuss the feasibility for an experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>Multicopy quantum state teleportation with application to storage and retrieval of quantum programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a teleportation task for Alice and Bob in a scenario where Bob cannot perform corrections. In particular, we analyse the task of \textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of an arbitrary unknown $d$-dimensional qudit state $\vert\psi\rangle$ to teleport a single copy of $\vert\psi\rangle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled two-qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob's correction. Alice may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$ copies of $\vert\psi\rangle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success for teleporting the exact state $\vert\psi\rangle$ to Bob is $p(d,k)=\frac{k}{d(k-1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state $\vert\psi\rangle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems addressed in this work.</description>

      <title>User-Authenticated Device-Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI-QSDC) enhances quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum communication.
  In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI-QSDC protocol with user identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next, we implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust security and practical feasibility for real-world secure quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formalism that aims to describe the intricacies of quantum computation by establishing a connection with the mathematical foundations of tensor theory and multilinear maps. The focus is on providing a comprehensive representation of quantum states for multiple qubits and the quantum gates that manipulate them. The proposed formalism could contribute to a more intuitive representation of qubit states, and to a clear visualisation of the entanglement property. The main advantages of this formalism are that it preserves the fundamental structure of the Hilbert space to which quantum states belong, and also reduces the computational cost associated with classical prediction of the effect of quantum gates on multi-qubit states. A connection between the ability to generate entanglement and the quantum gate representation is also established.</description>

      <title>The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with magnetic gradient induced coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC) scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless, in this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions still have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the contribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These terms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First, there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second, anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are ground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important contribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum technology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to purposefully design interaction terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of POVM decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the impact of certain indices-dependent element-wise transformations on the null space of a matrix. We have found the conditions on this transformation that will preserve the rank and nullity of the original matrix. We have also found some transformations which give localized null vectors for the transformed matrix. Finally, some possible applications of these localized null vectors and eigenvalues are mentioned in different domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, systematic characterization of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold exceptional points (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize Abelian topology of eigenvalues for generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by these resultants. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems of both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <title>Quantum data encoding as a distinct abstraction layer in the design of quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum circuits are constituted by combinations of quantum subroutines. The computation is possible as long as the quantum data encoding is consistent throughout the circuit. Despite its fundamental importance, the formalization of quantum data encoding has never been addressed systematically so far. We formalize the concept of quantum data encoding, namely the format providing a representation of a data set through a quantum state, as a distinct abstract layer with respect to the associated data loading circuit. We survey existing encoding methods and their respective strategies for classical-to-quantum exact and approximate data loading, for the quantum-to-classical extraction of information from states, and for quantum-to-quantum encoding conversion. Next, we show how major quantum algorithms find a natural interpretation in terms of data loading. For instance, the Quantum Fourier Transform is described as a quantum encoding converter, while the Quantum Amplitude Estimation as an extraction routine. The new conceptual framework is exemplified by considering its application to quantum-based Monte Carlo simulations, thus showcasing the power of the proposed formalism for the description of complex quantum circuits. Indeed, the approach clarifies the structure of complex quantum circuits and enables their efficient design.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic thermalization by unitary time-evolution in the weakly perturbed two-dimensional Ising model --- An application of the Roos-Teufel-Tumulka-Vogel theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To demonstrate the implication of the recent important theorem by Roos, Teufel, Tumulka, and Vogel [1] in a simple but nontrivial example, we study thermalization in the two-dimensional Ising model in the low-temperature phase. We consider the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_L$ of the standard ferromagnetic Ising model with the plus boundary conditions and perturb it with a small self-adjoint operator $\lambda\hat{V}$ drawn randomly from the space of self-adjoint operators on the whole Hilbert space. Suppose that the system is initially in a classical spin configuration with a specified energy that may be very far from thermal equilibrium. It is proved that, for most choices of the random perturbation, the unitary time evolution $e^{-i(\hat{H}_L+\lambda\hat{V})t}$ brings the initial state into thermal equilibrium after a sufficiently long and typical time $t$, in the sense that the measurement result of the magnetization density at time $t$ almost certainly coincides with the spontaneous magnetization expected in the corresponding equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians is of inverse-square type. The novelty of this note is that the result is proved on general graphs and for general finite-range interactions. Therefore, the inverse-square critical gap scaling is a robust, universal property of finite-range frustration-free Hamiltonians. This places further limits on their ability to produce conformal field theories in the continuum limit. Our proof refines the divide-and-conquer strategy of Kastoryano and the second author through the refined Detectability Lemma of Gosset--Huang.</description>

      <title>Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09878v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>

Abstract: Based on the correspondence between circuit Laplacian and Schrodinger equation, recent investigations have shown that classical electric circuits can be used to simulate various topological physics and the Schrodinger's equation. Furthermore, a series of quantum-inspired information processing have been implemented by using classical electric circuit networks. In this review, we begin by analyzing the similarity between circuit Laplacian and lattice Hamiltonian, introducing topological physics based on classical circuits. Subsequently, we provide reviews of the research progress in quantum-inspired information processing based on the electric circuit, including discussions of topological quantum computing with classical circuits, quantum walk based on classical circuits, quantum combinational logics based on classical circuits, electric-circuit realization of fast quantum search, implementing unitary transforms and so on.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024)]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size.</description>

Abstract: Scattering calculations in curved spacetime are technically complicated and, in the case of a general spacetime metric, quite impossible. Even in the cases where perturbative scattering calculations can be done one has to be careful about what kind of particles are sensible to measure. Curved spacetime quantum field theories are then less conceptually clear than those in flat spacetime. In this article, we investigate an aspect of this conceptual confusion - the use of wave packets in defining the S-matrix. Wave packets are used in most standard textbook treatments to construct particle states and remove certain singularities in the definition of the S-matrix. We show that this method does not completely work in curved spacetimes first in a general way and then by way of a specific model. We also discuss related effects and suggest a method for doing curved spacetime scattering calculations. Our conclusion is that the most general method for scattering calculations in curved spacetimes requires the use of wave packets, which are typically absent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Properties of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture at the infinite-particle-number limit: A solvable model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a trapped mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates consisting of a multiple number of P species using an exactly-solvable many-body model, the $P$-species harmonic-interaction model. The solution is facilitated by utilizing a double set of Jacoby coordinates. A scheme to integrate the all-particle density matrix is derived and implemented. Of particular interest is the infinite-particle-number limit, which is obtained when the numbers of bosons are taken to infinity while keeping the interaction parameters fixed. We first prove that at the infinite-particle-number limit {\it all} the species are $100\%$ condensed. The mean-field solution of the $P$-species mixture is also obtained analytically, and is used to show that the energy per particle and densities per particle computed at the many-body level of theory boil down to their mean-field counterparts. Despite these, correlations in the mixture exist at the infinite-particle-number limit. To this end, we obtain closed-form expressions for the correlation energy and the depletion of the species at the infinite-particle-number limit. The depletion and the correlation energy per species are shown to critically depend on the number of species. Of separate interest is the entanglement between one species of bosons and the other $P-1$ species. Interestingly, there is an optimal number of species, here $P=3$, where the entanglement is maximal. Importantly, the manifestation of this interspecies entanglement in an observable is possible. It is the position-momentum uncertainty product of one species in the presence of the other $P-1$ species which is derived and demonstrated to correlate with the interspecies entanglement. All in all, we show and explain how correlations at the infinite-particle-number limit of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture depend on the interactions, and how they evolve with the number of species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: an efficient quantum Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has achieved huge success in pure ground states of quantum many-body systems, numerical explorations on mixed states remain limited, despite the fact that most real-world systems are non-isolated. Meanwhile, entanglement negativity, as a rarely computable entanglement monotone for mixed states, is significant in characterizing mixed-state entanglement, such as in systems with two disconnected regions, dissipation or at finite temperature. However, efficient numerical approaches are scarce to calculate this quantity in large-scale and high-dimensional systems, especially when we need to access how it varies with certain parameters to study critical behaviors. Within the reweight-annealing frame, we present an accessible and efficient QMC algorithm, which is able to achieve the values as well as tracking the variation of the R\'enyi version of entanglement negativity on some specified parameter path. Our algorithm makes it feasible to directly study the role that entanglement plays at the critical point and in different phases for mixed states in high dimensions numerically. In addition, this method is accessible and easy to parallelize on computers. Through this method, different intrinsic mechanisms in quantum and thermal criticalities with the same universal class have been revealed clearly through the numerical calculations on R\'enyi negativity.</description>

Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of non-relativistic fermions in $\mathbb R^d$ interacting through a pair potential. Employing methods developed by Buchholz in the framework of resolvent algebras, we identify an extension of the CAR algebra where the dynamics acts as a group of *-automorphisms, which are continuous in time in all sectors for fixed particle numbers. In addition, we identify a suitable dense subalgebra where the time evolution is also strongly continuous. Finally, we briefly discuss how this framework could be used to construct KMS states in the future.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state observables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with experimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state. Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental data is excellent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Efficient site-resolved imaging and spin-state detection in dynamic two-dimensional ion crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving the locations and discriminating the spin states of individual trapped ions with high fidelity is critical for a large class of applications in quantum computing, simulation, and sensing. We report on a method for high-fidelity state discrimination in large two-dimensional (2D) crystals with over 100 trapped ions in a single trapping region, combining a hardware detector and an artificial neural network. A high-data-rate, spatially resolving, single-photon sensitive timestamping detector performs efficient single-shot detection of 2D crystals in a Penning trap, exhibiting rotation at about $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$. We then train an artificial neural network to process the fluorescence photon data in the rest frame of the rotating crystal in order to identify ion locations with a success rate of $~90\%$, accounting for substantial illumination inhomogeneity across the crystal. Finally, employing a time-binned state detection method, we arrive at an average spin-state detection fidelity of $94(2)\%$. This technique can be used to analyze spatial and temporal correlations in arrays of hundreds of trapped-ion qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystems, as well as the subsystem Shannon mutual information, in quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and fermionic chains and the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-1/2 XXX chain. For single-particle and double-particle states, we derive various analytical formulas for free bosonic and fermionic chains in the scaling limit. These formulas are also applicable to certain magnon excited states in the XXX chain in the scaling limit. We also calculate numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information for triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in bosonic, fermionic, and XXX chains. We discover that Shannon entropy, unlike entanglement entropy, typically does not separate for quasiparticles with large momentum differences. Moreover, in the limit of large momentum difference, we obtain universal quantum bosonic and fermionic results that are generally distinct and cannot be explained by a semiclassical picture.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Speedup for Simulation-Based Optimization Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of many industrially relevant physical processes can be executed up to exponentially faster using quantum algorithms. However, this speedup can only be leveraged if the data input and output of the simulation can be implemented efficiently. While we show that recent advancements for optimal state preparation can effectively solve the problem of data input at a moderate cost of ancillary qubits in many cases, the output problem can provably not be solved efficiently in general. By acknowledging that many simulation problems arise only as a subproblem of a larger optimization problem in many practical applications however, we identify and define a class of practically relevant problems that does not suffer from the output problem: Quantum Simulation-based Optimization (QuSO). QuSO represents optimization problems whose objective function and/or constraints depend on summary statistic information on the result of a simulation, i.e., information that can be efficiently extracted from a quantum state vector. In this article, we focus on the LinQuSO subclass of QuSO, which is characterized by the linearity of the simulation problem, i.e., the simulation problem can be formulated as a system of linear equations. By cleverly combining the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we prove that a large subgroup of LinQuSO problems can be solved with up to exponential quantum speedups with regards to their simulation component. Finally, we present two practically relevant use cases that fall within this subgroup of QuSO problems.</description>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is an important imaging technique used in medical analysis of the internal structure of the human body. Previously, image segmentation methods were required after acquiring reconstructed CT images to obtain segmented CT images which made it susceptible to errors from both reconstruction and segmentation algorithms. However, this paper introduces a new approach using an advanced quantum optimization algorithm called quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). This algorithm enables acquisition of segmented CT images from X-ray projection data with minimized discrepancies between experimentally obtained sinograms and quantized sinograms derived from quantized segmented CT images using the Radon transform. This study utilized D-Wave's hybrid solver system for verification on real-world X-ray data.</description>

Abstract: Logic gates can be written in terms of complex differential operators, where the inputs and outputs are holomorphic functions with several variables. Using the polar representation of complex numbers, we arrive at an immediate connection between the oscillatory behavior of the system and logic gates.

      <title>Liouvillian Dynamics of the Open Schwinger Model: String Breaking and Kinetic Dissipation in a Thermal Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion. Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler, lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP) quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate of the associated Trotter errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers can revolutionize science and technology, but their realization remains challenging across all platforms. A promising route to scalability is photonic measurement-based quantum computation, where single-qubit measurements on large cluster states, together with feedforward, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, generating large cluster states at high rates is notoriously difficult, as detection probabilities drop exponentially with the number of photons comprising the state. We tackle this challenge by encoding multiple qubits on each photon through high-dimensional spatial encoding, generating cluster states with over nine qubits at a rate of 100Hz. Additionally, we demonstrate that high-dimensional encoding substantially reduces the computation duration by enabling instantaneous feedforward between qubits encoded in the same photon. Our findings pave the way for resource-efficient measurement-based quantum computation using high-dimensional entanglement.</description>

      <title>Improving Qubit Routing by Using Entanglement Mediated Remote Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-term quantum computers often have connectivity constraints, i.e. restrictions, on which pairs of qubits in the device can interact. Optimally mapping a quantum circuit to a hardware topology under these constraints is a difficult task. While numerous approaches have been proposed to optimize qubit routing, the resulting gate count and depth overheads of the compiled circuits remain high due to the short-range coupling of qubits in many near-term devices. Resource states, such as Bell or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs, can be used to mediate operations that facilitate long-range interactions between qubits. In this work, we studied some of the practical trade-offs involved in using resource states for qubit routing. We developed a method that leverages an existing state-of-the-art compiler to optimize the routing of circuits with both standard gates and EPR mediated remote controlled-NOT gates. This was then used to compile different benchmark circuits for a square grid topology, where a fraction of the qubits are used to store EPR pairs. We demonstrate that EPR-mediated operations can substantially reduce the total number of gates and depths of compiled circuits when used with an appropriate optimizing compiler that accounts for practical overheads. Our results highlight the relevance of developing efficient compilation tools that can integrate EPR-mediated operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization problems are the core challenge in many fields of science and engineering, yet general and effective methods are scarce for searching optimal solutions. Quantum computing has been envisioned to help solve such problems, for example, the quantum annealing (QA) method based on adiabatic evolution has been extensively explored and successfully implemented on quantum simulators such as D-wave's annealers and some Rydberg arrays. In this work, we investigate topological sector optimization (TSO) problem, which attracts particular interests in the quantum many-body physics community. We reveal that the topology induced by frustration in the spin model is an intrinsic obstruction for QA and other traditional methods to approach the ground state. We demonstrate that the optimization difficulties of TSO problem are not restricted to the gaplessness, but are also due to the topological nature which are often ignored for the analysis of optimization problems before. To solve TSO problems, we utilize quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) with a possible realization on quantum computers, which exploits the property of quantum superposition to explore the full Hilbert space and can thus address optimization problems of topological nature. We report the performance of different quantum optimization algorithms on TSO problems and demonstrate that their capability to address optimization problems are distinct even when considering the quantum computational resources required for practical QITE implementations.</description>

Abstract: Networks of Rydberg atoms provide a powerful basis for quantum simulators and quantum technologies. Inspired by matter-wave atomtronics, here we engineer switches, diodes and universal logic gates. Our schemes control the Rydberg excitation dynamics via the anti-blockade or facilitation mechanism, allowing for much faster devices compared to cold atom systems. Our approach is robust to noise and can be applied to individually trapped atoms and extensive three-dimensional gases. In analogy to electronics, Rydberg atomtronic devices promise to enhance quantum information processors and quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dense coding (DC) protocol, which has no security feature, deals with the transmission of classical information encoded in a quantum state by using shared entanglement between a single sender and a single receiver. Its appropriate variant has been established as a quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme for shared two-qubit maximally entangled states, with the security proof utilizing the uncertainty relation of complementary observables and the Shor-Preskill entanglement purification scheme. We present the DC-based QKD protocol for higher dimensional systems and report the lower bounds on secret key rate, when the shared state is a two-qudit maximally entangled state, and mixtures of maximally entangled states with different ranks. The analysis also includes the impact of noisy channels on the secure key rates, before and after encoding. In both the noiseless and the noisy scenarios, we demonstrate that the key rate as well as the robustness of the protocol against noise increases with the dimension. Further, we prove that the set of useless states in the DC-based QKD protocol is convex and compact.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum Mpemba effect: exceptional points and oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of exceptional points and complex eigenvalues on the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we study a two-level driven dissipative system subjected to an oscillatory electric field and dissipative coupling with the environment. We find that both exceptional points and complex eigenvalues can lead to $multiple$ quantum Mpemba effect. It occurs in an observable when time evolved copies corresponding to two different initial conditions, one initially having higher observable value compared to the other and both relaxing towards the same steady state, intersect each other more than once during their relaxation process. Each of the intersections denotes a quantum Mpemba effect and marks the reversal of identities between the two copies i.e. the copy with higher observable value before the intersection becomes the lower valued copy (and vice versa) after the intersection. Such multiple intersections originate from additional algebraic time dependence at the exceptional points and due to oscillatory relaxation in the case of complex eigenvalues. We provide analytical results for quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix in presence of coherence. Depending on the control parameters (drive and dissipation), observables such as energy, von Neumann entropy, temperature etc. exhibit either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect. However, the distance from steady state measured in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence shows only single quantum Mpemba effect although the corresponding speed gives rise to either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly-anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Here, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include dissipative interactions arising from interaction with a common bath. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly-anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with non-trivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of quantum Fisher information, quantum coherence, and non-Markovianity of a V-type three-level atom embedded in free space or a photonic band gap crystal have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that the photonic band gap crystal, as a structured environment, significantly influences the preservation and enhancement of these quantum features. Additionally, we observe that by manipulating the initial relative phase values encoded in the atomic state and the relative positions of the upper levels within the forbidden gap, control over the dynamics of quantum features can be achieved. These findings highlight the potential benefits of utilizing photonic band gap crystals in quantum systems, offering improved preservation and manipulation of quantum information. The ability to control quantum features opens new avenues for applications in quantum information processing and related technologies.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced multiparticle bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are localized modes residing in the radiation continuum. They were first predicted for single-particle states, and became a general feature of many wave systems. In many-body quantum physics, it is still unclear what would be a close analog of BICs, and whether interparticle interaction may induce BICs. Here, we predict a novel type of multiparticle states in the interaction-modulated Bose-Hubbard model that can be associated with the BIC concept. Under periodic boundary conditions, a so-called quasi-BIC appears as a bound pair residing in a standing wave formed by the third particle. Under open boundary conditions, such a hybrid state becomes an eigenstate of the system. We demonstrate that the Thouless pumping of the quasi-BICs can be realized by modulating the onsite interactions in space and time. Surprisingly, while the center-of-mass of the quasi-BIC is shifted by a unit cell in one cycle, the bound pair moves in the opposite direction with the standing wave.</description>

      <title>Bipartite representations and many-body entanglement of pure states of $N$ indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a general bipartite-like representation of arbitrary pure states of $N$ indistinguishable particles, valid for both bosons and fermions, based on $M$- and $(N-M)$-particle states. It leads to exact $(M,N-M)$ Schmidt-like expansions of the state for any $M&lt;N$ and is directly related to the isospectral reduced $M$- and $(N-M)$-body density matrices $\rho^{(M)}$ and $\rho^{(N-M)}$. The formalism also allows for reduced yet still exact Schmidt-like decompositions associated with blocks of these densities, in systems having a fixed fraction of the particles in some single particle subspace. Monotonicity of the ensuing $M$-body entanglement under a certain set of quantum operations is also discussed. Illustrative examples in fermionic and bosonic systems with pairing correlations are provided, which show that in the presence of dominant eigenvalues in $\rho^{(M)}$, approximations based on a few terms of the pertinent Schmidt expansion can provide a reliable description of the state. The associated one- and two-body entanglement spectrum and entropies are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Empirical Risk-aware Machine Learning on Trojan-Horse Detection for Trusted Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that leverages principles of quantum mechanics to offer extremely high levels of data security during transmission. It is well acknowledged for its capacity to accomplish provable security. However, the existence of a gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation has raised concerns about the trustworthiness of QKD networks. In order to mitigate this disparity, we propose the implementation of risk-aware machine learning techniques that present risk analysis for Trojan-horse attacks over the time-variant quantum channel. The trust condition presented in this study aims to evaluate the offline assessment of safety assurance by comparing the risk levels between the recommended safety borderline. This assessment is based on the risk analysis conducted. Furthermore, the proposed trustworthy QKD scenario demonstrates its numerical findings with the assistance of a state-of-the-art point-to-point QKD device, which operates over optical quantum channels spanning distances of 1m, 1km, and 30km. Based on the results from the experimental evaluation of a 30km optical connection, it can be concluded that the QKD device provided prior information to the proposed learner during the non-existence of Eve's attack. According to the optimal classifier, the defensive gate offered by our learner possesses the capability to identify any latent Eve attacks, hence effectively mitigating the risk of potential vulnerabilities. The Eve detection probability is provably bound for our trustworthy QKD scenario.</description>

Abstract: The ZW-calculus is a graphical language capable of representing 2-dimensional quantum systems (qubit) through its diagrams, and manipulating them through its equational theory. We extend the formalism to accommodate finite dimensional Hilbert spaces beyond qubit systems. First we define a qu$d$it version of the language, where all systems have the same arbitrary finite dimension $d$, and show that the provided equational theory is both complete -- i.e. semantical equivalence is entirely captured by the equations -- and minimal -- i.e. none of the equations are consequences of the others. We then extend the graphical language further to allow for mixed-dimensional systems. We again show the completeness and minimality of the provided equational theory.</description>

Abstract: Broadband correlated photon pairs (biphotons) are valuable in quantum metrology, but current generation methods either involve complex nonlinear structures or lack sufficient bandwidth and brightness. In this work, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique for generation of a bright collinear biphoton field with a broad spectrum, achieved by using a tightly focused pump in a bulk nonlinear crystal. As the most straightforward application of the source, we employ Michelson interferometer-based quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT). Utilizing the source enables the demonstration of record resolution and dispersion cancellation for this QOCT scheme.</description>

Abstract: In quantum information theory, the accurate estimation of observables is pivotal for quantum information processing, playing a crucial role in compute and communication protocols. This work introduces a novel technique for estimating such objects, leveraging an underutilised resource in the inversion map of classical shadows that greatly refines the estimation cost of target observables without incurring any additional overhead. A generalised framework for computing and optimising additional degrees of freedom in the homogeneous space of the shadow inversion is given that may be adapted to a variety of near-term problems. In the special case of local measurement strategies we show feasible optimisation leading to an exponential separation in sample complexity versus the standard approach and in an exceptional case we give non-trivial examples of optimised post-processing for local measurements, achieving the same efficiency as the global Cliffords shadows.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a proof-of-concept establishment of quantum-secure data transfer links in field trials at two locations in Denmark: on the campus of Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby and between power grid nodes owned and operated by Energinet in Odense. Several different links, implemented physically using optical ground wires, underground fibers as well as their combinations, were investigated. Coherent `quantum' states at 1550 nm, prepared and measured using a semi-autonomous continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) prototype, were multiplexed in wavelength with `classical' 100Gbps encrypted data traffic from a pair of commercial layer-2 network encryption devices operating at around 1300 nm. Under the assumptions of real-time data processing, we estimate average secret key rates of $434.8, 148.6$, and $78.3$ kbps in the asymptotic limit for diverse channels with losses (at 1550 nm) of 4.1, 5.5, and 6.7 dB, respectively. The demonstrations permit an evaluation of the prototype's tolerance to harsh field conditions and showcase that CVQKD can serve as an additional layer to protect sensitive network traffic propagating on insecure channels.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Non-equilibrium spin Boson Model: A Benchmark of master equations and their validity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous focus on identifying whether effective descriptions of open quantum systems such as master equations, can accurately describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. One particular question is whether they provide the correct steady state in the long time limit. Transient regime is also of interest. Description of evolution by various master equations - some of them being not complete positive - is benchmarked against exact solutions (see e.g. Hartmann and Strunz, Phys. Rev. A 101, 012103). An important property of true evolution is its non-Markovian features, which are not captured by the simplest completely positive master equations.
  In this paper we consider a non-Markovian, yet completely positive evolution (known as refined weak coupling or cumulant equation) for the Spin-Boson model with an Overdamped Drude-Lorentz spectral density and arbitrary coupling. We bench-marked it against numerically exact solution, as well as against other master equations, for different coupling strengths and temperatures. We find the cumulant to be a better description in the weak coupling regime where it is supposed to be valid. For the examples considered it shows superiority at moderate and strong couplings in the low-temperature regime for all examples considered. In the high-temperature regime however its advantage vanishes. This indicates that the cumulant equation is a good candidate for simulations at weak to moderate coupling and low temperature. Our calculations are greatly facilitated due to our concise formulation of the cumulant equation by means of representation of the density matrix in the SU(N) basis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Spin Qudits Subject to Decoherence Using Amplitude-and-Frequency-Constrained Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) can be used to design the shape of electromagnetic pulses that implement operations on quantum devices. By using non-trivially shaped waveforms, gates can be made significantly faster than those built by concatenating monochromatic pulses. Recently, we applied this technique to the control of molecular spin qudits modelled with Schr\"odinger's equation and showed it can speed up operations, helping mitigate the effects of decoherence [Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064028 (2022)]. However, short gate times result in large optimal pulse amplitudes, which may not be experimentally accessible. Introducing bounds to the amplitudes then unavoidably leads to longer operation times, for which decoherence can no longer be neglected. Here, we study how to improve this procedure by applying QOCT on top of Lindblad's equation, to design control pulses accounting for decoherence already in the optimization process. In addition, we introduce a formulation that allows us to bound the maximum amplitude and frequency of the signals, which are the typical limitations of waveform generators. The pulses we obtain consistently enhance operation fidelities compared to those achieved with Schr\"odinger's equation across various target gates and durations, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of our method. The improvement is larger the shorter the spin coherence time $T_{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We give two upper bounds to the mutual information in arbitrary quantum estimation strategies. The first is based on some simple Fourier properties of the estimation apparatus. The second is derived using the first but, interestingly, depends only on the Fisher information of the parameter, so it is valid even beyond quantum estimation. We illustrate the usefulness of these bounds by characterizing the quantum phase estimation algorithm in the presence of noise. In addition, for the noiseless case, we extend the analysis beyond applying the bound and we discuss the optimal entangled and adaptive strategies, clarifying inaccuracies appearing on this topic in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Collision models describe the sequential interactions of a system with independent ancillas. Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, in this Letter we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open dynamics while they wait, which could cause them to, e.g., decohere. The system, which plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open dynamics whenever it is idle. We show that this framework greatly generalizes existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the combination of queueing dynamics with quantum collisions introduces rich dynamical phenomena, including phase transitions and a sharp dependence on the queue statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Surf-Deformer: Mitigating Dynamic Defects on Surface Code via Adaptive Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Surf-Deformer, a code deformation framework that seamlessly integrates adaptive defect mitigation functionality into the current surface code workflow. It crafts several basic deformation instructions based on fundamental gauge transformations, which can be combined to explore a larger design space than previous methods. This enables more optimized deformation processes tailored to specific defect situations, restoring the QEC capability of deformed codes more efficiently with minimal qubit resources. Additionally, we design an adaptive code layout that accommodates our defect mitigation strategy while ensuring efficient execution of logical operations. Our evaluation shows that Surf-Deformer outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the end-to-end failure rate of various quantum programs by 35x to 70x, while requiring only about 50% of the qubit resources compared to the previous method to achieve the same level of failure rate. Ablation studies show that Surf-Deformer surpasses previous defect removal methods in preserving QEC capability and facilitates surface code communication by achieving nearly optimal throughput.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Power-Law-Exponential Interaction Induced Quantum Spiral Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a kind of power-law-exponential (PLE) dipole-dipole interaction between quantum emitters in a 1D waveguide QED system. This unconventional long-range interaction is the combination of power-law growth and exponential decay couplings. Applying PLE interaction to a spin model, we uncover the rich many-body phases. Most remarkably, we find that PLE interaction can induce the ordered and critical spiral phases. These spiral phases emerge from the strong frustration generated by the power-law factor of PLE interaction, hence they are absent for other types of long-range interaction, e.g., pure exponential and power-law decay interactions. Our work is also applicable for the higher dimensional systems. It fundamentally broadens the realm of many-body physics and has the significant applications in quantum simulation of strong correlated matters.</description>

      <title>A Study on Thermal Quantum Resources and Probabilistic Teleportation in Spin-1/2 Heisenberg XYZ+DM+KSEA Model under Variable Zeeman Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of various measures of quantum coherence and quantum correlation in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XYZ model with added Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan--Shekhtman--Entin-Wohlman--Aharony (KSEA) interactions at a thermal regime described by a Gibbs density operator. We aim to understand the restricted hierarchical classification of different quantum resources, where Bell nonlocality $\subseteq$ quantum steering $\subseteq$ quantum entanglement $\subseteq$ quantum discord $\subseteq$ quantum coherence. This hierarchy highlights the increasingly stringent conditions required as we move from quantum coherence to more specific quantum phenomena. In order to enhance quantum coherence, quantum correlation, and fidelity of teleportation, our analysis encompasses the effects of independently provided sinusoidal magnetic field control as well as DM and KSEA interactions on the considered system. The results reveal that enhancing the entanglement or quantum correlation of the channel does not always guarantee successful teleportation or even an improvement in teleportation fidelity. Thus, the relationship between teleportation fidelity and the channel's underlying quantum properties is intricate. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of quantum coherence and correlation hierarchy, offering potential applications for quantum communication and information processing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations. We show how to solve these Sylvester equations without knowledge of the eigenstates of the undriven many-body system, using the driven Hubbard model as an example. In the limit of high driving frequencies, these solutions reduce to the well-known high-frequency limit of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. We anticipate this method will be useful for describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to classical optical coherence theory based on Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and Glauber's quantum optical coherence theory based on matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics, quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics provides a novel tool to study optical coherence. It has the advantage of understanding the connection between mathematical calculations and physical interpretations better. Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral is introduced and reviewed in this paper. Based on the results of transient first-order interference of two independent light beams, it is predicted that the classical model for electric field of thermal light introduced by classical optical textbooks may not be accurate. The physics of two-photon bunching of thermal light and Hong-Ou-Mandel dip of entangled photon pairs is the same, which can be interpreted by constructive and destructive two-photon interference, respectively. Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral is helpful to understand the coherence properties of light, which may eventually lead us to the answer of the question: what is a photon?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum harmonic oscillator subjected to an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach within the thermofield dynamics (TFD) framework, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and the external magnetic field. Our subsequent analysis reveals various features of this complexity. For instance, as temperature increases, the amplitude of complexity oscillations also rises, while at low temperatures, complexity stabilizes at a constant positive value. Furthermore, the magnetic field creates two distinct sectors: strong magnetic fields exhibit periodic complexity oscillations, whereas weak magnetic fields induce a beating effect. Finally, we confirm that the rate of complexity obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The methodology and computation of absolute elastic differential and integral (total) cross-sections of polyatomic molecules by twisted electron beam (Bessel Beam) impact is presented with $CO_2$ as an example. The target molecule is modeled using multicentered wavefunctions with the correlation consistent quadruple zeta basis set cc-pVQZ and optimized by the post-Hartree-Fock Coupled Cluster CCSD method. The electron density is obtained as a function of spatial coordinates and is used to calculate the elastic form factor while considering the active role of all electrons in the molecule. Coulomb direct potentials are used for the interactions of the incident beam with all electrons and nuclei in the First Born Approximation. Orientation averaging of the differential cross-section is performed to mimic experimental situations. The cross sections are calculated at intermediate energies ranging from 300eV to 1keV. The proposed methodology could be applied to any polyatomic molecule. The interactions of Bessel beams (Twisted Electron Beam) with topological charges $m_l$ = 1, 2, and 3 are analyzed. The average over-impact parameters of the differential cross-sections representing the beam's interaction with a large number of uniformly transversely distributed molecules are also studied and presented. Finally, the molecules' Integral elastic cross-section (ICS) by plane waves and twisted beams is calculated and presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We report magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of individual nuclear spins in a crystal coupled to a neighbouring paramagnetic center, detected using microwave fluorescence at millikelvin temperatures. We observe real-time quantum jumps of the nuclear spin state, a proof of their individual nature. By driving the forbidden transitions of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system, we also achieve single-spin solid-effect dynamical nuclear polarization. Relying exclusively on microwave driving and microwave photon counting, the methods reported here are in principle applicable to a large number of electron-nuclear spin systems, in a wide variety of samples.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze recent proposals by Das and D\"{u}rr (DD) to measure the arrival time distributions of quantum particles within the framework of de Broglie Bohm theory (or Bohmian mechanics). We also analyze the criticisms made by Goldstein Tumulka and Zangh\`{i} (GTZ) of these same proposals, and show that each protagonist is both right and wrong. In fine, we show that DD's predictions are indeed measurable in principle, but that they will not lead to violations of the no-signalling theorem used in Bell's theorem, in contradiction with some of Das and Maudlin's hopes.</description>

Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$.
  For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum secure non-malleable-extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03097v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct several explicit quantum secure non-malleable-extractors. All the quantum secure non-malleable-extractors we construct are based on the constructions by Chattopadhyay, Goyal and Li [2015] and Cohen [2015].
  1) We construct the first explicit quantum secure non-malleable-extractor for (source) min-entropy $k \geq \textsf{poly}\left(\log \left( \frac{n}{\epsilon} \right)\right)$ ($n$ is the length of the source and $\epsilon$ is the error parameter). Previously Aggarwal, Chung, Lin, and Vidick [2019] have shown that the inner-product based non-malleable-extractor proposed by Li [2012] is quantum secure, however it required linear (in $n$) min-entropy and seed length.
  Using the connection between non-malleable-extractors and privacy amplification (established first in the quantum setting by Cohen and Vidick [2017]), we get a $2$-round privacy amplification protocol that is secure against active quantum adversaries with communication $\textsf{poly}\left(\log \left( \frac{n}{\epsilon} \right)\right)$, exponentially improving upon the linear communication required by the protocol due to [2019].
  2) We construct an explicit quantum secure $2$-source non-malleable-extractor for min-entropy $k \geq n- n^{\Omega(1)}$, with an output of size $n^{\Omega(1)}$ and error $2^{- n^{\Omega(1)}}$.
  3) We also study their natural extensions when the tampering of the inputs is performed $t$-times. We construct explicit quantum secure $t$-non-malleable-extractors for both seeded ($t=d^{\Omega(1)}$) as well as $2$-source case ($t=n^{\Omega(1)}$).</description>

      <title>"IT FROM BIT": How does information shape the structures in the universe?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a synthesis of three main ingredients: (i) the Shannon information in nonequilibrium systems, (ii) the semiclassical energy-time quantization rule, and (iii) the quasistatic information-energy correspondence, a new general rule for the quantization of quasistatic information states supported by an environment away from equilibrium is introduced if the history of the environment is known as a function of time in terms of its thermodynamic potential for information $T(t)\Delta S(t)$ that is a free energy measuring the distance from equilibrium $\Delta S(t)$, and $T(t)$ is the mean temperature of the environment at time $t$. This all new quasistatic information-time quantization rule is applied to the expanding universe using a phenomenological thermodynamic potential for information in the matter dominated era in order to find the eigen-informations of the persistent structures that are supported by the universe (or the local environments therein) at any given epoch, thus providing an information-theoretic foundation for formation of structures and rise of complexity with time that embodies the cosmic evolution as epitomized by the late Wheeler's famous conjecture ``{\it it from bit}". This theoretical procedure must also open new avenues for further research into the quantum theory of information and complexity in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of two quantum clocks interacting with a relativistic gravitational potential. We find a time dilation effect for the clocks in agreement with the gravitational time dilation as obtained from the Schwarzschild solution in General Relativity. We perform our investigation via the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism. The gravitational redshift, as emerging from our framework, is also proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Threshold PT-Symmetric Polariton-Raman Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry in a non-Hermitian framework can be harnessed for numerous applications in optics such as laser mode selection, non-reciprocal light propagation, polaritonic optical switches, and enhanced sensing. Here we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity in the PT-symmetry broken phase via polarization selective optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A microscopic theory of stimulated Raman process in anisotropic microcavity successfully explains our results at various temperatures and enabled us to predict the parameters of a proposed quantum PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser and the proposed theory of stimulated Raman scattering in anisotropic microcavity can lead to future development of novel technologies such as efficient quantum frequency converters for applications in quantum photonics and information.</description>

      <title>Testing whether gravity acts as a quantum entity when measured</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>An entanglement asymmetry study of black hole radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's discovery that black holes can evaporate through radiation emission has posed a number of questions that with time became fundamental hallmarks for a quantum theory of gravity. The most famous one is likely the information paradox, which finds an elegant explanation in the Page argument suggesting that a black hole and its radiation can be effectively represented by a random state of qubits. Leveraging the same assumption, we ponder the extent to which a black hole may display emergent symmetries, employing the entanglement asymmetry as a modern, information-based indicator of symmetry breaking. We find that for a random state devoid of any symmetry, a $U(1)$ symmetry emerges and it is exact in the thermodynamic limit before the Page time. At the Page time, the entanglement asymmetry shows a finite jump to a large value. Our findings imply that the emitted radiation is symmetric up to the Page time and then undergoes a sharp transition. Conversely the black hole is symmetric only after the Page time.</description>

      <title>Observation of the scaling dimension of fractional quantum Hall anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional quasiparticles emerging in the fractional quantum Hall regime present the challenge of observing their exotic properties unambiguously. Although the fractional charge of quasiparticles has been demonstrated since nearly three decades, the first convincing evidence of their anyonic quantum statistics has only recently been obtained and, so far, the so-called scaling dimension that determines the quasiparticles propagation dynamics remains elusive. In particular, while the non-linearity of the tunneling quasiparticle current should reveal their scaling dimension, the measurements fail to match theory, arguably because this observable is not robust to non-universal complications. Here we expose the scaling dimension from the thermal noise to shot noise crossover, and observe an agreement with expectations. Measurements are fitted to the predicted finite temperature expression involving both the quasiparticles scaling dimension and their charge, in contrast to previous charge investigations focusing on the high bias shot noise regime. A systematic analysis, repeated on multiple constrictions and experimental conditions, consistently matches the theoretical scaling dimensions for the fractional quasiparticles emerging at filling factors 1/3, 2/5 and 2/3. This establishes a central property of fractional quantum Hall anyons, and demonstrates a powerful and complementary window into exotic quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several approaches to quantum gravity lead to nonlocal modifications of fields' dynamics. This, in turn, can give rise to nonlocal modifications of quantum mechanics at non-relativistic energies. Here, we analyze the nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator in one such scenario, where the problem can be addressed without the use of perturbation theory. We demonstrate that although deviations from standard quantum predictions occur at low occupation numbers, where they could potentially be detected or constrained by high-precision experiments, the classical limits of quantum probability densities and free energy remain unaffected up to energies comparable with the nonlocality scale. These results provide an example of nonlocal quantum dynamics compatible with classical predictions, suggesting massive quantum objects as a promising avenue for testing some phenomenological aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Realization of cold atom gyroscope in space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision gyroscopes in space are essential for fundamental physics research and navigation. Due to its potential high precision, the cold atom gyroscope is expected to be the next generation of gyroscopes in space. Here, we report the first realization of a cold atom gyroscope, which was demonstrated by the atom interferometer installed in the China Space Station (CSS) as a payload. By compensating for CSS's high dynamic rotation rate using a built-in piezoelectric mirror, spatial interference fringes in the interferometer are successfully obtained. Then, the optimized ratio of the Raman laser's angles is derived, the coefficients of the piezoelectric mirror are self-calibrated in orbit, and various systemic effects are corrected. We achieve a rotation measurement resolution of 50*10^-6 rad/s for a single shot and 17*10^-6 rad/s for an average number of 32. The measured rotation is (-1142+/-29)*10^-6 rad/s and is compatible with that recorded by the classical gyroscope of the CSS. This study paves the way for developing high-precision cold atom gyroscopes in space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is among the most actively studied topics in atomic and molecular calculations on quantum computers, yet few studies address properties other than energies or account for relativistic effects. This work presents high-precision 18-qubit relativistic VQE simulations for calculating the permanent electric dipole moments (PDMs) of BeH to RaH molecules on traditional computers, and 6- and 12-qubit PDM computations for SrH on IonQ quantum devices. To achieve high precision on current noisy intermediate scale era quantum hardware, we apply various resource reduction methods, including Reinforcement Learning and causal flow preserving ZX-Calculus routines, along with error mitigation and post-selection techniques. Our approach reduces the two-qubit gate count in our 12-qubit circuit by 99.71%, with only a 2.35% trade-off in precision for PDM when evaluated classically within a suitably chosen active space. On the current generation IonQ Forte-I hardware, the error in PDM is -1.17% relative to classical calculations and only 1.21% compared to the unoptimized circuit.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in Non-Hermitian Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03145</link>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at $K'$ ($K$) valley deformed in the presence of non-Hermiticity. This is different from single layer graphene with gain and loss, where rings of exceptional points appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone.The coincident of exceptional rings at $\Gamma_M$ point characterizes an ``exceptional magic angle", at which the system hosts flat bands with zero energy and finite lifetime. More interestingly, we find that the topological charge in the moir\'e Brillouin zone is conserved during the expansion and fusion of the exceptional ring, which is absent in two-dimensional systems constraining by Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem.These findings can be demonstrated in realistic cold atom and metamaterial systems and will stimulate further study on non-Hermitian phenomena in twistronic.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>
