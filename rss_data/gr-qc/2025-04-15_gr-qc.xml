      <title>Exploring the Effects of Generalized Entropy onto Bardeen Black Hole Surrounded by Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic characteristics and geothermodynamics of a Bardeen black hole (BH) that interacts with a string cloud and is minimally connected to nonlinear electrodynamics. To avoid the singularities throughout the cosmic evolution, we consider an entropy function which comprises five parameters. In addition, by employing this entropy function for the specific range of parameters, we obtain the representations of BH entropy based on the holographic principle. Moreover, we employ this entropy function to investigate its impact on the thermodynamics of the BH by studying various thermodynamic properties like mass, temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy for numerous scalar charge and string cloud values. To support our investigation, we use various geothermodynamics formalisms to evaluate the stable behavior and identify different physical scenarios. Furthermore, in this analysis, we observe that only one entropy formalism provides us with better results regarding the thermodynamic behavior of the BH. Moreover, it is shown that one of the entropy models provides a thermodynamic geometric behavior compared to the other entropy models.</description>

      <title>A glimpse into the magical world of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay it is proved that, in a self-consistent semiclassical theory of gravity, the asymptotically measured orbital periods of test particles around central compact objects are fundamentally bounded from below by the compact universal relation $T_{\infty}\geq{{2\pi e\hbar}\over{\sqrt{G}c^2 m^2_{e}}}$ [here $\{m_e,e\}$ are respectively the proper mass and the electric charge of the electron, the lightest charged particle]. The explicit dependence of the lower bound on the fundamental constants $\{G,c,\hbar\}$ of gravity, special relativity, and quantum theory suggests that it provides a rare glimpse into the yet unknown quantum theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Light rings, timelike circular orbits and curvature of traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of light rings (LR's) and timelike circular orbits (TCO's) in spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat wormhole geometries. We use a purely geometric approach based in the intrinsic curvatures of a $2$-dimensional Riemannian metric obtained by projecting the spacetime metric over surfaces of constant energy. Using the asymptotic and near throat limits of geodesic curvature we determine the existence of LR's and TCO's in wormhole geometries, then analyzing the sign of the Gaussian curvature we are able to determine their stability. We deduce the conditions for the existence of photon and massive particle surfaces. We apply the results to the Morris-Thorne family of wormholes and the Damour-Solodukhin wormholes. We show that for the wormholes considered there is always an odd number of light rings, one of them at the throat. In the case of Morris-Thorne wormhole our method leads to a procedure for building a wormhole with more than one LR. We study how the procedure can be extended to other wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of the Light Cone: Fock representation and Spectrum of Radiated Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the symplectic potential for the $\gamma$-Palatini--Holst action on a null hypersurface, we identify an auxiliary conformal field theory (CFT), which carries a representation of the constraint algebra of general relativity on a null surface. The radiative data, which is encoded into the shear of each null generator, is mapped into an $SU(1,1)$ current algebra on each light ray. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. In the fermionic representation, the central charge on each null ray is positive, for bosons it is negative. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In the model, there is a natural $SU(1,1)$ Casimir. For the bosonic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir can have either sign. For the fermionic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir is always greater or equal to zero. To exclude negative norm states, we restrict ourselves to the fermionic case. To understand the physical implications of this restriction, we express the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir in terms of the geometric data. In this way, the positivity bound on the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir translates into an upper bound for the shear of each null generator. In the model, this bound must be satisfied for all three-dimensional null hypersurfaces. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimal RT Coupling and its Impact on Inflationary Evolution in f(R, T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine inflationary models in the $f(R, T)$ gravity framework where we have a conformal constant and an $RT$-mixing term apart from an R term. The RT-mixing term introduces non-minimal coupling between gravity and matter. We consider the exponential SUSY potential $V(\p)=M^4 \lt(1-e^{-\l \p/\mp}\rt)$ and a novel potential $V(\p)=\l \mp^{4-2\a} \p^{2\a} \sin^2\lt(\frac{\b \mp^\a}{\p^\a}\rt)$. With the help of COBE normalization, we constrain values of different parameters and extract the field value at the time of Hubble crossing. The end of inflation is marked by $\tep(\p_i)=1$ where $\p_i$ is the field value at the end of inflation. Equipped with these values, we then move on to calculate values of spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Our predicted values of $n_s$ and $r$ fall within their observed values from the Planck 2018 survey and BICEP/Keck array measurement for both potential, making them plausible candidates for the inflationary model. We also display the variation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index with the coefficient of RT-mixing term for fixed values of e-fold number. There, we find the existence of two local maxima of $n_s$, which occur at a negative and a positive value of $\x$, the coefficient of $RT$-mixing term. Our analysis finds a significant impact of $\x$ on values of observables</description>

      <title>Gravitational Entropy of Hayward Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational entropy defined by the Weyl curvature for the Hayward black hole, which is one of the regular black holes without singularity in the event horizon. Using the definition by the ratio of the Weyl curvature scalar and the Kretschmann scalar as the entropy measure, we evaluate the gravitational entropy on the outer and inner horizons. We derive an expression for the curvature tensor of the Hayward black hole that is as independent as possible of the parameter added to the black hole and give an equation for the entropy measure explicitly independent of that parameter. The gravitational entropy density used in previous studies presents questions from the standpoint of mathematical rigor while we discuss possible improvements in its definition. We compare the results for the Hayward black hole with the analysis for the Reisner-Nordst\"{o}m black hole and discuss the effect of singularity resolution on gravitational entropy.</description>

      <title>The effects of asymptotically flat $R^2$ spacetime on black hole image of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of analytically expressible vacuum solutions has recently been discovered for pure ${R}^2$ gravity, building upon Buchdahl's seminal work from 1962. These solutions, inspired by Buchdahl's framework, offer a promising avenue for testing ${R}^2$ gravity against astrophysical observations. Within a subset of asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired vacuum spacetimes, we introduce a free parameter $\epsilon$ to characterize deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, which is recovered in the limit $\epsilon = 0$. In this study, we employ the publicly available code \textit{ipole} to simulate black hole images under the Buchdahl-inspired metric, with a focus on the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Our simulations show that both the shadow size and photon ring diameter decrease monotonically with increasing $\epsilon$. By exploring a range of observational inclination angles, we find that the photon ring diameter being a direct observable is only weakly sensitive to the inclination angle. We further constrain the parameter $\epsilon$ by comparing our simulation results with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*. The obtained bounds are consistent with those previously derived from the orbital motion of the S2 star, but provide tighter constraints. In addition, we analyze the influence of the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime on the polarization patterns near the black hole and find its impact to be minimal. In contrast, the observational inclination angle has a substantial effect on the observed polarization structure, highlighting the dominant role of viewing geometry in shaping polarization features.</description>

      <title>Analytical coordinate time at the second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the analytical expression of the coordinate time $t$ in terms of the eccentric anomaly $u$ at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The parametrization of $t$ with $u$ permits to reduce at the minimum the presence of discontinuous trigonometric functions. This is helpful as they must be properly connected via accumulation functions to finally have a smooth coordinate time $t(u)$. Another difficulty relies on the presence of an infinite sum, about which we derive a compact form. This effort reveals to be extremely useful for application purposes. Indeed, we need to truncate the aforementioned sum to a certain finite threshold, which strongly depends on the selected parameter values and the accuracy error we would like to achieve. Thanks to our work, this analysis can be easily carried out.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectral implementation of the Einstein-Maxwell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetism plays an important role in a variety of applications in gravity that we wish to investigate. To that end, in this work, we present an implementation of the Maxwell equations within the adaptive-mesh pseudospectral numerical relativity code bamps. We present a thorough analysis of the evolution equations as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs, including the construction of the characteristic variables for use in our penalty boundary communication scheme, and radiation controlling, constraint preserving outer boundary conditions which, in the language of Kreiss-Agranovich-M\'etivier, are shown to be boundary-stable. After presenting a formulation of the Maxwell constraints that we may solve for initial data, we move on to present a suite of numerical tests. Our simulations, both within the Cowling approximation, and in full non-linear evolution, demonstrate rapid convergence of error with resolution, as well as consistency with known quasinormal decay rates on the Kerr background. Finally we present evolutions of the electrovacuum equations of motion with strong data, a good representation of typical critical collapse runs.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity with DESI DR2 BAO and GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $f\left( Q \right) $-theory for the description of dark energy with a non-trivial connection defined in the non-coincident gauge. The resulting field equations form a two-scalar-field, quintom-like gravitational model. For the power-law model $f\left( Q \right) \simeq Q^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$, we construct an analytic expression for the dynamical evolution of dark energy, which depends on the parameter $n$. We constrain this dark energy model using the the baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and gamma-ray bursts. The cosmological data provides $n \simeq0.33 $. The $f\left( Q \right) $-model challenges the $\Lambda$CDM by providing a smaller value for $\chi_{\min}^{2}$, while there is weak evidence in favor of the $f\left( Q \right) $-theory.</description>

      <title>Can Quasi Periodic Oscillations Encode Traces of Black Hole Phase Transitions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding observational evidence or imprints of black hole phase transitions is a promising and active area of research. Aiming to contribute to this direction, in this work, we probe the well-known thermodynamic phase structure of the Reissner Nordstr\"om Anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole through the lens of its quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Can QPOs be influenced by black hole phase transitions? Do they carry any signature of such transitions in their observational patterns? These were the central questions guiding our study. By analyzing the upper and lower QPO frequencies within the Relativistic Precession (RP) model, we observe that the frequency-temperature relationship reflects distinguishing features corresponding to the small, intermediate, and large black hole phases, offering insights into their stability properties. The analysis is further extended to other QPO models, including the Warped Disk (WD) and Epicyclic Resonance (ER) models. The presence of distinct phase structures remains evident across all models which is an encouraging outcome that may be worth exploring further in the context of other black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from primordial gravitational collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole (PBH) is formed. In this Letter, we report a new source of the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of sound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Abundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially detectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne detectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Black Holes Thermodynamics in Non-Quasi-Static Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy satisfies the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics for arbitrary thermodynamic evolution within Einstein-Maxwell theory. In contrast, the black hole entropy that satisfies the second law in low-energy effective modified gravity theories related to quantum gravity is derived solely by considering linear perturbations within quasi-static processes. Since astrophysical processes are typically non-quasi-static, deriving a rigorous expression for entropy within the quasi-static framework is not feasible. By treating the effective quantum corrections as first-order perturbations, the black hole entropy in Einstein-Maxwell gravity with generalized quadratic corrections for arbitrary dynamical processes is derived. This entropy is distinct from the Iyer-Wald and Dong-Wald entropies and is applicable to non-quasi-static processes. Furthermore, it is shown that the black hole entropy is consistent with the generalized covariant entropy boundary. This work establishes a framework for examining the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics in non-static processes within modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves from the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) throughout the Universe. The LISA data stream will feature many superposed signals from different astrophysical sources, requiring a global fit procedure. Most of the MBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the merger; and for those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the merger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position in the sky. In this paper, we present a fast detection and signal reconstruction scheme for massive black hole binaries in the LISA observation band. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first subtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit, and (ii) an efficient early detection scheme providing a time-of-merger estimate for a pre-merger signal, that will allow to trigger a protection period, placing LISA in ``do not disturb'' mode and enabling more detailed analysis that will facilitate multi-messenger observations. We highlight the effect of confusion of several overlapping in time MBHB signals in the pre-merger detection.</description>

Abstract: We study gravitational waves in a de-Sitter background in linearized Horndeski theory. This background can be obtained in different ways in this theory. We first consider an arbitrary potential to implement an effective cosmological constant. The scalar field has long range whereas its potential can induce a mass term, rendering its range to short distances. A second effect of the potential is the possibility to induce a background curvature or an effective cosmological constant via the minimum of the potential. The latter is usually ignored in the literature to have an asymptotically flat background for the gravitational waves. In order to fill this gap, we consider the effects of the scalar potential in the framework of gravitational waves in the theories having such scalar couplings, and compare its effects with other approaches such as the presence of a vacuum energy density filling the spacetime or a linear potential which leads to an effective cosmological constant but now with a massless scalar field. We discuss properties of the gravitational waves, their propagation and interaction with the medium in which they propagate. The minimum of the scalar potential term mimics a cosmological constant and leads to separate redshifts in the effective frequency and wave number, which also discriminates the tensorial and massive scalar waves. We see that, depending on the implementation to have a cosmological constant, the propagation speeds and polarization properties of scalar modes of these waves is different, as summarized in the paper.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional rotating and Quintessence black hole and their shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new five-dimensional rotating quintessence black hole solution. To obtain this, we employ the $5D$ version of the Janis Newman algorithm, which incorporates the Hopf bifurcation. The variation of the quintessence parameter $w_q$ causes the geometry to transition from a regular rotating universe surrounded by a cosmological horizon to a singular rotating geometry, which can represent a naked singularity, a singular extremal black hole, or a singular black hole with both an inner and an outer (event) horizon. We have also determined the properties of the ergosphere. For the study of the shadow, we followed a novel approach in which the $2D$ shadow observed by humans corresponds to cross-sections of the $3D$ shadow. We analyzed how quintessence affects both the size and shape of the black hole shadow, showing that increasing the quintessence strength reduces the shadow radius, contrary to the known results in $4D$. We also propose a speculative methodology to test the shadow behavior in five-dimensional scenarios, in light of the constraints provided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) concerning the shadow of the four-dimensional supermassive black hole M87. We identify scenarios in which the theoretical $5D$ results could be consistent with these observational constraints. Finally, we determine the energy conditions required to support the solution.</description>

      <title>Cosmological model in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity with quadratic equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have explored a transitioning cosmological model of universe's expansion in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity. The quadratic type of equation of state parameter in the form $\omega=-1 + \alpha (1 + z) + \beta (1 + z)^2$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants, is considered to determine the explicit solution of field equations and derive Hubble parameter in term of redshift $z$. The model parameters are estimated taking observational datasets of BAO, Pantheon, and CC using MCMC analysis. Some dynamical properties like EOS parameter, energy density, pressure, and deceleration parameter are described. The cosmographic parameter like statefinders ($r,s$), jerk parameter ($j$) etc are also thoroughly explained. The energy conditions are also examined to validate the viability of the proposed model. We observe a transition redshift at $z_{t} = 0.942^{+0.112}_{-0.164}$ with the present value of deceleration parameter $q_0 = -0.4815^{+0.0362}_{-0.0096}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ATC) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. The role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Complex structure of time-periodic solutions decoded in Poincar\'{e}-Lindstedt series: the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Ray geodesics and wave propagation on the Beltrami surface: Optics of an optical wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates ray geodesics and wave propagation on the Beltrami surface, with a particular emphasis on the effective potentials governing photon dynamics. We derive the geodesic equations and analyze the Helmholtz equation within this curved geometry, revealing that the resulting potentials are purely repulsive. For ray trajectories, the potential is determined by wormhole parameters such as the throat radius ($\ell$), radial optical distance ($u$), scale parameter ($R$), and the angular momentum of the test field. Near the wormhole throat, the potential remains constant, preventing inward motion below a critical energy threshold, whereas at larger radial distances, it decays exponentially, allowing free propagation. In the context of wave propagation, the potential exhibits a centrifugal barrier along with a constant repulsive term at large $u$. The Beltrami surface, characterized by constant negative Gaussian curvature, serves as a model for graphene sheets and optical wormholes in condensed matter systems. These results allow us to determine the space- and frequency-dependent refractive index of the medium, providing a coherent framework for understanding photon behavior in such systems, with promising implications for material applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the entanglement dynamics of two massive particles confined within their respective infinite square potential wells induced by gravity. Assuming that each particle is initially in the ground state of its infinite square well, we investigate the formation of entanglement between the particles as a result of their gravitational interaction during their adiabatic movement towards each other. Our results reveal that, under suitable parameters, entanglement swiftly emerges. Compared to previous schemes, our approach significantly reduces the particle mass, greatly lowering the experimental threshold.</description>

      <title>Cross terms and monochromatic gravitational wave sources in our Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational capture of a small compact object by a supermassive black hole is one of the most intriguing sources of gravitational waves to be detected by space-borne observatories. Modeling gravitational waves is a challenging task. However, various approximations exist that enable us to claim detection and perform parameter extraction with high accuracy on synthetic data. The first numerical implementation of relativistic corrections for an astrophysical system was conducted in a post-Newtonian (PN) framework, and since then, most comparable programmes have followed a similar approach. Nevertheless, the PN approach has been developed for two particles in a vacuum. Here, we present the first results on the impact of cross-terms in the PN scheme for ``monochromatic'' sources (meaning that the peak frequency does not evolve over the observational time), which account for the interplay between different bodies. We present a conceptual and illustrative study of the cross-terms on the first PN term in a group of three bodies representing asymmetric binaries (X-MRIs, E-EMRIs, and X-MRIs with E-EMRIs). We find that these cross-terms can lead to a complete phase shift of the gravitational wave by a few times $2\pi$ over periods of time of less than one year for the close binaries. Ignoring the cross-terms in the relativistic semi-Keplerian system can significantly complicate parameter extraction for monochromatic sources.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magnetic Field Amplification in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a binary neutron stars merger is governed by physics under the most extreme conditions, including strong spacetime curvature, ultra-high matter densities, luminous neutrino emission and the rapid amplification of the initial neutron star magnetic fields. Here we systematically explore how sensitive the magnetic field evolution is to the total mass of the merging binary, to the mass ratio of its components, the stellar spins and to the equation of state. For this purpose, we analyze 16 state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations that employ a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved small-scale turbulence. We find that strong and rapid amplification of the magnetic field to volume-averaged values of $\sim 10^{16}$~G in the high-density regions is a very robust outcome of a neutron star merger and this result is only marginally impacted by either mass, mass ratio, spin or equation of state.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Spacetime Penrose Inequality With Suboptimal Constant in the Asymptotically Flat and Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish mass lower bounds of Penrose-type in the setting of $3$-dimensional initial data sets for the Einstein equations satisfying the dominant energy condition, which are either asymptotically flat or asymptotically hyperboloidal. More precisely, the lower bound consists of a universal constant multiplied by the square root of the minimal area required to enclose the outermost apparent horizon. Here the outermost apparent horizon may contain both marginally outer trapped (MOTS) and marginally inner trapped (MITS) components. The proof is based on the harmonic level set approach to the positive mass theorem, combined with the Jang equation and techniques arising from the stability argument of Dong-Song \cite{Dong-Song}. As a corollary, we also obtain a version of the Penrose inequality for 3-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane model, the radion potential was fine-tuned to zero, leaving the extra-dimensional modulus undetermined. Goldberger and Wise (GW) introduced a stabilization mechanism by incorporating a massive bulk scalar field, leading to a radion potential with a stable minimum. In this work, we examine the impact of the intrinsic stability of the GW scalar field on the modulus stabilization procedure. To elucidate this relationship, we test the stabilization scheme across several relevant scenarios using methods of singular perturbation theory. Our analysis consistently indicates a one-to-one correspondence between the stability of the GW scalar and successful modulus stabilization. Additionally, we highlight that certain classes of GW bulk potentials elevate the possibility of such a correspondence, and provide checks which any GW bulk potential must satisfy in order to ensure modulus stabilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On real metric manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation, sectorial operators are introduced that interpolate between the generalized Laplacian and the d'Alembertian. This is used to construct a one-parameter family of analytic semigroups that remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. In the strict Lorentzian limit we identify a sense in which a well-defined Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group arises. For the analytic semigroups we show in addition that: (i) they act as integral operators with kernels that are jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (ii) the diagonal of the kernels admits an asymptotic expansion in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of three-dimensional BTZ black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a universal thermodynamic topological classification for three-dimensional static neutral Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ), charged BTZ, and rotating BTZ black holes. We demonstrate that in all three cases (static neutral BTZ, charged BTZ, and rotating BTZ black holes), both the innermost small black hole states and the outermost large black hole states exhibit stable thermodynamic behavior. In the low-temperature limit, all three cases exhibit a thermodynamically stable small black hole state. Conversely, in the high-temperature limit, each system admits a thermodynamically stable large black hole state. Through this analysis, we have rigorously shown that static neutral, charged, and rotating BTZ black holes are consistently classified within the $W^{1+}$ category. Our results demonstrate that neither the charge parameter nor the rotation parameter exerts significant influence on the universal thermodynamic topological classification of three-dimensional static neutral BTZ black holes. This reveals a fundamental dichotomy: while angular momentum and electric charge dominate the thermodynamic topology of four-dimensional static black holes, their effects become negligible in the three-dimensional static BTZ case, highlighting a dimension-driven divergence in black hole thermodynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Testing redshift variation of the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity relations of quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars serve as important cosmological probes and constructing accurate luminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the coefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could introduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray luminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$) relations of quasars. For the standard $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation, we find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with redshift, which is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally, we examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relations and find that the inclusion of a redshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, as the relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we construct a new $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation in which the redshift evolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. Calibrating the luminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that quasars utilizing our new relation yield effective constraints on cosmological parameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike constraints derived from the standard relation.</description>

      <title>The path towards measuring the gravitational field of proton bunches at accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian law describing the gravitational interaction of non-relativistic (slowly moving) gravitating matter, has been tested in many laboratory experiments with very high precision. In contrast, the post Minkowskian predictions for the gravitational field of ultra-relativistic matter, dominated by momentum instead of rest mass, have not been tested directly yet. The intense ultra-relativistic proton beam in the LHC storage ring offers the potential to test general relativity and alternative gravitational theories in this parameter regime for the first time in controlled lab-scale experiments. If successful, this would open the road to a novel use case of the LHC, where non-trivial gravitational physics could be studied likely in a parasitic mode, without the necessity of dedicated filling patterns. While the technical challenges are formidable, they should also lead to the development of ultra-high-sensitive acceleration sensors with abundant applications in other parts of science and technology. The present document summarizes the status of the theoretical studies in this direction, points out the challenges, and possible ways of addressing them. It was submitted as a contribution to the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) 2026 Update.</description>

      <title>Statistical complexity as a probe of mass and phase structure in compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic study of the statistical complexity, originally introduced by L\'opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209, 321-326 (1995)], across a broad range of compact star models. We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lorentzian homogeneous metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. An almost abelian Lie group is a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelian ideal. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions.</description>

These spaces are invariant under the action of the three-parameter abelian group of motions and belong to the first type Bianchi spaces.

      <title>More fields are different: Stochastic view of multi-field inflationary scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios where stochastic effects play a crucial role. Peculiar to multi-field models, the noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields generically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts forever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of fields may fail to realise our observable Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can reproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in various analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models using a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to study the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the scale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior. In this context, the three-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears to be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the three-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_4$) variant by a factor of $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -6$, while the GT approach as a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with at least $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -8$ ($\mathcal{S}_3$) to $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -13$ ($\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and DESI-DR2 datasets.</description>

      <title>The 2D Lorentz-violating fermionic Casimir effect under thermal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we explore the dimensional projection method applied to a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with the CPT-even dimension-six extension. Due to the dimensional reduction of a fermionic system from $4D$ to $2D$, it is possible to study the influence of LIV on the Casimir effect under the MIT bag boundary condition model in a low-dimensional setting, where results are obtained without any approximations for a null-temperature system. Moreover, the Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system in a LIV context. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Ghostly interactions in (1+1) dimensional classical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical stability of two coupled scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms evolving in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In the first part, we characterise unquenched ghostly interactions and present numerical solutions that support the following statements. First, the classical instability is not instantaneous and can even be benign, i.e., free of finite-time singularities. Second, while the classical instability can cascade towards higher frequency excitations, it is not driven by high frequency modes: At fixed amplitude, high-frequency modes are more stable than low-frequency modes. In the second part, we demonstrate that the classical instability can be quenched by mass terms. In particular, we exemplify that heavy high-frequency ghost fields seem to not violate the decoupling theorem and can be integrated out classically. In the third part, we demonstrate how self-interactions can quench the instability, for instance, by postponing its onset to parametrically large times. Extrapolating numerical results at large but finite evolution time to infinite evolution time, we demonstrate that classical fluctuations around trivial and nontrivial field-theory vacua are increasingly long-lived with (i) smaller initial amplitude of fluctuations, (ii) higher initial frequency of fluctuations, (iii) larger masses of the fields, or (iv) weaker interaction coupling. Moreover, our numerical simulations for field-theoretical generalisations of some globally-stable ghostly mechanical models do not feature any instability.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Highly Magnified Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing has empowered telescopes to discover astronomical objects that are otherwise out of reach without being highly magnified by foreground structures. While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly magnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this Letter, we fill this gap and explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find that these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as smoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any electromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in some cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform signatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with current-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these rare, highly magnified GWs and could use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the usual horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a mode-sum prescription to directly compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for scalar fields in the Boulware vacuum. The method generalizes the recently developed extended coordinate method which was previously only applicable to Hartle-Hawking states. We exhibit the accuracy and efficiency of the method by calculating the RSET in sub-extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We find numerical evidence for the regularity of the RSET at the extremal horizon regardless of the field mass and its coupling. We employ our numerical results of the RSET to source the semi-classical Einstein equations, demonstrating that if the RSET is considered as a static perturbation, it will either de-extremalize the black hole, or convert it into a horizonless object.</description>

      <title>Application of Non-Linear Noise Regression in the Virgo Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in 2015, the International Gravitational-wave Network has made substantial strides in improving the sensitivity of ground-based detectors. Despite these advancements, many GW signals remain below the detection threshold due to environmental noise that limits sensitivity. In recent years, algorithms such as DeepClean have been developed to estimate and remove contamination from various noise sources, addressing linear, non-linear, and non-stationary coupling mechanisms. In this paper, we present noise reduction in the Virgo detector using DeepClean, serving as a preliminary step toward integrating Virgo into the online noise reduction pipeline for the O5 observing run. Our results demonstrate the applicability of DeepClean in Virgo O3b data, where noise was reconstructed from a total of 225 auxiliary witness channels. These channels were divided into 13 subsets, each corresponding to a specific frequency band, with training and subtraction performed layer-wise in a sequential manner. We observe that the subtraction improves the binary neutron star inspiral range by up to 1.3 Mpc, representing an approximately 2.5% increase. To ensure robust validation, we conduct an injection study with binary black hole waveforms. Matched-filter analyses of the injections showed an average improvement of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio, while parameter estimation confirmed that DeepClean introduces no bias in the recovered parameters. The successful demonstration provides a pathway for online non-linear noise subtraction in Virgo in the future observing runs.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution in spherically reduced 2D semiclassical gravity with negative central charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the semiclassical Schwarzschild geometry in the Boulware quantum state in the framework of two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The classical model is defined by the spherical reduction of Einstein's gravity sourced with conformal scalar fields. The expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the Boulware state is singular at the classical horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but when backreaction effects are considered, previous results have shown that the 2D geometry is horizonless and described by a non-symmetric wormhole with a curvature singularity on the other side of the throat. In this work we show that reversing the sign of the central charge of the conformal matter removes the curvature singularity of the 2D backreacted geometry, which happens to be horizonless and asymptotically flat. This result is consistent with a similar analysis recently performed for the CGHS model. We also argue the physical significance of negative central charges in conformal anomalies from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

Abstract: We anticipate that the data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. Numerous gravitational wave signals overlap in the time and/or frequency domain, and the possible correlation between them has to be taken into account during their detection and characterization. In this work, we present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge; it is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between a one-parameter family of (anti)-de Sitter Yang-Mills models and Einstein-Palatini gravity with matter, realized through In\"o\"nu-Wigner contraction of the (A)dS algebra. By setting the gauge group parameter $\alpha$ to zero, the gauge transformation of the potential becomes consistent with the transformation properties of the tetrad form and spin connection. We show that a sector of the Yang-Mills dynamics exists where the gauge fields acquire a geometric interpretation, and the full Yang-Mills symmetry gives rise to diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations. Finally, the corresponding dynamics is consistent with unimodular gravity.</description>

Abstract: We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from these solutions, we also construct new black holes, solutions of other DHOST theories, obtained via disformal transformations of the metric. In particular, we investigate two specific types of disformal transformations: the first leading to a theory where gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, the second to a Horndeski theory, where the equations of motion remain second order. The dynamics of axial perturbations can be formally related to the general relativistic equations of motion of axial perturbations in an effective metric. The causal structure of the effective metric differs from that of the background metric, leading to distinct gravitational and luminous horizons. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phase transition and Joule-Thomson expansion of a quantum corrected black hole in AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics in the extended phase space of a quantum corrected black hole (BH) proposed recently is presented in this work. Our study shows that the phase transition behavior of the BH is analogous to that of conventional Schwarzschild BH in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space; however, a critical temperature exists such that when the BH temperature exceeds this critical value, the small BH phase and the large BH phase become separated, and no phase transition occurs. Due to the introduction of the quantum parameter $\xi$, the BH equation of state splits into two branches. One branch reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS case as $\xi\to0$, with its phase transition pressure lower than the critical pressure; another branch's phase transition pressure is greater than the critical pressure. The study shows that the $T-r_{+}$ phase transition and heat capacity are similar to those of the Schwarzschild-AdS BH. The Joule-Thomson expansion is divided into two stages: in the earlier stage, the BH pressure increases until it reaches a maximum; in the later stage, the pressure gradually decreases. In each stage, the BH may undergo an inversion point, resulting in the inversion curve with two branches. In addition, each stage has a minimum inversion mass, below which any BH (in each respective stage) has no inversion point.</description>

      <title>A relativistic non-perturbative local model of fractons and its non-local perturbative hidden sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, from first principles, a covariant local model for scalar fractonic matter coupled to a symmetric tensor gauge field. The free gauge field action is just the one of the Blasi-Maggiore model. The scalar sector, describing fracton charges, is a non-trivial covariant generalization of Pretko's quartic model. Because the model has no quadratic term in the scalar field, a direct perturbative treatment fails. Remarkably, by performing a suitable change of variables, we demonstrate that the action can be driven to a perturbative effective action. However, at the price of carrying non-local interacting terms. We study the perturbative regime of the model first by analyzing the classical field equations and some possible simple solutions, which are in accordance with the expected immobile behavior of fractons. We also derive the fracton dispersion relation and, by playing with the parameters of the model, show that there are at least six distinct phases: one with two massive fractonic modes, one of them being tachyonic; one with massless states associated with a long-range attractive potential; a mixed phase with one massive and one massless state; another one where physical states of the scalar field cannot occur at all in the physical spectrum; a massive phase with states of two different masses; and second phase where the scalar field cannot be associated with physical particles, in spite of its mass being real. Moreover, we find evidence that fractonic bound states emerge in the model for some of these phases.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational back-reaction is magical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body systems. We show that non-local magic, which is supported by the quantum correlations is lower bounded by the non-flatness of entanglement spectrum and upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic is approximately equal to the rate of change of the minimal surface area in response to the change of cosmic brane tension in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft hairs are an intrinsic infrared feature of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study some of the subtleties surrounding one of the primary observables with which we can study their effects in the context of Einstein's gravity: the black hole shadow. First, we clarify the singular pathology associated with black holes with soft hairs and demonstrate that the metrics of linearly superrotated black holes are free of near-zone pathologies due to appropriate asymptotic falloff conditions being imposed on the event horizon. We then analytically construct the photon orbits around such black holes, derive the shadow equation for near-zone observers, and find that the linear superrotation hairs deform the circular shadow of a bald Schwarzchild black hole into an ellipse. This is in sharp contrast to their supertranslated counterparts, which only shift the position of the center of the circular shadow but do not change its shape. Our results suggest a richness to the observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Expectation Values and Super-Yang-Mills Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. While both experimental observations and numerical simulations have robustly confirmed its existence, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. Unraveling the theoretical origin of confinement continues to be a profound and longstanding challenge in both physics and mathematics. Motivated by recent advances in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we investigate the Wilson loop expectation values in the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite chemical potential, employing a holographic approach within the background of an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane. Our results reveal that quantum gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region significantly modify the holographic Wilson loop expectation values. These values exhibit an area-law behavior, indicative of a confining quark-antiquark potential. Within this framework, our findings suggest that confinement in the super-Yang-Mills theory arises as a consequence of near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane geometry.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon - a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon - within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the criterion for the applicability of the background subtraction method, not only the finiteness condition of the resulting Hamiltonian but also the condition for the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be reduced to the form amenable to much simpler analysis at infinity by using the covariant phase space formalism. With this, we further establish that the background subtraction method is as applicable as the covariant counterterm method not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black hole thermodynamics in both asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes. In addition, our framework also provides us with the first derivation of the universal expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action beyond Einstein's gravity. Among others, our findings have a far reaching impact on the shift in methodology for the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics, where the well justified background subtraction method by our wieldy criterion is supposed to be the favored choice compared to the covariant counterterm method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Towards the Double Copy Formulation for the Abelian Sector of Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23425</link>

Abstract: It has been shown that double field theory (DFT) action can be constructed in a perturbative manner up to cubic order by using double copy of Yang-Mills. This construction can also be extended by starting with higher-derivative Yang-Mills theory to obtain higher-derivative DFT action. In this work, I try to use this classical double copy formulation for Abelian subsector of heterotic DFT, starting with a Yang-Mills theory including a charged scalar field, namely (Y M + \phi^3) theory. Although the methods I used do not give an exact match, they give some promising results.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>
