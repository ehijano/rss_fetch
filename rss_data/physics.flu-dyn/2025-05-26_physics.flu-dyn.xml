      <title>Bayesian and non-Bayesian multi-fidelity surrogate models for multi-objective aerodynamic optimization under extreme cost imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic shape optimization in industry still faces challenges related to robustness and scalability. This aspect becomes crucial for advanced optimizations that rely on expensive high-fidelity flow solvers, where computational budget constraints only allow a very limited number of simulations within the optimization loop. To address these challenges, we investigate strategies based on multi-fidelity surrogate models. In particular, we focus on the case of extreme computational cost imbalance between the high- and low-fidelity models, which severely limits the maximum allowable number of high-fidelity function calls. To maximize the information extracted from the high-fidelity samples, we generate a reduced representation of the design space and use an adaptive infill strategy to smartly place the high-fidelity samples where they can best guide the optimization. Bayesian co-kriging and non-Bayesian multi-fidelity neural networks are trained by combining low- and high-fidelity models for a use-case consisting of a low Reynolds linear outlet guide vane at subsonic and transitional flow conditions. Coarse-mesh RANS simulations are used as low-fidelity model while RANS simulations with a transition model and automatically (feature-based) adapted meshes are chosen as the high-fidelity one. Each surrogate model is then associated to an infill strategy of its kind and a proper orthogonal decomposition of the shape parametrization is used to reduce by half the dimension of the problem. Based on inverted distance and hypervolume metrics, we find that the simpler co-kriging representation in conjunction with Bayesian infill yields better performance than the multi-fidelity neural network and the considered non-Bayesian method.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Sharp Interface Immersed Boundary Solver for Large Scale Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) facilitate the simulation of flows around stationary, moving, and deforming bodies on Cartesian grids. However, extending these simulations to the large grid sizes required for realistic flow problems remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present the implementation and acceleration of \emph{ViCar3D}, a sharp-interface immersed boundary solver, on graphical processing units (GPUs). Using OpenACC, CUDA, and CUDA-aware MPI, we port and optimize \emph{ViCar3D} to multi-GPU architectures. Verification and scalability studies are performed for two benchmark cases: two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow past a finite rectangular wing. For the latter, we observe an approximately 20$\times$ speedup (node-to-node comparison) relative to the CPU-based implementation. The GPU-accelerated solver is capable of simulating complex 3D flows with up to 200 million mesh points on a single node equipped with four GPUs, and strong and weak scaling tests demonstrate maximum scaling efficiencies of 92\% and 93\%, respectively, on multi-GPU systems.</description>

      <title>Locally Adaptive Non-Hydrostatic Shallow Water Extension for Moving Bottom-Generated Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a locally adaptive non-hydrostatic model and apply it to wave propagation generated by a moving bottom. This model is based on the non-hydrostatic extension of the shallow water equations (SWE) with a quadratic pressure relation, which is suitable for weakly dispersive waves. The approximation is mathematically equivalent to the Green-Naghdi equations. Applied globally, the extension requires solving an elliptic system of equations in the whole domain at each time step. Therefore, we develop an adaptive model that reduces the application area of the extension and by that the computational time. The elliptic problem is only solved in the area where the dispersive effect might play a crucial role. To define the non-hydrostatic area, we investigate several potential criteria based on the hydrostatic SWE solution. We validate and illustrate how our adaptive model works by first applying it to simulate a simple propagating solitary wave, where exact solutions are known. Following that, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach in more complicated cases involving moving bottom-generated waves, where measured laboratory data serve as reference solutions. The adaptive model yields similar accuracy as the global application of the non-hydrostatic extension while reducing the computational time by more than 50%.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Snow Transport and Accumulation: New Reduced-Order Models and Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling snow particle dynamics in the atmosphere remains a significant challenge for atmospheric scientists, hydrologists, and glaciologists. Temporally and spatially varying rates of snow transport, deposition, and erosion are driven by atmospheric turbulence and further complicated by inertial particle dynamics. Even with perfectly resolved wind fields, accurately predicting the fate of mobile snow particles in wind relies on semi-empirical assumptions embedded in diffeo-integro equations that contain numerical instabilities. The present research couples a modern approach to snow particle drag with model order reduction tools from nonlinear dynamical systems. Coupled with novel accumulation diagnostics, we provide a simplified framework of snow transport with well-defined simplification errors and rigorous physical meaning.</description>

      <title>A two-sided subgrid-scale model for mass transfer across fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of extremely thin concentration boundary layers at fluid interfaces for high local Peclet numbers is a severe obstacle for efficient and accurate numerical simulation of mass transfer processes in two-phase fluid systems. Especially challenging are liquid-liquid systems, in which thin concentration boundary layers can appear on both sides of the fluid interface under convection-dominated conditions. In those cases, the one-sided species concentrations at the interface are a-priori not even known approximately, but are determined by a conjugate mass transfer problem governed by interfacial jump conditions. We introduce a two-sided subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model for conjugate mass transfer at fluid interfaces that accurately computes the local mass transfer rates on moderate or coarse mesh resolutions even when very high concentration gradients in interface vicinity occur. For this purpose, SGS modeling is applied on both sides of an interface transmissive to passive scalars, such as the fluid interface, enabling the accurate capture of conjugate mass transfer across thin boundary layer on one or on both sides of the interface. We implement our approach in the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface-Tracking (ALE-IT) OpenFOAM module twoPhaseInterTrackFoam. We have made twoPhaseInterTrackFoam publicly available in our previous publication.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere: derivation and structure-preserving simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-distribution-function based mesoscopic finite-difference methods for partial differential equations: Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the idea of direct modeling with equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs) we develop a general framework of mesoscopic numerical method (MesoNM) for macroscopic partial differential equations (PDEs), including but not limited to nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (NCDE) and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs). Different from the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method, this kind of MesoNM is an EDF-based mesoscopic finite-difference (MesoFD) method, and through taking the moments of MesoFD scheme its macroscopic version, called MMFD method, can be derived directly. Both MesoFD scheme and MMFD schemes are muti-level FD methods, MesoFD scheme being mesoscopic, and MMFD scheme being its macroscopic form which has the form of the central FD scheme. They are unified FD schemes for PDEs and can be implicit or explicit forms as needed. The macroscopic moment equations (MEs) can be derived from the MesoFD or MMFD scheme through the Taylor expansion method, and the common PDEs can be recovered from the MEs by using direct Taylor expansion method. Moreover, the stability of MMFD scheme is analyzed for linear CDE with anisotropic diffusion, and the stability conditions of a two-level explicit MMFD scheme and a two-level $\theta$-MMFD scheme (hybrid explicit and implicit MMFD scheme) are obtained, respectively. Finally, we note that some existing lattice Boltzmann (LB) based macroscopic FD models for the NSEs and NCDE are the special cases of present MMFD, which can be considered as a unified framework of FD schemes for PDEs, from this point of view.</description>

      <title>Primitive variable regularization to derive novel Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that employ a vertical velocity expansion and derive additional so-called moment equations for the expansion coefficients. Among desirable analytical properties for such systems of equations are hyperbolicity, accuracy, correct momentum equation, and interpretable steady states. In this paper, we show analytically that existing models fail at different of these properties and we derive new models overcoming the disadvantages. This is made possible by performing a hyperbolic regularization not in the convective variables (as done in the existing models) but in the primitive variables. Via analytical transformations between the convective and primitive system, we can prove hyperbolicity and compute analytical steady states of the new models. Simulating a dam-break test case, we demonstrate the accuracy of the new models and show that it is essential for accuracy to preserve the momentum equation.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the dispersion of active suspensions with oscillatory flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined impact of axial stretching and cross-stream diffusion on the downstream transport of solute is termed Taylor dispersion. The dispersion of active suspensions is qualitatively distinct: viscous and external torques can establish non-uniform concentration fields with weighted access to shear, modifying mean drift and effective diffusivity. It would be advantageous to fine-tune the dispersion for systems such as bioreactors, where mixing or particle separation can improve efficacy. Here, we investigate the dispersion of active suspensions in a vertical channel driven by an oscillatory pressure gradient - Womersley flow - using gyrotactic swimmers (bottom-heavy cells subject to viscous torques). Preliminary experimental results reveal interesting dispersion phenomena, highly dependent on the oscillation parameters, motivating theoretical investigation. Employing Lagrangian simulations, we find that oscillatory flows can induce drift and increase lateral and downstream dispersion, with periodic mixing between left and right sides. Such flows can also be used to separate species with different motile behaviour. Eulerian numerical schemes typically require an approach to averaging in orientational space, such as generalised Taylor dispersion, with assumptions on translational and rotational time scales. For an oscillatory timescale commensurate with cell dynamics, we reveal the limitations of such approximations, beyond which the averaging techniques collapse.</description>

      <title>On the fragility of laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inviscid laminar flow is a stationary solution of the incompressible Euler equations whose streamlines foliate the fluid domain. Their structure on symmetric domains is rigid: all laminar flows occupying straight periodic channels are shear and on regular annuli they are circular. Laminarity can persist to slight deformations of these domains provided the base flow is Arnold stable and non-stagnant (non-vanishing velocity). On the other hand, flows with trivial net momentum (and thus stagnate) break laminarity by developing islands (regions of contractible streamlines) on all non-flat periodic channels with up/down reflection symmetry. Here, we show that stable steady states occupying generic channels or annuli and stagnate must have islands. Additionally, when the domain is close to symmetric, we characterize the size of the islands, showing that they scale as the square root of the boundary's deviation from flat. Taken together, these results show that dynamically stable laminar flows are structurally unstable whenever they stagnate.</description>

      <title>Finding the Underlying Viscoelastic Constitutive Equation via Universal Differential Equations and Differentiable Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM), Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT), through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement. Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of UDEs in rheological modeling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of coalescence and pinch-off processes of a self-rewetting drop interacting with a liquid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs), such as long-chain aqueous alcohols, are a special class of liquids with surface tension that is anomalously dependent quadratically on temperature, resulting in thermocapillary flows that differ significantly from those in normal fluids (NFs). This study focuses on investigating the behavior of SRF drops interacting with a liquid layer under nonuniform heating conditions. In this regard, we employ a robust central moment-based lattice Boltzmann method with a phase-field model expressed in an axisymmetric formulation to capture three-dimensional effects efficiently. We investigate the coalescence and pinch-off processes in SRFs and compare them to those in NFs. Our simulations reveal that SRFs undergo pinch-off earlier than NFs. We also observe that increasing the Ohnesorge number Oh suppresses the pinch-off process, highlighting the relative role of viscous forces, which is modulated by gravity effects or the Bond number Bo. Furthermore, we explore how varying the dimensionless linear and quadratic sensitivity coefficients of surface tension on temperature, M1 and M2, respectively, and the dimensionless heat flux Q influence the coalescence/pinch-off behavior. Interestingly, contrary to the behavior in NFs, in SRFs increasing M2, or Q reduces the time required to pinch-off and widens the region in the Oh-Bo regime map where pinch-off occurs, when compared to the unheated cases. These differences are shown to be due to the variations in the thermocapillary forces on the interface. Overall, we find that under nonuniform heating, the SRFs enhance the pinch-off process compared to NFs across a wider range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.</description>

      <title>TripNet: Learning Large-scale High-fidelity 3D Car Aerodynamics with Triplane Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to accelerate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Existing 3D geometric learning models based on point clouds, voxels, meshes, or graphs depend on explicit geometric representations that are memory-intensive and resolution-limited. For large-scale simulations with millions of nodes and cells, existing models require aggressive downsampling due to their dependence on mesh resolution, resulting in degraded accuracy. We present TripNet, a triplane-based neural framework that implicitly encodes 3D geometry into a compact, continuous feature map with fixed dimension. Unlike mesh-dependent approaches, TripNet scales to high-resolution simulations without increasing memory cost, and enables CFD predictions at arbitrary spatial locations in a query-based fashion, independent of mesh connectivity or predefined nodes. TripNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DrivAerNet and DrivAerNet++ datasets, accurately predicting drag coefficients, surface pressure, and full 3D flow fields. With a unified triplane backbone supporting multiple simulation tasks, TripNet offers a scalable, accurate, and efficient alternative to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>

Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Despite being a fundamental issue in convective organization, the self-aggregation of clouds lacks a theoretical explanation due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce an idealized mathematical model where the system's state is represented solely by the vertically integrated water vapor content of atmospheric columns under the weak temperature gradient approximation. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidate the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns induces bistability, leading to dry and moist equilibria. This reflects the circulation effects driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state realizes when destabilization by nonlocal coupling, triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state, overcomes stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems where all columns are equally coupled, perturbations with the maximum wavelength exhibit the highest growth rate. This results in a solution with an infinitely long wavelength, understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. Conversely, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbations with wavelengths close to the characteristic length of the coupling are preferred. The results reveal that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation. Moreover, this study suggests a physical similarity between convective self-aggregation and moisture mode.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Reconstruction of Full-Field Tsunami Waves from Sparse Tsunameter Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of an attention-based neural network architecture, the Senseiver, for sparse sensing in tsunami forecasting. Specifically, we focus on the Tsunami Data Assimilation Method, which generates forecasts from tsunameter networks. Our model is used to reconstruct high-resolution tsunami wavefields from extremely sparse observations, including cases where the tsunami epicenters are not represented in the training set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the Linear Interpolation with Huygens-Fresnel Principle in generating dense observation networks, achieving markedly improved accuracy.</description>

      <title>The electrostatic charge on exuded liquid drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with systematic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by material-dependent electrostatic processes.</description>
