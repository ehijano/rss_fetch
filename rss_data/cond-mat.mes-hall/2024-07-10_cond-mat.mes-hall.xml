      <title>Non-Hermitian $\mathbb{Z}_4$ skin effect protected by glide symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although nonsymmorphic symmetry protects $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topology for Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian topological phenomena induced by such a unique topological structure remain elusive. In this paper, we elucidate that systems with glide symmetry exhibit non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSE) characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topology. Specifically, numerically analyzing a two-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topology induces the NHSE when the topological invariant takes $\nu=1,2$. Furthermore, our numerical analysis demonstrates that the NHSE is destroyed by perturbations preserving the relevant symmetry when the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-invariant takes $\nu=4$.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial plasmon polaritons $\textit{via}$ charge transfer at the graphene/CrSBr interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a privileged 2D platform for hosting confined light-matter excitations known as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), as it possesses low intrinsic losses with a high degree of optical confinement. However, the inherently isotropic optical properties of graphene limit its ability to guide and focus SPPs, making it less suitable than anisotropic elliptical and hyperbolic materials as a platform for polaritonic lensing and canalization. Here, we present the graphene/CrSBr heterostructure as an engineered 2D interface that hosts highly anisotropic SPP propagation over a wide range of frequencies in the mid-infrared and terahertz. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate mutual doping in excess of 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ holes/electrons between the interfacial layers of graphene/CrSBr heterostructures. SPPs in graphene activated by charge transfer interact with charge-induced anisotropic intra- and interband transitions in the interfacial doped CrSBr, leading to preferential SPP propagation along the quasi-1D chains that compose each CrSBr layer. This multifaceted proximity effect both creates SPPs and endows them with anisotropic transport and propagation lengths that differ by an order-of-magnitude between the two in-plane crystallographic axes of CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electron Spin Relaxation by Chiral Phonons in WSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor monolayers the spin dynamics of electrons is controlled by the original spin-valley locking effect resulting from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and inversion asymmetry. As a consequence, for electrons occupying bottom conduction bands, a carrier spin flip occurs only if there is a simultaneous change of valley. However, very little is known about the intra-valley spin relaxation processes. In this work we have performed stationary and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements in high quality WSe$_2$ monolayers. Our experiments highlight an efficient relaxation from bright to dark excitons, due to a fast intra-valley electron transfer from the top to the bottom conduction band with opposite spins. A combination of experiments and theoretical analysis allows us to infer a spin relaxation time of about $\tau_s\sim10~$ps, driven by the interplay between $\Gamma$-valley chiral phonons and spin-orbit mixing.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Vortices Host Magnetoelectric Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector cross product and pseudoscalar dot products of electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields are separately finite in vacuum transverse electric and magnetic (TEM) plane waves, and angular momentum structured light. Current theories of interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics invoke non-zero dot(E,H) as the source term in the axion law that describes interactions with the cosmological dark matter axion particles outside of the quartet of Maxwells equations. The non-zero dot(E,H) also drives relativistic spin-charge magnetoelectric excitations of axion quasiparticles at a distinctively higher condensed matter scale in magnetic and topological materials. Yet, how to drive coherent dot(E,H) responses is unknown, and provides motivation to examine the field polarizations in structured light on a deep sub-diffraction limited spatial scale and sub-optical cycle temporal scale by ultrafast nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy. By analytical theory and ultrafast coherent photoemission electron microscopy, we image dot(E,H) fields in surface plasmon polariton vortex cores at subwavelength scales, where we find that the magnetoelectric relative to the dipole density is intensified on a ~10 nm diameter scale as a universal property of plasmonic vortex fields. The generation and nanoscale localization of dot(E,H) fields introduces the magnetoelectric symmetry class, having the parity and time reversal broken, but the joint parity-time reversal symmetry preserved. The ability to image the optical fields of plasmonic vortex cores opens the research of ultrafast microscopy of magnetoelectric responses and interactions with axion quasiparticles in solid state materials.</description>

      <title>A Toy Model for the 2/3 Fractional Quantum Hall edge channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal model capturing the intriguing physics of the fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor $\nu=2/3$. Inserting fictive reservoirs \textemdash either Landauer Reservoirs (LRs) or Energy Preservings Reservoirs (EPRs) \textemdash along the counter-propagating modes to mimic edge channel mixing, the conductance is shown rapidly converging towards the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski conductance fixed point $2/3 \times (e^2/h$) for both EPRs and LRs. However, LRs give equal charge and thermal relaxation lengths while EPRs show infinite thermal relaxation length. The Hall bar current noise is found varying linearly with current at large bias, leading to an apparent (or Fake) Fano factor $\simeq 0.19.../\sqrt{N+1}$ for N LRs, or exponentially vanishing for EPRs. Withal, inserting a Quantum Point Contact in the middle of the Hall bar reveals the recently observed $0.5e^{2}/h$ conductance plateau. Finally, the 2010 Bid et al. first reported observation of neutral modes can be explained by an upstream diffusive heat flow and delta-T noise, without introducing any specific collective neutral mode.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of spin-polarized light-emitting diodes based on a 2D CrI3/hBN/WSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs) convert the electronic spin information to photon circular polarization, offering potential applications including spin amplification, optical communications, and advanced imaging. The conventional control of the emitted light's circular polarization requires a change in the external magnetic field, limiting the operation conditions of spin-LEDs. Here, we demonstrate an atomically thin spin-LED device based on a heterostructure of a monolayer WSe2 and a few-layer antiferromagnetic CrI3, separated by a thin hBN tunneling barrier. The CrI3 and hBN layers polarize the spin of the injected carriers into the WSe2. With the valley optical selection rule in the monolayer WSe2, the electroluminescence exhibits a high degree of circular polarization that follows the CrI3 magnetic states. Importantly, we show an efficient electrical tuning, including a sign reversal, of the electroluminescent circular polarization by applying an electrostatic field due to the electrical tunability of the few-layer CrI3 magnetization. Our results establish a new platform to achieve on-demand operation of nanoscale spin-LED and electrical control of helicity for device applications.</description>

      <title>Transformation of a cellular skyrmion to polyomino-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin structures with transformable shapes may have potential implications on data storage and computation. Here, we demonstrate that a square cellular skyrmion on an artificial grid pinning pattern can be manipulated by programmed current pulses. We find that parallel short pulses could result in the elongation of the skyrmion mainly in the current direction, while parallel long pulses are able to induce the elongation in the direction perpendicular to the current due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall effect. Consequently, a programmed sequence of parallel pulses could lead to the transformation of the skyrmion to I-, L-, and Z-shaped polyomino-like structures without affecting the topological charge. In addition, we find that orthogonal pulses could lead to the transformation to more complex polyomino-like structures, including the T-shaped and irregular ones. Particularly, when a small T-shaped structure is formed, the topological charge of the system is found to be non-integer due to incomplete compensation of local topological charge densities; however, the T-shaped structure is stable on the attractive pinning pattern. Our results offer an effective way to create polyomino-like spin structures toward functional applications.</description>

      <title>Bimerons create bimerons: proliferation and aggregation induced by currents and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregation of topological spin textures at nano and micro scales has practical applications in spintronic technologies. Here, the authors report the in-plane current-induced proliferation and aggregation of bimerons in a bulk chiral magnet. It is found that the spin-transfer torques can induce the proliferation and aggregation of bimerons only in the presence of an appropriate out-of-plane magnetic field. It is also found that a relatively small damping and a relatively large non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque could lead to more pronounced bimeron proliferation and aggregation. Particularly, the current density should be larger than a certain threshold in order to trigger the proliferation; namely, the bimerons may only be driven into translational motion under weak current injection. Besides, the authors find that the aggregate bimerons could relax into a deformed honeycomb bimeron lattice with a few lattice structure defects after the current injection. The results are promising for the development of bio-inspired spintronic devices that use a large number of aggregate bimerons. The findings also provide a platform for studying aggregation-induced effects in spintronic systems, such as the aggregation-induced lattice phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum dot junctions capacitively coupled to a resonator, electron tunneling through the quantum dot can be used to transfer heat between different parts of the system. This includes cooling or heating the electrons in electrodes and absorbing or emitting photons in the resonator mode. Such systems can be driven into a nonequilibrium state by applying either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient across the electrodes coupled to the quantum dot, or by employing an external coherent pump to excite the resonator. In this study, we present a semiclassical theory to describe the steady state of these structures. We employ a combination of the Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's functions method and semiclassical laser theory to analyze a normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor junction coupled to a resonator. Our investigation focuses on key parameters such as the average photon number and phase shift in the resonator, the charge current in the quantum dot, and the heat fluxes among different components of the system. We explore how photon-assisted Andreev reflection and quasiparticle tunneling in the quantum dot can refrigerate the resonator mode and the normal metal electrode. We also examine the influence of finite voltage and thermal biases on these processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunneling of the massless Dirac fermions through a vector potential barrier are theoretically investigated, where the vector potential can be introduced by the very high and very thin (delta-function) magnetic potential barriers. We show that, distinct from the previously studied electric barrier tunneling, the vector potential barriers are more transparent for pseudospin-1/2 Dirac fermions but more obstructive for pseudospin-1 Dirac fermions. By tuning the height of the vector potential barrier, the pseudospin-1/2 Dirac fermions remain transmitted, whereas the transmission of the pseudospin-1 Dirac fermions is forbidden, leading to a pseudospin filtering effect for massless Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Structure of crystalline water ice formed through neon matrix sublimation under cryogenic and vacuum conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice I has three forms depending on the stacking arrangements of its layers: hexagonal ice Ih, cubic ice Ic, and stacking disordered ice Isd. Below ~60 K, amorphous water becomes metastable, and the formation of any form of ice I is often implicitly precluded. Using a newly developed low-temperature reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique, we show that crystalline ice with cubic stacking sequences (i.e., ice Ic) formed through Ne sublimation from a solid H2O/Ne (1:1000 ratio) matrix at 13 K. The extent of staking disorder (disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences) in the ice formed by Ne matrix sublimation is smaller than that in vapor-deposited ice Isd prepared at 143 K and below the limit of detection of low-temperature RHEED. Dependence of the resulting ice structures on the thickness of the H2O/Ne matrix shows that amorphous water first forms in the early stages of Ne sublimation and the cubic stacking sequence subsequently takes place. As the cubic ice Ic formed here at a much lower temperature (13 K) than previously observed (typically above 78 K), Ne matrix sublimation represents a novel route to the formation of cubic ice Ic under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein bottle Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) insulator phase plays a pivotal role in understanding higher-order topological phases. The insulator phase is characterized by a unique feature: a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry that exists within momentum space, rather than real space. This characteristic transforms the Brillouin zone's fundamental domain into a structure of Klein bottle. Here, we report an observation of a Klein bottle topoelectrical model under gauge fields. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the different corner distributions of odd and even unit cells, we present theoretical calculations and demonstrate that the symmetry properties significantly affect the topological nature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results, which demonstrate the practical feasibility of such topological configurations in electronic circuits. Our work establishes a vital connection between the realms of condensed matter physics and circuit systems, thereby paving a pathway for investigating exotic condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Hole Gas on Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance in (Cd,Mn)Te Based Quantum Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a useful technique for studying interactions between local spins (magnetic ions) and carrier gas. We present the ODMR study of single (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QWs) with the hole gas. We observe different characteristics of the ODMR signals obtained simultaneously using the optical signals of neutral and positively charged exciton. From that, we infer an existence of local fluctuations of carrier gas density resulting in separate populations of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. At the same time, the shape of the ODMR signal contains information about the temperature of the magnetic ions involved in the absorption of the MW. Studying it in detail provides even more information about the interactions with charge carriers. In the QW, two separate ensembles of ions are thermalized differently in the presence of carriers.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric cooling of a finite reservoir coupled to a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium transport of charge and heat through an interacting quantum dot coupled to a finite electron reservoir. Both the quantum dot and the finite reservoir are coupled to conventional electric contacts, i.e., infinite electron reservoirs, between which a bias voltage can be applied. We develop a phenomenological description of the system, combining a rate equation for transport through the quantum dot with standard linear response expressions for transport between the finite and infinite reservoirs. The finite reservoir is assumed to be in a quasi-equilibrium state with time-dependent chemical potential and temperature which we solve for self-consistently. We show that the finite reservoir can have a large impact on the stationary state transport properties, including a shift and broadening of the Coulomb diamond edges. We also demonstrate that there is a region around the conductance lines where a heat current flows out of the finite reservoir. Our results reveal the dependence of the temperature that can be reached by this thermoelectric cooling on the system parameters, in particular the coupling between the finite and infinite reservoirs and additional heat currents induced by electron-phonon couplings, and can thus serve as a guide to experiments on quantum dot-enabled thermoelectric cooling of finite electron reservoirs. Finally, we study the full dynamics of the system, with a particular focus on the timescales involved in the thermoelectric cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high harmonic generation in altermagnetic metals with and without spin-orbit coupling. The altermagnetism manifests itself in the magnetic field dependence of the low harmonics associated with intra-band dynamics. Spin-orbit coupling leads to additional higher energy peaks and plateau structures originating from inter-band transitions. While the pure altermagnet or spin-orbit system exhibits no circular dichroism in the high-harmonic response, an altermagnetic system with spin-orbit coupling shows such a dichroism. We also analyze the spin currents and their high harmonic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dual approach to soft-core anyonic Lieb-Liniger fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identity of quantum matter can be effectively altered by means of gauge fields. In two spatial dimensions this is illustrated by the Chern-Simons flux-attachment mechanism, but such a mechanism is not possible in lower dimensions. Here, we study a one-dimensional interacting Bose gas in the presence of a gauge field. This model can be explicitly mapped into an interacting anyonic system by a large gauge transformation, indicating a statistical transmutation analogous to that of Chern-Simons. The Bogoliubov spectrum in the weakly-interacting limit reveals the presence of a roton minimum arising from the statistical interaction. At a mean-field level chiral solitons are recovered. Should these be understood as quantum bound states, it is natural to interpret them as corresponding to localised anyonic quasiparticles. Hydrodynamic arguments highlight the presence of dispersive chiral shock waves in the propagation of a wavepacket due to a Riemann-Hopf nonlinearity. Numerical calculations show the presence of both chiral soliton trains and shock waves.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting impurity spins adsorbed on surfaces have been suggested as basic components for applications in quantum computation and spintronics. Such spins usually prefer a parallel or antiparallel configuration, but weakly non-collinear alignments are possible due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that arises in the presence of relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that an effective DMI can emerge purely from superconducting correlations without any spin-orbit interaction. We give an analytical proof and provide a numerical study which shows that DMI arises in mixed-parity superconductors solely from the superconducting pairing. These results enable a way to engineer spin textures using the superconducting phase transition.</description>

      <title>Cyclic solid-state quantum battery: Thermodynamic characterization and quantum hardware simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Infrared band strengths of dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm-1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called dangling OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm-1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 plus-minus 1.6 times 10-18 and 9.1 plus-minus 1.0 times 10-18 cm molecule-1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680-3620 cm-1, with a band strength of 1.8 plus-minus 0.1 times 10-17 cm molecule-1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.</description>

      <title>Large spin-orbit torque in a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Pt bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realization of efficient spin-orbit torque switching of the N\'eel vector in insulating antiferromagnets is a challenge, often complicated by spurious effects. Quantifying the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet/heavy metal heterostructures is an important first step towards this goal. Here, we employ magneto-optic techniques to study damping-like spin-orbit torque (DL-SOT) in a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematite) with a Pt spin-orbit overlayer. We find that the DL-SOT efficiency is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in c- and r-plane hematite/Pt using harmonic Hall techniques. The large magnitude of DL-SOT is supported by direct imaging of current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domains that happens at moderate current densities. Our study introduces a new method for quantifying spin-orbit torque in antiferromagnets with a small canted moment and identifies a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ as a promising candidate to realize efficient SOT switching.</description>

      <title>In-plane staging in lithium-ion intercalation of bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing efforts to optimize Li-ion batteries led to the interest in intercalation of nanoscale layered compounds, including bilayer graphene. Its lithium intercalation has been demonstrated recently but the mechanisms underpinning the storage capacity remain poorly understood. Here, using magnetotransport measurements, we report in-operando intercalation dynamics of bilayer graphene. Unexpectedly, we find four distinct intercalation stages that correspond to well-defined Li-ion densities. We refer to these stages as 'in-plane', with no in-plane analogues in bulk graphite. The fully intercalated bilayers represent a stoichiometric compound C14LiC14 with a Li density of 2.7x10^{14} cm^{-2}, notably lower than fully intercalated graphite. Combining the experimental findings and DFT calculations, we show that the critical step in bilayer intercalation is a transition from AB to AA stacking which occurs at a density of 0.9x10^{14} cm^{-2}. Our findings reveal the mechanism and limits for electrochemical intercalation of bilayer graphene and suggest possible avenues for increasing the Li storage capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric of single-particle wave functions in topological flatbands plays a crucial role in determining the stability of fractional Chern insulating (FCI) states. Here, we unravel that the quantum metric causes the many-body Chern number of the FCI states to deviate sharply from the expected value associated with partial filling of the single-particle topological flatband. Furthermore, the variation of the quantum metric in momentum space induces band dispersion through interactions, affecting the stability of the FCI states. This causes a reentrant transition into the Fermi liquid from the FCI phase as the interaction strength increases.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal Photonic Crystal Mirrors: Scalable Lightsails with Enhanced Acceleration via Neural Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starshot Breakthrough Initiative aims to send one-gram microchip probes to Alpha Centauri within 20 years, using gram-scale lightsails propelled by laser-based radiation pressure, reaching velocities nearing a fifth of light speed. This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale. Here we highlight challenges and possible solutions in developing lightsail materials - showcasing the potential of scaling nanophotonics for cost-effective next-generation space exploration.</description>

Abstract: The collective tunneling of a Wigner necklace - a crystal-like state of a small number of strongly interacting electrons confined to a suspended nanotube and subject to a double well potential - is theoretically analyzed and compared with experiments in [Shapir \emph{et al.}, Science {\bf 364}, 870 (2019)]. Density Matrix Renormalization Group computations, exact diagonalization, and instanton theory provide a consistent description of this very strongly interacting system, and show good agreement with experiments. Experimentally extracted and theoretically computed tunneling amplitudes exhibit a scaling collapse. Collective quantum fluctuations renormalize the tunneling, and substantially enhance it as the number of electrons increases.</description>

Abstract: The circularly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is studied in chiral Weyl semimetals with short-ranged quenched disorder. Without disorder, the topological properties of chiral Weyl semimetals lead to the quantization of the CPGE, which is a second-order optical response. Using a combination of diagrammatic perturbation theory in the continuum and exact numerical calculations via the kernel polynomial method on a lattice model we show that disorder perturbatively destabilizes the quantization of the CPGE.</description>

Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum computation and have been used to confine individual charges in a planar array. Here, we demonstrate control over vertical double quantum dots confined in a double quantum well, silicon-germanium heterostructure. We sense individual charge transitions with a single-hole transistor. The vertical separation between the quantum wells provides a sufficient difference in capacitive coupling to distinguish quantum dots located in the top and bottom quantum well. Tuning the vertical double quantum dot to the (1,1) charge state confines a single hole in each quantum well beneath a single plunger gate. By simultaneously accumulating holes under two neighbouring plunger gates, we are able to tune to the (1,1,1,1) charge state. These results motivate quantum dot systems that exploit the third dimension, opening new opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Valley chiral kagom\'e networks can arise in various situations, like for example, in double-aligned graphene-hexagonal boron nitride and periodically strained graphene. Here, we construct a phenomenological scattering model based on the symmetries of the network to investigate the energy spectrum and magnetotransport in this system. Additionally, we consider the effects of a finite Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the transport properties of the kagom\'e network. We identify conditions where the interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the geometry of the lattice results in a reduction of the periodicity of the magnetoconductance and characteristic sharp resonances. Moreover, we find a finite spin-polarization of the conductance, which could be exploited in spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical electrodynamics describes the optical response of systems using bulk electronic properties and infinitesimally thin boundaries. However, due to the quantum nature of electrons, interfaces have a finite thickness. Non-classical surface effects become increasingly important as ever smaller nanoscale systems are realized and eventually dominate over volume-related phenomena. Investigating the response of surface electrons in such systems, therefore, becomes imperative. One way to gain control over non-classical interface effects and study them is through electrical gating, as the static screening charges reside exclusively at the surface. Here, we investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electric charging of a single plasmonic nanoresonator by measuring the resulting changes in resonance. We analyze the observed effects within the general framework of surface-response functions and provide a basic model derived from electron spill-out within the local-response approximation (LRA). Our observed change in resonance frequency is well accounted for by assuming a modulation of the in-plane surface current. Surprisingly, we also measure a change in the resonance width, where adding electrons to the surface leads to a narrowing of the plasmonic resonance, i.e., reduced losses. The description of such effects requires considering nonlocal effects and the inclusion of a possible anisotropy of the perturbed surface permittivity. Our experiment, therefore, opens a vast field of investigations on how to gain control over the surface response in plasmonic resonators and to develop ultrafast and extremely small electrically driven plasmonic modulators and metasurfaces by leveraging electrical control over non-classical surface effects.</description>

      <title>Electronic interactions in Dirac fluids visualized by nano-terahertz spacetime interference of electron-photon quasiparticles</title>

Abstract: Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical Dirac fluid of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect the charge dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its electron-photon collective modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Here we show that polaritonic interference patterns are particularly well suited to unveil the interactions in Dirac fluids by tracking polaritonic interference in time at temporal scales commensurate with the electronic scattering. Spacetime SPP interference patterns recorded in tera-hertz (THz) frequency range provided unobstructed readouts of the group velocity and lifetime of polariton that can be directly mapped onto the electronic spectral weight and the relaxation rate. Our data uncovered prominent departures of the electron dynamics from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes are approximately equal. The proposed spacetime imaging methodology can be broadly applied to probe the electrodynamics of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>From Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Smectics to Polar Smectic Metals: Nontrivial Interplay Between Electronic Liquid Crystal Order and Topological Order in Correlated Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking orders can not only compete with each other, but also be interwined, and the interwined topological and symmetry-breaking orders make the situation more intriguing. This work examines the archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling $\nu=2/3$ and we find the unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise to two novel quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) state, where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order with enlarged ground-state degeneracy and interestingly, the Hall conductivity is $\sigma_{xy}=\nu=2/3$, different from the band-folding or doping scenarios. Further increasing the interaction strength, the system undergoes another quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal (PSM) state. This emergent PSM is an anisotropic non-Fermi liquid, whose interstripe tunneling is irrelevant while it is metallic inside each stripe. Different from the FQAHS and conventional smectic orders, this PSM spontaneously breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to the exotic ground states, large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations and thermodynamic characteristics. We find the onset temperature of the incompressible FQAHS state, which also coincides with the onset of non-polar smectic order, is dictated by the magneto-roton modes. Above this onset temperature, the PSM state exists at intermediate-temperature regime. Although the T = 0 quantum phase transition between PSM and FQAHS is first order, the thermal FQAHS-PSM transition could be continuous. We expect the features of the exotic states and thermal phase transitions could be accessed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing magnetism in moir\'e heterostructures with quantum twisting microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-ordered states close to metal-insulator transitions are poorly understood theoretically and challenging to probe in experiments. Here, we propose that the quantum twisting microscope, which provides direct access to the energy-momentum resolved spectrum of single-particle and collective excitations, can be used as a novel tool to distinguish between different types of magnetic order. To this end, we calculate the single-particle spectral function and the dynamical spin-structure factor for both a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic generalized Wigner crystal formed in fractionally filled moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. We demonstrate that magnetic order can be clearly identified in these response functions. Furthermore, we explore signatures of quantum phase transitions in the quantum twisting microscope response. We focus on the specific case of triangular moir\'e lattices at half filling, which have been proposed to host a topological phase transition between a chiral spin liquid and a 120 degree ordered state. Our work demonstrates the potential for quantum twisting microscopes to characterize quantum magnetism in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands, valley polarization, and interband superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximitized spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings on the top layer. Topological flat bands (with three distinct phases) are generically realized by the spin-orbit couplings. Using a mean field analysis, we find that (partial) valley polarization prevails for a wide range of doping, suppressing the usual superconductivity with a pairing between time-reversal partners. Remarkably, we uncover that observable unconventional intervalley interband phonon-mediated superconductivity (with the highest $T_c\approx 1.2$K) can coexist with strong valley imbalance due to the approximate Fermi surface nesting between two flat bands not related by time-reversal symmetry, and the dominant pairing is an intersublattice Ising pairing, corresponding to a mixture of $p$- and $d$-waves. In contrast, the intrasublattice Ising phonon-mediated superconductivity with $s$- and $f$-wave mixing emerges in the absence of valley imbalance. Our work reveals an unprecedented route of realizing unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>
