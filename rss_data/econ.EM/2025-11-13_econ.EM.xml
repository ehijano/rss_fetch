      <title>Robust Cauchy-Based Methods for Predictive Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops robust inference methods for predictive regressions that address key challenges posed by endogenously persistent or heavy-tailed regressors, as well as persistent volatility in errors. Building on the Cauchy estimation framework, we propose two novel tests: one based on $t$-statistic group inference and the other employing a hybrid approach that combines Cauchy and OLS estimation. These methods effectively mitigate size distortions that commonly arise in standard inference procedures under endogeneity, near nonstationarity, heavy tails, and persistent volatility. The proposed tests are simple to implement and applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time models. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance across a range of realistic settings. An empirical application examines the predictability of excess stock returns using the dividend-price and earnings-price ratios as predictors. The results suggest that the dividend-price ratio possesses predictive power, whereas the earnings-price ratio does not significantly forecast returns.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from the 2008 Financial Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in interconnected banking systems, yet existing frameworks fail to integrate spatial propagation with network contagion mechanisms. This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.</description>

      <title>Double Robustness of Local Projections and Some Unpleasant VARithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider impulse response inference in a locally misspecified vector autoregression (VAR) model. The conventional local projection (LP) confidence interval has correct coverage even when the misspecification is so large that it can be detected with probability approaching 1. This result follows from a "double robustness" property analogous to that of popular partially linear regression estimators. By contrast, the conventional VAR confidence interval with short-to-moderate lag length can severely undercover for misspecification that is small, difficult to detect statistically, and cannot be ruled out based on economic theory. The VAR confidence interval has robust coverage if, and only if, the lag length is so large that the interval is as wide as the LP interval.</description>

      <title>Weak instrumental variables due to nonlinearities in panel data: A Super Learner Control Function estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03228v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A triangular structural panel data model with additive separable individual-specific effects is used to model the causal effect of a covariate on an outcome variable when there are unobservable confounders with some of them time-invariant. In this setup, a linear reduced-form equation might be problematic when the conditional mean of the endogenous covariate and the instrumental variables is nonlinear. The reason is that ignoring the nonlinearity could lead to weak instruments (instruments are weakly correlated with the endogeneous covariate). As a solution, we propose a triangular simultaneous equation model for panel data with additive separable individual-specific fixed effects composed of a linear structural equation with a nonlinear reduced form equation. The parameter of interest is the structural parameter of the endogenous variable. The identification of this parameter is obtained under the assumption of available exclusion restrictions and using a control function approach. Estimating the parameter of interest is done using an estimator that we call Super Learner Control Function (SLCF) estimator. The estimation procedure is composed of two main steps and sample splitting. First, we estimate the control function using a super learner . In the following step, we use the estimated control function to control for endogeneity in the structural equation. Sample splitting is done across the individual dimension. The estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal achieving a parametric rate of convergence. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance of the estimators proposed. We conclude that the Super Learner Control Function Estimators significantly outperform Within 2SLS estimators.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Dynamic Structural Estimation: Serial Dependence and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributional assumptions that discipline serially correlated latent variables play a central role in dynamic structural models. We propose a framework to quantify the sensitivity of scalar parameters of interest (e.g., welfare, elasticity) to such distributional assumptions. We derive bounds on the scalar parameter by perturbing a reference distribution, while imposing a stationarity condition for time-homogeneous models or a Markovian condition for time-inhomogeneous models. The bounds are the solutions to optimization problems, for which we derive a computationally tractable dual formulation. We establish consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic distribution for the estimator of the bounds. We demonstrate the approach with two applications: an infinite-horizon dynamic demand model for new cars in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and a finite-horizon dynamic labor supply model for taxi drivers in New York City. In the car application, perturbed price elasticities deviate by at most 15.24% from the reference elasticities, while perturbed estimates of consumer surplus from an additional $3,000 electric vehicle subsidy vary by up to 102.75%. In the labor supply application, the perturbed Frisch labor supply elasticity deviates by at most 76.83% for weekday drivers and 42.84% for weekend drivers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>A data-driven merit order: Learning a fundamental electricity price model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting approaches generally fall into two categories: data-driven models, which learn from historical patterns, or fundamental models, which simulate market mechanisms. We propose a novel and highly efficient data-driven merit order model that integrates both paradigms. The model embeds the classical expert-based merit order as a nested special case, allowing all key parameters, such as plant efficiencies, bidding behavior, and available capacities, to be estimated directly from historical data, rather than assumed. We further enhance the model with critical embedded extensions such as hydro power, cross-border flows and corrections for underreported capacities, which considerably improve forecasting accuracy. Applied to the German day-ahead market, our model outperforms both classic fundamental and state-of-the-art machine learning models. It retains the interpretability of fundamental models, offering insights into marginal technologies, fuel switches, and dispatch patterns, elements which are typically inaccessible to black-box machine learning approaches. This transparency and high computational efficiency make it a promising new direction for electricity price modeling.</description>
