      <title>Vela: A Data-Driven Proposal for Joint Collaboration in Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UN Office of Outer Space Affairs identifies synergy of space development activities and international cooperation through data and infrastructure sharing in their Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG17). Current multilateral space exploration paradigms, however, are divided between the Artemis and the Roscosmos-CNSA programs to return to the moon and establish permanent human settlements. As space agencies work to expand human presence in space, economic resource consolidation in pursuit of technologically ambitious space expeditions is the most sensible path to accomplish SDG17. This paper compiles a budget dataset for the top five federally-funded space agencies: CNSA, ESA, JAXA, NASA, and Roscosmos. Using time-series econometric anslysis methods in STATA, this work analyzes each agency's economic contributions toward space exploration. The dataset results are used to propose a multinational space mission, Vela, for the development of an orbiting space station around Mars in the late 2030s. Distribution of economic resources and technological capabilities by the respective space programs are proposed to ensure programmatic redundancy and increase the odds of success on the given timeline.</description>

      <title>What are the real implications for $CO_2$ as generation from renewables increases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind and solar electricity generation account for 14% of total electricity generation in the United States and are expected to continue to grow in the next decades. In low carbon systems, generation from renewable energy sources displaces conventional fossil fuel power plants resulting in lower system-level emissions and emissions intensity. However, we find that intermittent generation from renewables changes the way conventional thermal power plants operate, and that the displacement of generation is not 1 to 1 as expected. Our work provides a method that allows policy and decision makers to continue to track the effect of additional renewable capacity and the resulting thermal power plant operational responses.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>
