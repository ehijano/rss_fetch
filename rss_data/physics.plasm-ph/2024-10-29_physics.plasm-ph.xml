      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. This work presents the design of a differential pumping system, enabling, for the first time, continuous operation of our kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system successfully maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>

      <title>Effects of size of an oxide layer on the surface properties of lithium irradiated by deuterium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and transformation in the frame of magnetohydrodynamics with a vortex electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright transient objects in different wave bands have been discovered in recent years. To explain these short (from ms to s), and very powerful events different models, galactic and extragalactic, have been considered. One of popular model is based on the suggestion of transformation of the magnetized plasma blob, presumably a MHD shock wave, moving with relativistic speed, into electromagnetic pulse after collision with some obstacle, or at entering in media with different properties. Such transformation cannot be described in the frame of classical MHD equations, which don't contain the displacement current, and don't include such transformation. Updating of the classic MHD equations by using of full set of Maxwell equation with displacement current, made recently by several authors, gave a possibility to describe hydrodynamic phenomena, together with electromagnetic ones by the same set of equations. Here we apply these equations for study of propagation of different waves with account of displacement current, and of transformation between different kind of waves in the nonuniform media. We derive a dispersion equation describing a propagation of a weak linear wave in a uniform magnetized plasma, and consider in details the cases with perpendicular and parallel motion to the magnetic field. It contains MHD, HD, Alfven and EM waves in the limiting cases, and some new types of behaviour in a general situation. We consider a plasma with zero viscosity and heat conductivity, with a finite scalar electric conductivity. We have shown, that transformation of MHD into EM wave may happen only in a highly magnetized plasma, and have found the region of parameters, where no waves exist, and only damping static perturbations may be present.</description>

      <title>Advanced surrogate model for electron-scale turbulence in tokamak pedestals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an advanced surrogate model for predicting turbulent transport at the edge of tokamaks driven by electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes.Our derivation is based on a recently developed sensitivity-driven sparse grid interpolation approach for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis at scale, which informs the set of parameters that define the surrogate model as a scaling law.Our model reveals that ETG-driven electron heat flux is influenced by the safety factor $q$, electron beta $\beta_e$, and normalized electron Debye length $\lambda_D$, in addition to well-established parameters such as the electron temperature and density gradients. To assess the trustworthiness of our model's predictions beyond training, we compute prediction intervals using bootstrapping. The surrogate model's predictive power is tested across a wide range of parameter values, including within-distribution testing parameters (to verify our model) as well as out-of-bounds and out-of-distribution testing (to validate the proposed model). Overall, validation efforts show that our model competes well with, or can even outperform, existing scaling laws in predicting ETG-driven transport.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal relaxation in warm ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform microscopic simulations of the thermal relaxation of warm neutral plasmas of astrophysical importance. Using Molecular Dynamics we study the thermal relaxation of a hot neutral fluid of finite-size neutron-rich ions kept in a fixed-wall cool box. We show how the interplay among particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understand the features of the time-dependent thermal relaxation curve $T(t)$. We show that, under certain conditions, these systems exhibit faster cooling from increasingly larger initial temperature values. They also display non-Newtonian thermal behavior, including oscillations, that can be {\it effectively} interpreted as the consequence of the existence of a non-trivial system memory function. Finally, we consider the impact of multicomponent admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and their possible extensions to astrophysical scenarios, where screened plasmas with Yukawa-like electrostatic potentials are usually involved.</description>

      <title>Observation of Kolmogorov turbulence due to multiscale vortices in dusty plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of fully developed Kolmogorov turbulence originating from self-excited vortex flows in a three-dimensional (3D) dust cloud. The characteristic -5/3 scaling of three-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence is universally observed in both the spatial and temporal power spectra. Additionally, the 2/3 scaling in the second-order structure function further confirms the presence of Kolmogorov turbulence. We also identified a slight deviation in the tails of the probability distribution functions for velocity gradients. The dust cloud formed in the diffused region away from the electrode and above the glass device surface in the glow discharge experiments. The dust rotation was observed in multiple experimental campaigns under different discharge conditions at different spatial locations and background plasma environments.</description>

      <title>FEQIS: A free-boundary equilibrium solver for integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new axisymmetric equilibrium solver has been written, called FEQIS (Flexible EQuIlibrium Solver), which purpose is to be used inside integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas. The FEQIS code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and the "circuit" equations for the external coils and passive conducting structures that are toroidally connected. The code has been specifically equipped with flexibility in choice of circuit connections, and a stripped-down numerical scheme for the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation through a structure of multi-level simplifications which can be tested against the required accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of the moments of runaway electron distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma current instabilities can destabilize the plasma discharge and cool the plasma rapidly. In such $\textit{disruptions}$ or in the start-up phase of the reactor, inductive electric fields are generated which accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities, resulting in a beam of $\textit{runaway electrons}$. This can potentially damage the reactor vessel and must be avoided in future reactors such as ITER. Thus, the efficient simulation of the evolution of the runaway electron current is motivated for prediction, avoidance and attenuation of disruptions. In order to improve simulations based on a self-consistent calculation of the runaway electron current, the efficient computation of the moments of analytical runaway electron distribution functions is of interest. In this respect, the general procedure is carried out through the example of the distribution function of the $\textit{avalanche}$ generation of runaway electrons according to $\textit{F\"ul\"op et al.}$. At this the runaway electron number density, the current density and the mean mass-related kinetic energy density, which result from the zeroth, first and second moment are considered. Their analysis is carried out analytically and numerically. By means of a ${\rm M{\small ATLAB}}$ implementation, suitable calculation rules are derived and analyzed with regard to runtime efficiency. Finally, a physical evaluation of the components and the magnitude of the current density vector as well as the kinetic energy density for the plasma parameter space constructed from electric field, electron density and electron temperature is carried out, applying the derived efficient calculation rules. In addition, the applicability of the selected distribution function is discussed on the basis of graphical depictions of the results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces Based on Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>
