      <title>Inverse source problems for a multidimensional time-fractional wave equation with integral overdetermination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two linear inverse problems for the time-fractional wave equation, assuming that its right-hand side takes the separable form $f(t)h(x)$, where $t \geq 0$ and $x \in \Omega \subset R^N $. The objective is to determine the unknown function $f(t)$ (Inverse Problem 1) and $h(x)$ (Inverse Problem 2), given that the other function is known.
  For Inverse Problem 1, we impose an overdetermination condition in the form of a spatial integral over the domain $\Omega $, involving the solution of the corresponding direct problem an initial-boundary value problem with standard Cauchy conditions and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The integral is weighted by the known spatial factor h(x) from the right-hand side of the equation. This choice of an additional condition enables the explicit construction of a solution to the inverse problem and allows us to prove its unique solvability within the class of regular solutions. To study the direct problem, the regular solution approach is used.
  For Inverse Problem 2, we introduce a novel integral-type additional condition, referred to as the time-averaged velocity, incorporating an appropriate weight function. The time-dependent factor of the right-hand side of the equation serves as this weight function. Depending on its choice, the additional condition reduces to specifying either the final-time offset or the time-averaged offset. Under this formulation, we establish a new uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Global Hypoellipticity and Solvability with Loss of Derivatives on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17466v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete characterization of global hypoellipticity and solvability with loss of derivatives for Fourier multiplier operators on the $n$-dimensional torus. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties and examine their connections with classical notions of global hypoellipticity and solvability, particularly in relation to the closedness of the operator's range.
  As an application, we explore the interplay between these properties and number theory in the context of differential operators on the two-torus. Specifically, we prove that the loss of derivatives in the solvability of the vector field $\partial_{x_1} - \alpha \partial_{x_2}$ is precisely determined by the well-known irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$ of its coefficient $\alpha$. Furthermore, we analyze the wave operator $\partial_{x_1}^2 - \eta^2 \Delta_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ and show how the loss of derivatives depends explicitly on the parameter $\eta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>On the inverse elastic problem for isotropic media using Eshelby and Lippmann-Schwinger integral formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two applications of the integro-differential volume equation for the eigenstrain, building on Eshelby's inclusion method [15,16], in the contexts of both static and dynamic linear elasticity. The primary objective is to address the inverse problem of recovering the elastic moduli of the inhomogeneity using a limited number of incident fields. In the static case, we adopt an efficient reformulation of Eshelby's equation proposed by Bonnet [7]. By employing a first-order approximation in addition with a limited number of incident loadings and measurements, we numerically determine the material coefficients of the inclusion. In elastodynamics, we focus on the inverse scattering problem, utilizing the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to reconstruct the elastic properties of the inclusion through a Newton-type iterative scheme. We construct the Frechet derivative and we formulate the linearized far-field equation. Additionally, the corresponding plane strain problems are analyzed in both static and dynamic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Stability of Gaussian Poincar\'{e} inequalities and Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with monimial weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Bakry-\'{E}mery curvature-dimension criterion and $\Gamma$-calculus to establish the Poincar\'{e} inequality with monomial Gaussian measure, and then apply the duality approach to study its improvements and its gradient stability. We also set up the scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequality with monomial Gaussian type measure and use it to inspect the stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with monomial weight. Finally, we apply the improved versions of the monomial Gaussian Poincar\'{e} inequality to investigate the improved stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with monomial weight. As special cases of our main results, we obtain the gradient stability of the classical Gaussian Poincar\'{e} inequality, which is of independent interest. Moreover, we also establish the stability of the sharp stability inequality of the classical Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle proved in [15].</description>

      <title>On long time behavior of solutions of the Schr\"odinger-KdV system with and without resonant interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long time behavior of the solutions of the coupled Schr\"odinger-KdV systems \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{llll}i\partial_tu+\partial^2_xu=\alpha uv+\beta u|u|^2,\hskip30pt (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^{+},\\ \partial_tv+\partial^3_xv+v\partial_xv=\gamma \partial_x(|u|^2), \hskip20pt (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^{+},\\ u, v)|_{t=0} =(u_{0}, v_{0}). \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} We show that global solutions to this system satisfy locally energy decay in a suitable interval, growing unbounded in time, in two situations. In the first case, we regard the parameter vector $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\in \mathbb{R}^{+}\times \overline{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\times \mathbb{R}^{+}$ without any size assumption on the initial data in $ H^{1}(\mathbb{R})\times H^{1}(\mathbb{R})$. In the second one, we consider the parameter vector $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\in \mathbb{R}^{+}\times \mathbb{R}^{-}\times \mathbb{R}^{+}$. In this case, we give a \lq\lq smallness" criterion involving the product of the parameter $-\beta$ and a constant depending on the initial data in $H^{1}(\mathbb{R})\times H^{1}(\mathbb{R})$. Our results answer positively the open questions raised in [F. Linares, A. J. Mendez, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53(2021) 3838-3855]. We use new ideas and different techniques from the latter paper.</description>

      <title>Extension theory via boundary triplets for infinite-dimensional implicit port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of constrained linear partial-differential equations can be described via parametric representations of linear relations. To study these representations, we provide a novel definition of boundary triplets for linear relations in range representations where the associated boundary map is defined on the domain of the parameterizing operators rather than the relation itself. This allows us to characterize all boundary conditions such that the underlying dynamics is represented by a self-adjoint, skew-adjoint or maximally dissipative relation. The theoretical results are applied to a class of implicit port-Hamiltonian systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. More precisely, we explicitly construct a boundary triplet which solely depends on the coefficient matrices of the involved matrix differential operators and we derive the associated Lagrangian subspace. We exemplify our approach by means of the Dzektser equation, the biharmonic wave equation, and an elastic rod with non-local elasticity condition.</description>

      <title>Small-scale turbulence limit of Fokker-Planck equation for polymers in turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular limit of Fokker-Planck equation of polymers density as the dominant time-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero. Here, we complete the study of Flandoli-Tahraoui[arXiv:2410.00520] about scaling limit as the space-scale of small scale component of turbulent flow goes to zero by using stochastic modeling of turbulence. Depending on certain parameters related to turbulence modeling, the limit density has generalized Cauchy distribution for the end-to-end vector. We discuss also the limit when we don't have a probability density limit. Our approach is based on the derivation of an appropriate estimates on $L^2$ with appropriate weight and investigate the convergence.</description>

Abstract: Due to the singular nonlinear Hall term, the non-resistive electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is not known to be locally well-posed in general. In this paper we consider the $2\frac12$D electron MHD with either horizontal or vertical resistivity and show local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Filtering of Stochastic Nonlinear Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will develop linear and nonlinear filtering methods for a large class of nonlinear wave equations that arise in applications such as quantum dynamics and laser generation and propagation in a unified framework. We consider both stochastic calculus and white noise filtering methods and derive measure-valued evolution equations for the nonlinear filter and prove existence and uniqueness theorems for the solutions. We will also study first order approximations to these measure-valued evolutions by linearizing the wave equations and characterize the filter dynamics in terms of infinite dimensional operator Riccati equations and establish solvability theorems.</description>

      <title>Riesz Transform Characterizations of $H^1$ and {\rm BMO} on Ahlfors Regular Sets with Small Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Riesz transform as a means for describing geometric properties of sets in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$, and study the extent to which they can be used to characterize function spaces defined on said sets. In particular, characterizations of the end-point spaces on the Lebesgue scale $L^p$ with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, namely the Hardy space $H^1$ and the John-Nirenberg space {\rm BMO}, are produced in terms of the Riesz transforms on Ahlfors regular sets in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ with small oscillations (quantified in terms of the {\rm BMO} nature of the outward unit normal). These generalize the celebrated results of C.~Fefferman and E.~Stein in the flat Euclidean setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with mixed couplings of attractive and repulsive forces, which arise from the models in Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear optics. In particular, we build solutions whose first component has one bump and the other components have several peaks forming a regular polygon around the single bump of the first component.</description>

      <title>On Exponents of Thickness in Geometry Rigidity Inequality for Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exponents of thickness in Frieseck-James-M\"uller's inequalities for shells. We derive the following results: (a) the exponent of thickness $\mu(S)\leq15/8$ if the middle surface $S$ is parabolic; (b) the exponent of thickness $\mu(S)\leq11/6$ if the middle surface $S$ is a minimal surface with negative curvature; (c) the exponent of thickness $\mu(S)\leq11/6$ if the middle surface $S$ is a ruled surface with negative curvature. The exponents of thickness in Frieseck-James-M\"uller's inequalities for thin shells represent the relationship between rigidity and thickness $h$ of a shell when the large deformations take place, i. e., the rigidity of the shell related to the thickness $h$ is $$Ch^{\mu(S)}.$$ Thus the above results of $\mu(S)&lt;2$ show that those shells are strictly more rigid than plates since $\mu(S)=2$ for plates. Moreover, we present another result which shows that when $\mu(S)&lt;2,$ any $W^{2,2}$ isometry of the middle surface is rigid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study mild solutions for the forced, incompressible fractional Navier-Stokes equations. These solutions are classically obtained via a fixed-point argument which relies on suitable estimates for the initial data, the nonlinearity and the external forces. Many functional spaces can be considered, however we are mainly interested here in a critical setting which ensures the existence of global solutions. We give some examples of such critical functional spaces and we discuss their relationship with generic external forces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation of a multidomain model for the electric potential in bundles of randomly distributed axons with different radii. The FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics is assumed on the axons' membrane, and the conductivity depends nonlinearly on the electric field. Under ergodicity conditions, we study the asymptotic behavior of the potential in the bundle when the number of the axons in the bundle is sufficiently large and derive a macroscopic multidomain model describing the electrical activity of the bundle. Due to the randomness of geometry, the effective intracellular potential is not deterministic but is shown to be a stationary function with realizations that are constant on axons' cross sections. The technique combines the stochastic two-scale convergence and the method of monotone operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of the classical Chernoff's theorem to construct explicit solutions for the heat and Schr\"odinger equations on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^d$. Using semigroup approximation techniques, we obtain analytically tractable and numerically implementable representations of fundamental solutions. In particular, we establish a new connection between the heat equation and Brownian motion on $\mathbb{H}^d$ and provide a rigorous realization of the Feynman path integral for the Schr\"odinger equation. The study highlights the challenges posed by the noncommutative structure of the Heisenberg group and opens new directions for PDEs on sub-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Recovering a (1+1)-dimensional wave equation from a single white noise boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following inverse problem: Suppose a $(1+1)$-dimensional wave equation on $\mathbb R_+$ with zero initial conditions is excited with a Neumann boundary data modelled as a white noise process. Given also the Dirichlet data at the same point, determine the unknown first order coefficient function of the system.
  We first establish that direct problem is well-posed. The inverse problem is then solved by showing that correlations of the boundary data determine the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator in the sense of distributions, which is known to uniquely identify the coefficient. This approach has applications in acoustic measurements of internal cross-sections of fluid pipes such as pressurised water supply pipes and vocal tract shape determination.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and convergence of higher-order Hartree equations in critical Sobolev spaces on $\mathbb{T}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Hartree equations generalised to $2p+1$ order nonlinearities. These equations arise in the study of the mean-field limits of Bose gases with $p$-body interactions. We study their well-posedness properties in $H^{s_c}(\mathbb{T}^3)$, where $\mathbb{T}^3$ is the three dimensional torus and $s_c = 3/2 - 1/p$ is the scaling-critical regularity. The convergence of solutions of the Hartree equation to solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is proved. We also consider the case of mixed nonlinearities, proving local well-posedness in $s_c$ by considering the problem as a perturbation of the higher-order Hartree equation. In the particular case of the (defocusing) quintic-cubic Hartree equation, we also prove global well-posedness for all initial conditions in $H^1(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This is done by viewing it as a perturbation of the local quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Solution Theory of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in Spectral Barron Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the solution theory of the whole-space static (elliptic) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in spectral Barron spaces. We prove that under the assumption that the coefficients involved are spectral Barron functions and the discount factor is sufficiently large, there exists a sequence of uniformly bounded spectral Barron functions that converges locally uniformly to the solution. As a consequence, the solution of the HJB equation can be approximated by two-layer neural networks without curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite element approximation for quasi-static crack growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an adaptive finite element approximation for a model of quasi-static crack growth in dimension two. The discrete setting consists of integral functionals that are defined on continuous, piecewise affine functions, where the triangulation is a part of the unknown of the problem and adaptive in each minimization step. The limit passage is conducted simultaneously in the vanishing mesh size and discretized time step, and results in an evolution for the continuum Griffith model of brittle fracture with isotropic surface energy [FriedrichSolombrino16] which is characterized by an irreversibility condition, a global stability, and an energy balance. Our result corresponds to an evolutionary counterpart of the static Gamma-convergence result in [BabadjianBonhomme23] for which, as a byproduct, we provide an alternative proof.</description>

      <title>Global small data weak solutions of 2-D semilinear wave equations with scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an interesting open question: for the $n$-D ($n\ge 1$) semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $t\ge 1$, $p&gt;1$, $\mu\in (0, \bar\mu(n))$ with $\bar\mu(n)=\frac{n^2+n+2}{n+2}$, the global small data weak solution $u$ will exist when $p&gt;p_{s}(n+\mu) =\frac{n+\mu+1+\sqrt{(n+\mu)^2+10(n+\mu)-7}}{2(n+\mu-1)}$. In the case of $n=1$, this open question has been solved well. We now systematically study this problem for $n=2$ and $\mu\in (0, 1)\cup (1, \bar\mu(2))$ with $\bar\mu(2)=2$. In the present paper, the global small solution $u$ is established for $p_{s}(2+\mu)&lt;p&lt;p_{conf}(2,\mu)=\frac{\mu+5}{\mu+1}$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. Our main ingredients are to derive some new kinds of spacetime-weighted $L^{q}_tL^{q}_x([1, \infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2)$ or $L^q_tL^\nu_rL^2_{\theta}([1, \infty)\times [0, \infty)\times [0, 2\pi])$ Strichartz estimates for the solutions of linear generalized Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2v-t^m\Delta v=F(t,x)$ ($m&gt;0$). In forthcoming paper, we show the global existence of small solution $u$ for $p\ge p_{conf}(2,\mu)$ and $\mu\in (0,1)\cup (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Fractional elliptic reaction-diffusion systems with coupled gradient terms and different diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the existence and nonexistence of nonnegative solutions to a class of nonlocal elliptic systems set in a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The diffusion operators are of type $u_i\mapsto d_i(-\Delta)^{s_i}u_i$ where $0&lt;s_1\neq s_2&lt;1$, and the gradients of the unknowns act as source terms. Existence results are obtained by proving some fine estimates when data belong to weighted Lebesgue spaces. Those estimates are new and interesting in themselves.</description>

      <title>On a mixed problem for the nonstationary Stokes system in an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autor considers an initial-boundary value problem for the nonstationary Stokes system in an angle, where Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are prescribed on the diferent sides of the angle. The major part of the paper deals with the parameter-depending problem which arises after the application of the Laplace transform. The author obtains existence, uniqueness and regularity results for this problem in a class of weighted Sobolev spaces. Using the properties of the Laplace transform, he proves the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of the time-dependent problem.</description>

      <title>The structure of fully nonlinear equations and its applications to prescribed problems on complete conformal metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of fully nonlinear equations and their applications to geometric problems. We solve some fully nonlinear version of the Loewner-Nirenberg and Yamabe problems. Notably, we introduce Morse theory techniques to construct admissible metrics under a weak condition on the underlying metric, which can be further relaxed in a broad setting. Furthermore, we provide some topological obstruction to demonstrate the optimality of our structural conditions.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the Helmholtz problem with general wavenumbers on the $n$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Helmholtz problem in the exterior of a ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and radiation conditions imposed at infinity. The differential Helmholtz operator depends on the complex wavenumber with non-negative real part and is formulated for general spatial dimension. We prove wavenumber explicit continuity estimates of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator which are valid for all wavenumbers under consideration and do not deteriorate as they tend to zero.
  The exterior Helmholtz problem can be equivalently reformulated on a bounded domain with DtN boundary conditions on the artificial boundary of a ball. We derive wavenumber independent trace and Friedrichs-type inequalities for the solution space in wavenumber-indexed norms.</description>

      <title>On the singular limit of Brinkman's law to Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study singular limits of congestion-averse growth models, connecting different models describing the effect of congestion. These models arise in particular in the context of tissue growth. The main ingredient of our analysis is a family of energy evolution equations and their dissipation structures, which are novel and of independent interest. This strategy allows us to consider a larger family of pressure laws as well as proving the joint limit, from a compressible Brinkman's model to the incompressible Darcy's law, where the latter is a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Regularity of vectorial minimizers for non-uniformly elliptic anisotropic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local boundedness of the local minimizers $u:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ of non-uniformly elliptic integrals of the form $\int_{\Omega}f(x,Dv)\,dx$, where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq2)$ and the integrand satisfies anisotropic growth conditions of the type \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}(x)|\xi_{i}|^{p_{i}}\le f(x,\xi)\le\mu(x)\left\{ 1+|\xi|^{q}\right\} \] for some exponents $q\geq p_{i}&gt;1$ and with non-negative functions $\lambda_{i},\mu$ fulfilling suitable summability assumptions. The main novelties here are the degenerate and anisotropic behaviour of the integrand and the fact that we also address the case of vectorial minimizers ($m&gt;1$). Our proof is based on the celebrated Moser iteration technique and employs an embedding result for anisotropic Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns elliptic systems of $p$-Laplace type with complex valued coefficient and source term. We extend the real valued theory of the elliptic $p$-Laplace equation to the complex valued case. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet problem and prove the Schauder estimate in the case of H\"older continuous coefficients and source terms. We also consider families of coefficient functions parametrized by a complex variable and prove a differentiability result for the map taking the complex parameter to the corresponding solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show non-uniqueness of local strong solutions to stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations with linear multiplicative noise and some certain deterministic force. Such non-uniqueness holds true even if we perturb such deterministic force in appropriate sense.This is closely related to a critical condition on force under which Leray-Hopf solution to the stochastic equations is locally unique. Meanwhile, by a new idea, we show that for some stochastic force the system admits two different global Leray-Hopf solutions smooth on any compact subset of $(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the quantization problem on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of quantization of measures looks for best approximations of probability measures on a metric space by discrete measures supported on $N$ points, where the error of approximation is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Zador's theorem states that, for measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds satisfying appropriate integrability conditions, the quantization error decays to zero as $N \to \infty$ at the rate $N^{-1/d}$.
  In this paper, we provide a general treatment of the asymptotics of quantization on metric measure spaces $(X, \nu)$. We show that a weaker version of Zador's theorem involving the Hausdorff densities of $\nu$ holds also in this general setting. We also prove Zador's theorem in full for appropriate $m$-rectifiable measures on Euclidean space, answering a conjecture by Graf and Luschgy in the affirmative. For both results, the higher integrability conditions of Zador's theorem are replaced with a general notion of $(p,s)$-quantizability, which follows from Pierce-type (non-asymptotic) upper bounds on the quantization error, and we also prove multiple such bounds at the level of metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called the Graph Geometric Control Condition (GGCC). It turns out to be a simple, geometric rewriting of many of the frameworks in which the controllability of PDEs on graphs has been studied. We prove that (GGCC) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact controllability of the wave equation on metric graphs with internal controls and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We then investigate the internal exact controllability of the wave equation with mixed boundary conditions and the one of the Schr\"odinger equation, as well as the internal null-controllability of the heat equation. We show that (GGCC) provides a sufficient condition for the controllability of these equations and we provide explicit examples proving that (GGCC) is not necessary in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates rate-independent systems (RIS), where the dissipation functional depends not only on the rate but also on the history of the state. The latter is expressed in terms of an integral operator. We establish an existence result for the original problem and for the control thereof, without resorting to smallness assumptions. Under a smoothness condition, we prove the uniqueness of solutions to a certain class of history-dependent RIS where the subdifferential of the dissipation potential is an unbounded operator. In this context, we derive an essential estimate that opens the door to future research on the topic of optimization.</description>

      <title>On logarithmic double phase problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new logarithmic double phase type operator of the form\begin{align*}\mathcal{G}u:=-\operatorname{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{p(x)-2}\nabla u+\mu(x)\left[\log(e+|\nabla u|)+\frac{|\nabla u|}{q(x)(e+|\nabla u|)}\right]|\nabla u|^{q(x)-2} \nabla u \right),\end{align*}where $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $p,q\in C(\overline{\Omega})$ with $1&lt;p(x)\leq q(x)$ for all $x\in\overline{\Omega}$ and $0\leq\mu(\cdot)\in L^1(\Omega)$. First, we prove that the logarithmic Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces $W^{1,\mathcal{H}_{\log}}(\Omega)$ and $W^{1, \mathcal{H}_{\log}}_0(\Omega)$ with $\mathcal{H}_{\log}(x,t)=t^{p(x)}+\mu(x)t^{q(x)}\log(e+t)$ for $(x,t)\in \overline{\Omega}\times [0,\infty)$ are separable, reflexive Banach spaces and $W^{1,\mathcal{H}_{\log}}_0(\Omega)$ can be equipped with an equivalent norm. We also prove several embedding results for these spaces and the closedness of these spaces under truncations. In addition we show the density of smooth functions in $W^{1,\mathcal{H}_{\log}}(\Omega)$ even in the case of an unbounded domain by supposing Nekvinda's decay condition on $p(\cdot)$. The second part is devoted to the properties of the operator and it turns out that it is bounded, continuous, strictly monotone, of type (S$_+$), coercive and a homeomorphism. As a result of independent interest we also present a new version of Young's inequality for the product of a power-law and a logarithm. In the last part of this work we consider equations driven by our new operator with superlinear right-hand sides. We prove multiplicity results for this type of equation, in particular about sign-changing solutions, by making use of a suitable variation of the corresponding Nehari manifold together with the quantitative deformation lemma and the Poincar\'e-Miranda existence theorem.</description>

      <title>De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for kinetic equations with nonlocal diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the celebrated De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory to a class of nonlocal hypoelliptic equations naturally arising in kinetic theory, which combine a first-order operator with an elliptic one involving fractional derivatives along only part of the coordinates. Provided that the nonlocal tail in velocity of weak solutions is just $p$-summable along the drift variables, we prove the first local $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimate for kinetic integral equations. Then, we establish the first strong Harnack inequality under the aforementioned tail summability assumption. The latter is in fact naturally implied in literature, e. g., from the usual mass density boundedness (as for the Boltzmann equation without cut-off), and it reveals to be in clear accordance with the very recent counterexample by Kassmann and Weidner \cite{KW24c}. Armed with the aforementioned results, we are able to provide a geometric characterization of the Harnack inequality in the same spirit of the seminal paper by Aronson and Serrin \cite{AS67} for the (local) parabolic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Global Existence For A Nonlocal Multi-Species Aggregation-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of global existence of smooth solutions to a multi-species aggregation-diffusion equation for a class of singular interaction kernels. We establish a smallness condition on the initial data which yields global existence of smooth solutions. We also give conditions on the species interaction which ensure that pointwise inequalities comparing species densities are preserved by the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a plasma that is created by a high voltage difference $\lambda$, which is known as a Townsend discharge. We consider it to be confined to the region $\Omega$ between two concentric spheres, two concentric cylinders, or more generally between two star-shaped surfaces. We first prove that if the plasma is initially relatively dilute, then either it may remain dilute for all time or it may not, depending on a certain parameter $\kappa(\lambda, \Omega)$. Secondly, we prove that there is a connected one-parameter family of steady states. This family connects the non-ionized gas to a plasma, either with a sparking voltage $\lambda^*$ or with very high ionization, at least in the cylindrical or spherical cases.</description>

      <title>Improvement of flatness for nonlocal free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study for the first time the regularity of the free boundary in the one-phase free boundary problem driven by a general nonlocal operator. Our main results establish that the free boundary is $C^{1,\alpha}$ near regular points, and that the set of regular free boundary points is open and dense. Moreover, in 2D we classify all blow-up limits and prove that the free boundary is $C^{1,\alpha}$ everywhere. The main technical tool of our proof is an improvement of flatness scheme, which we establish in the general framework of viscosity solutions, and which is of independent interest. All of these results were only known for the fractional Laplacian, and are completely new for general nonlocal operators. In contrast to previous works on the fractional Laplacian, our method of proof is purely nonlocal in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cahn-Hilliard equation with non-degenerate concentration-dependent mobility and logarithmic potential in two dimensions. We show that any weak solution is unique, exhibits propagation of uniform-in-time regularity, and stabilizes towards an equilibrium state of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for large times. These results improve the state of the art dating back to a work by Barrett and Blowey. Our analysis relies on the combination of enhanced energy estimates, elliptic regularity theory and tools in critical Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Weak* Solutions III: A Convergent Front Tracking Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified Front Tracking (mFT) scheme for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension, in which we allow arbitrarily large nonlinear waves. We build the scheme by introducing and solving a ``generalized Riemann Problem'', which yields exact solutions for finite times. This allows us to treat the states adjacent to all waves exactly, and approximate compressive simple waves in addition to rarefactions, contacts and shocks. In particular, we require exact expression of the various wave curves and avoid the use of Taylor expansions. After construction of the scheme, under reasonable assumptions, we show that the mFT approximations converge to a weak* solution of the system. This essentially reduces existence of solutions with large amplitude data to obtaining uniform bounds on the total variation of the approximations.
  We then apply the scheme to the Euler equations of gas dynamics, for which we exactly solve the generalized Riemann Problem and define the scheme for both 3x3 and 2x2 systems, and prove the equivalence of Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. For the $p$-system, modeling isentropic gas dynamics in a Lagrangian frame, we show that there is no finite accumulation of interaction times. This means that the last remaining obstacle to global existence of large data, large amplitude solutions is the construction of a decreasing Glimm potential.</description>

      <title>Long time well-posedness for the 3D Prandtl boundary layer equations without structural assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with existence and uniqueness, and stability of the solution for the 3D Prandtl equation in a polynomial weighted Sobolev space. The main novelty of this paper is to directly prove the long time well-posedness to 3D Prandtl equation without any structural assumption by the energy method. Moreover, the solution's lifespan can be extended to any large $T$, provided that the initial data with a perturbation lies in the monotonic shear profile of small size $e^{-T}$. This result improves the work by Xu and Zhang (J. Differential Equations, 263(12)(2017), 8749-8803) on the 2D Prandtl equations, achieving an extension to the three-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Stability of Poiseuille Flow of Navier-Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ close to the Poiseuille flow with viscosity $0&lt; \nu &lt; 1$. For the linearized problem, we prove that when the $x$-frequency satisfy $|k| \ge \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the perturbation decays on a time-scale proportional to $\nu^{-\frac{1}{2}}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Since it decays faster than the heat equation, this phenomenon is referred to as enhanced dissipation. Then we concern the non-linear equations. We show that if the initial perturbation $\omega_{in}$ is at most of size $\nu^\frac{7}{3}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space, then the size of the perturbation remains no more than twice the size of its initial value.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Tensorization of Kinetic Theory and Graph Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong form of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the initial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic limit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any realization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling distance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an interpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional overlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate of the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph homomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field theory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable systems.</description>

      <title>On a 1d nonlocal transport of the incompressible porous media equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kiselev and Sarsam proposed the following nonlocal transport equation as a one-dimensional analogue of the 2D incompressible porous media (IPM) equation \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+u\partial_x\rho= 0,~u=gH_a\rho, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $H_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} H_af(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{a^2f(y)}{(x-y)((x-y)^2+a^2)}dy. \end{eqnarray*} In the preprint [Kiselev-Sarsam, arXiv:2412.16376], the authors proved the local well-posedness for this 1D periodic IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of smooth initial data. In this paper, we present several new weighted integral inequalities for the transform $H_a$ in the setting of the real line. Based on these integral inequalities, we also prove the finite time blow-up for this 1D IPM model on the real line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1612.08052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generalizations of Reifenberg's Theorem for measures in $\mathbb R^n$ under assumptions on the Jones' $\beta$-numbers, which appropriately measure how close the support is to being contained in a subspace. Our main results, which holds for general measures without density assumptions, give effective measure bounds on $\mu$ away from a closed $k$-rectifiable set with bounded Hausdorff measure. We show examples to see the sharpness of our results. Under further density assumptions one can translate this into a global measure bound and $k$-rectifiable structure for $\mu$. Applications include quantitative Reifenberg theorems on sets and discrete measures, as well as upper Ahlfor's regularity estimates on measures which satisfy $\beta$-number estimates on all scales.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a two dimensional pseudoconvex domain of finite type with a K\"ahler-Einstein Bergman metric is biholomorphic to the unit ball. This answers an old question of Yau for such domains. The proof relies on asymptotics of derivatives of the Bergman kernel along critically tangent paths approaching the boundary, where the order of tangency equals the type of the boundary point being approached.</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. An effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods is presented. The calculated matrices are small matrices; and this allows to use effectively JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which allows to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. The complexity of developing an implementation based on the proposed approach does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation. Performance analysis using roofline partly explains the observed features of the decreasing of computational costs.</description>

      <title>A uniform rate of convergence for the entropic potentials in the quadratic Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bound the rate of uniform convergence in compact sets for both entropic potentials and their gradients towards the Brenier potential and its gradient, respectively. Both results hold in the quadratic Euclidean setting for absolutely continuous measures satisfying some convexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Uniqueness of the Integral Invariant in A Characteristic-type Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characteristic Galerkin-type semi-Lagrangian discontinuous finite element scheme (CSLDG) is investigated, which directly discretizes an integral invariant model derived from the coupling of a transport equation and its dual equation. Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques. The stability of the integral invariant weak solution is subsequently demonstrated by the strategic selection of the test function Psi, leading to the proof of its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>An isopermetric inequality for lower order Neumann eigenvalues in Gauss space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp isoperimetric inequality for the harmonic mean of the first $m-1$ nonzero Neumann eigenvalues for bounded Lipschitz domains symmetric about the origin in Gauss space. Our result generalizes the Szeg\"o-Weinberger type inequality in Gauss space, as proved in [8, Theorem 4.1].</description>

Abstract: We prove lower bounds for the first non-trivial eigenvalue of the drift Laplacian on manifolds with Wentzell-type boundary condition in terms of some Cheeger-type constants for bulk-boundary interactions. Our results are in the spirit of Cheeger's classical inequality.</description>
