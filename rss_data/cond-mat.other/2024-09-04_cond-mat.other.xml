      <title>Massive Dirac particles based on gapped graphene with Rosen-Morse potential in a uniform magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the gapped graphene structure in the two-dimensional plane in the presence of the Rosen-Morse potential and an external uniform magnetic field. In order to describe the corresponding structure, we consider the propagation of electrons in graphene as relativistic fermion quasi-particles, and analyze it by the wave functions of two-component spinors with pseudo-spin symmetry using the Dirac equation. Next, to solve and analyze the Dirac equation, we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the Legendre differential equation. After that, we obtain the bounded states of energy depending on the coefficients of Rosen-Morse and magnetic potentials in terms of quantum numbers of principal \(n\) and spin-orbit \(k\). Then, the values of the energy spectrum for the ground state and the first excited state are calculated, and the wave functions and the corresponding probabilities are plotted in terms of coordinates $r$. In what follows, we explore the band structure of gapped graphene by the modified dispersion relation and write it in terms of the two-dimensional wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$. Finally, the energy bands are plotted in terms of the wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$ with and without the magnetic term.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced dynamical formation of Floquet-Bloch bands in Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments, combing ultrafast strong-field irradiation of surfaces with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, allow for monitoring the time-dependent charge carrier dynamics and the build-up of transient sidebands due to the radiation pulses. While these structures are reminiscent of Floquet-Bloch bands, standard Floquet theory is not applicable since it requires a strictly time-periodic driving field. To study the emergence and formation of such sidebands, i.e. to provide a link between common Floquet physics and dynamical mechanisms underlying short driving pulses, we consider a generalization of Floquet theory, the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism. This approach naturally extents Floquet theory to driving field amplitudes with a superimposed envelope shape. Motivated by experiments we study 2D Dirac Hamiltonians subject to linearly and circularly polarised light waves with a Gaussian field envelope of a few cycles. For these Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonians we study the evolution of their Floquet-Bloch spectra, accompanied by a systematic analysis of the time-dependent (sideband) transitions. We show that sideband occupation requires circularly polarized light for linear Dirac systems such as graphene, while for Dirac models with trigonal warping, describing surface states of topological insulators such as Bi$_2$ Se$_3$, both linearly and circularly polarised pulses induce sideband excitations.</description>

      <title>Characterization and optimization of high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the photoconversion efficiency $\eta$ of the silicon-based solar cells (SCs) under laboratory conditions is approaching the theoretical fundamental limit, further improvement of their performance requires theoretical modeling and/or numerical simulation to optimize the SCs parameters and design. The existing numerical approaches to modeling and optimization of the key parameters of high-efficiency solar cells based on monocrystalline silicon (c-Si), the dominant material in photovoltaics, are described. It is shown that, in addition to the four usually considered recombination processes, namely, Shockley-Read-Hall, surface, radiative, and band-to-band Auger recombination mechanisms, the non-radiative exciton Auger recombination and recombination in the space charge region (SCR) have to be included. To develop the analytical SC characterization formalism, we proposed a simple expression to model the wavelength-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photocurrent near the absorption edge. Based on this parameterization, the theory developed allows for calculating and optimizing the base thickness-dependent short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, and the SC photoconversion efficiency. We proved that the approach to optimize the solar cell parameters, especially its thickness and the base doping level, is accurate and demonstrated for the two Si solar cells reported in the literature, one with an efficiency of 26.7 % and the other with the record efficiency of 26.81 %. It is shown that the formalism developed allows further optimization of the solar cell thickness and doping level, thus increasing the SC efficiency to an even higher value.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effect in an ultracold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. One example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas like curved space, high-order topological phases, and black holes, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here, we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin-orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with non-zero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Further, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the center of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points (EPs) are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated EPs emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non-Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of surface-selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non-Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, surface-projected density functional theory calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc connectivity and generates new isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the surface-selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk--non-Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non-Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non-Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced phase transition in the central spin model: second R\'enyi entropy in dual space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical investigation of the dynamics of the central spin model in the presence of measurement processes. This model holds promise for experimental exploration due to its topology, which facilitates the natural distinction of a central particle and the quantum bath as different subsystems, allowing for the examination of entanglement phase transitions. To characterize the measurement-induced phase transition in this system, we employ a recently developed method based on second R\'enyi entropy in dual space. Our simulations account for decoherence, energy relaxation, and gate errors. We determine critical measurement rates and demonstrate that they significantly differ from those predicted by a simple approach based on mutual entropy.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>
