      <title>On the Order Between the Standard Deviation and Gini Mean Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the order between the standard deviation (SD) and the Gini mean difference (GMD) and derive sharp, interpretable sufficient conditions under which one exceeds the other. By expressing both the SD and the GMD in terms of pairwise differences and linking their comparison to the mean excess function of the absolute difference of two i.i.d.\ copies, we reduce the problem to structural properties of the underlying distribution. Using tools from reliability and survival analysis, we show that SD dominance arises under heavy-tailed regimes, characterized by decreasing hazard rates or increasing reverse hazard rates. Conversely, when both tails are light -- equivalently, when the hazard rate is increasing and the reverse hazard rate is decreasing -- the GMD dominates the SD.
  We further demonstrate that these dominance relations are preserved under affine transformations, mixtures, convolutions, and tail truncation, and we extend the analysis to discrete distributions. Numerous examples illustrate the sharpness of the results and highlight the distinct roles played by tail behavior and distributional regularity. Our findings provide a unified framework for understanding dispersion ordering and offer clear guidance for the choice of variability measures in risk-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Integrated Representation Learning for Crypto Anomaly Detection under Extreme Label Scarcity; Relational Domain-Logic Integration with Retrieval-Grounded Context and Path-Level Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous trajectories in decentralized crypto networks is fundamentally challenged by extreme label scarcity and the adaptive evasion strategies of illicit actors. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</description>

      <title>Spectral Dynamics and Regularization for High-Dimensional Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model for time-varying, asymmetric, tail-dependent copulas in high dimensions that incorporates both spectral dynamics and regularization. The dynamics of the dependence matrix' eigenvalues are modeled in a score-driven way, while biases in the unconditional eigenvalue spectrum are resolved by non-linear shrinkage. The dynamic parameterization of the copula dependence matrix ensures that it satisfies the appropriate restrictions at all times and for any dimension. The model is parsimonious, computationally efficient, easily scalable to high dimensions, and performs well for both simulated and empirical data. In an empirical application to financial market dynamics using 100 stocks from 10 different countries and 10 different industry sectors, we find that our copula model captures both geographic and industry related co-movements and outperforms recent computationally more intensive clustering-based factor copula alternatives. Both the spectral dynamics and the regularization contribute to the new model's performance. During periods of market stress, we find that the spectral dynamics reveal strong increases in international stock market dependence, which causes reductions in diversification potential and increases in systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk measures with markets volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.06185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systemic risk measures (SRMs) are crucial for the stability of financial markets, yet classical formulations fail to capture the complexity of market volatility. We propose a new framework for systemic risk measurement on the variable-exponent Bochner-Lebesgue space (VEBLS) $L^{p(\cdot)}$, where the exponent $p(\cdot)$ is modeled as a random variable, thereby incorporating latent volatility effects. By introducing appropriate deterministic functions (DFs) and single-firm risk measures (SFRMs), we decompose systemic risk assessment in $L^{p(\cdot)}$ into two sequential components and establish corresponding dual representations. Several examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
