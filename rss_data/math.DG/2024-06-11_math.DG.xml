      <title>A Geometric Application of Soliton Surfaces associated with the Betchov-Da Rios Equation using an Extended Darboux Frame Field in $E^{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a soliton surface $\Omega=\Omega(u,v)$ associated with the Betchov-Da Rios equation, we obtain the derivative formulas of an extended Darboux frame field of a unit speed curve $u$-parameter curve $\Omega=\Omega(u,v)$ for all $v$. Also, we get the geometric invariants $k$ and $h$ of the soliton surface $\Omega=\Omega(u,v)$ and we obtain the Gaussian curvature, mean curvature vector and Gaussian torsion of $\Omega$. We give some important geometric characterizations such as flatness, minimality and semi-umbilicaly with the aid of these invariants. Additionally, we study the curvature ellipse of the Betchov-Da Rios soliton surface and Wintgen ideal (superconformal) Betchov-Da Rios soliton surface with respect to an extended Darboux frame field. Finally, we construct an application for the Betchov-Da Rios soliton surface with the aid of an extended Darboux frame field.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving nonhomogeneous Gauss curvature flow in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the volume preserving flow of smooth, closed and convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ with speed given by a general nonhomogeneous function of the Gauss curvature. For a large class of speed functions, we prove that the solution of the flow remains convex, exists for all positive time $t\in [0,\infty)$ and converges to a geodesic sphere exponentially as $t\to\infty$ in the smooth topology. A key step is to show the $L^1$ oscillation decay of the Gauss curvature to its average along a subsequence of times going to the infinity, which combined with an argument using the hyperbolic curvature measure theory implies the Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Atiyah classes of Lie algebroid homotopy modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Lie algebroid pair $A\hookrightarrow L$ we study cocycles constructed from the extension to $L$ of the higher connection forms of a representation up to homotopy $E$ of the Lie algebroid $A$. We show that there exists a cohomology class with values in the endomorphism bundle of $E$ that is independent of the extension above and vanishes whenever a homotopy $A$-compatible extension exists. Whenever the representation up to homotopy $E$ is the resolution of a Lie algebroid representation $K$ of $A$, it is shown that there exists a quasi-isomorphism sending the new Atiyah class to the classical one, associated to extensions to $L$ of the Lie algebroid representation $K$.</description>

      <title>On Differential and Riemannian Calculus on Wasserstein Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an intrinsic formalism to study the topology, smooth structure, and Riemannian geometry of the Wasserstein space of a closed Riemannian manifold. Our formalism allows for a new characterisation of the Weak topology via convergent sequences of the subjacent space. Applying it we also provide a new proof that Wasserstein spaces of closed manifolds are geodesically convex. Our framework is particularly handy to address the Wasserstein spaces of compact Lie groups, where we refine our formalism and present an explicit example.</description>

      <title>A Discrete Exterior Calculus of Bundle-valued Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discretization of Cartan's exterior calculus of differential forms has been fruitful in a variety of theoretical and practical endeavors: from computational electromagnetics to the development of Finite-Element Exterior Calculus, the development of structure-preserving numerical tools satisfying exact discrete equivalents to Stokes' theorem or the de Rham complex for the exterior derivative have found numerous applications in computational physics. However, there has been a dearth of effort in establishing a more general discrete calculus, this time for differential forms with values in vector bundles over a combinatorial manifold equipped with a connection. In this work, we propose a discretization of the exterior covariant derivative of bundle-valued differential forms. We demonstrate that our discrete operator mimics its continuous counterpart, satisfies the Bianchi identities on simplicial cells, and contrary to previous attempts at its discretization, ensures numerical convergence to its exact evaluation with mesh refinement under mild assumptions.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of parabolic geometries near isolated higher-order fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Cartan geometries admitting automorphisms with isotropies satisfying a particular, loosely dynamical property on their model geometries, we demonstrate the existence of an open subset of the geometry with trivial holonomy. This property, which generalizes characteristics of isotropies corresponding to isolated higher-order fixed points in parabolic geometries that are known to require a nearby open subset to have vanishing curvature, only relies upon the behavior of the isotropy in the model geometry, and therefore applies regardless of initial curvature assumptions, such as regularity or normality. Along the way to proving our main results, we also derive a couple of results for working with holonomy, relating to limits of sequences of developments and the existence of antidevelopments, that are useful in their own right. To showcase the effectiveness of the techniques developed, we use them to completely characterize all almost c-projective and almost quaternionic structures that admit a nontrivial automorphism with a higher-order fixed point, as well as all nondegenerate partially integrable almost CR structures that admit a higher-order fixed point with non-null isotropy.</description>

      <title>Gauss curvature flow to the $L_p$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Huang and Qin \cite{HY01} introduced Gaussian chord measure and $L_p$-Gaussian chord measure by variational methods. Meanwhile, they posed Gaussian chord Minkowski problem and used variational methods to obtain an origin-symmetric normalized measure solution for the Gaussian chord Minkowski problem.
  Motivated by the forgoing works of $L_p$-Gaussian chord measure, we can not only propose the $L_p$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem, but also obtain its smooth solutions. Specially, we provide a smooth even solution for $p=0$. In this paper, we obtain the existence of smooth even solutions to the $L_p$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem with $p\geq 0$ and $q&gt;2$ by method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>The Nodal Sets of Solutions to Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parabolic equations $\partial_t u=\partial_j\left(a^{ij}(x,t)\partial_iu\right)+b^j(x,t)\partial_ju+c(x,t)u$ in a domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the condition that $a^{ij}$ are Lipschitz continuous. Consider the nodal set $Z_t=\{x: u(x,t)=0\}$ at a time $t$-slice. Simple examples show that the singular set $\mathcal{S}_t=\{x: u(x,t)=|\nabla_x u|(x,t)=0\}$ may coincide with nodal set. This makes the methods used in the study of nodal sets for elliptic equations fail, rendering the parabolic case much more complicated.
  The current strongest results in the literature establish the finiteness of the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $Z_t$, assuming either $n=1$ by Angenent or that the coefficients are time-independent and analytic by Lin. With general coefficients, the codimension-one estimate was obtained under some doubling assumption by Han-Lin but only for space-time nodal sets. In the first part, we prove that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(Z_t) &lt; \infty$ in full generality, i.e. for any dimension, with time-dependent coefficients and with merely Lipschitz regular leading coefficients $a^{ij}$.
  In the second part, we study the evolutionary behavior of nodal sets. When $n=1$, it is proved by Angenent that the number of nodal points is non-increasing in time. For the $n$-dimensional case, we construct examples showing that measure monotonicity fails. In contrast, we prove dimension monotonicity, i.e., the Hausdorff dimension of the nodal set is non-increasing in time. This is the first monotonicity property for nodal sets in general dimensions. All the assumptions here are sharp.</description>

      <title>Deformations of swallowtails in a 3-dimensional space form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the authors' earlier work on deformations of cuspidal edges. We give a representation formula for swallowtails in the Euclidean 3-space. Using this, we investigate map germs of generic swallowtails in 3-dimensional space from, and show some important properties of them. In particular, we give a representation formula giving all map germs of swallowtails in the Euclidean 3-space whose Gaussian curvatures are bounded from below by a positive constant or by a negative constant from above. Using this, we show that any swallowtails are deformed into a swallowtail of constant Gaussian curvature preserving the sign of their Gaussian curvatures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that symmetries, which are known in the theory of integrable systems, naturally appeared in the classical linear theory of deformations of thin shells. Our result shows that if the middle surface of a shell becomes `integrable', infinitely many deformations exist that have no shear strains and twisting of the coordinate lines.</description>

      <title>A Twisted Adiabatic Limit Approach to Vanishing Theorems for Complex Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n$-dimensional compact complex Hermitian manifold $X$, a $C^\infty$ complex line bundle $L$ equipped with a connection $D$ whose $(0,\,1)$-component $D''$ squares to zero and a real-valued function $\eta$ on $X$, we prove that the $D''$-cohomology group of $L$ of any bidegree $(p,\,q)$ such that either $(p&gt;q \hspace{1ex}\mbox{and}\hspace{1ex} p+q\geq n+1)$ or $(p&lt;q \hspace{1ex}\mbox{and}\hspace{1ex} p+q\leq n-1)$ vanishes when two extra hypotheses are made. The first hypothesis requires a certain real-valued, not necessarily closed, $(1,\,1)$-form depending on $p,\,q$, on the curvature of $D$ and on a $(1,\,1)$-form induced by $\eta$ to be positive definite. The second hypothesis requires the norm of $\partial\eta$ to be small relative to $|\eta|$. This theorem, for which we also give a number of variants, is proved by generalising our very recent twisted adiabatic limit construction for complex structures to connections on complex line bundles. This twisting of $D$ induces first-order differential operators acting on the $L$-valued forms, for which we obtain commutation relations involving their formal adjoints, and two twisted Laplacians for which we obtain a comparison formula reminiscent of the classical Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano identity. The main features of our results are that $X$ need not be K\"ahler, $L$ need not be holomorphic and the types of $C^\infty$ functions that $X$ supports play a key role in our hypotheses, thus capturing some of their links with the geometry of manifolds.</description>

      <title>Metric Convolutions: A Unifying Theory to Adaptive Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard convolutions are prevalent in image processing and deep learning, but their fixed kernel design limits adaptability. Several deformation strategies of the reference kernel grid have been proposed. Yet, they lack a unified theoretical framework. By returning to a metric perspective for images, now seen as two-dimensional manifolds equipped with notions of local and geodesic distances, either symmetric (Riemannian metrics) or not (Finsler metrics), we provide a unifying principle: the kernel positions are samples of unit balls of implicit metrics. With this new perspective, we also propose metric convolutions, a novel approach that samples unit balls from explicit signal-dependent metrics, providing interpretable operators with geometric regularisation. This framework, compatible with gradient-based optimisation, can directly replace existing convolutions applied to either input images or deep features of neural networks. Metric convolutions typically require fewer parameters and provide better generalisation. Our approach shows competitive performance in standard denoising and classification tasks.</description>

Abstract: We provide proofs of two theorems stated by Massey in 1961, concerning the obstructions to finding complex structures on real vector bundles. In addition, we determine the second obstruction to a complex structure on a rank six orientable real vector bundle. The obstructions are fractional parts of integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, and a fourth of an appropriate combination of Pontryagin, Chern, and Euler classes.</description>

      <title>Singular extension of critical Sobolev mappings with values into complete Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triggered by a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [17], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by classical results by Benoist, we introduce and study natural objects associated to an integrable tangent vector to the character variety $\mathfrak X(\Gamma,\mathsf G)$ of a semi-group $\Gamma$, with values on a semi-simple real algebraic group $\mathsf G$ of the non-compact type. We obtain non-empty interior of the cone of Jordan variations and, when $\mathsf G$ is split and Benoist's limit cone is sparse, we obtain double-density results associated to these variations, giving in particular non-empty interior of the set of length-normalized variations. We then apply the developed techniques to study pressure forms on the space of Anosov representations, in particular to higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. Among other things we exhibit an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at the Fuchsian points of the Hitchin component. We finally exhibit a Diophantine equation that governs the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of higher-quasi-circles.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $p \colon M \to N$ is a normal Riemannian covering, with $N$ closed, and $M$ has exponential volume growth, then there are non-constant, positive harmonic functions on $M$. This was conjectured by Lyons and Sullivan in \cite{LS}.</description>

      <title>Null hypersurfaces as wave fronts in Lorentz-Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that ``$L$-complete null hypersurfaces'' (i.e. ruled hypersurfaces foliated by entirety of light-like lines) as wave fronts in the $(n+1)$-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space are canonically induced by hypersurfaces in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. As an application, we show that most of null wave fronts can be realized as restrictions of certain $L$-complete null wave fronts. Moreover, we determine $L$-complete null wave fronts whose singular sets are compact.</description>

      <title>Generalized K\"ahler manifolds via mapping tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the product of a $3$-torus and a compact K\"ahler (respectively, hyperK\"ahler) manifold we construct via mapping tori generalized K\"ahler manifolds of split (respectively, non-split) type. In this way we obtain new non-K\"ahler examples and we recover the known examples of generalized K\"ahler solvmanifolds. Moreover, we investigate the formality and the Dolbeault cohomology of the generalized K\"ahler mapping tori.</description>

      <title>On the geometry at infinity of manifolds with linear volume growth and nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, linear volume growth and noncollapsed ends always splits off a line at infinity. This completes the final step to prove the existence of isoperimetric sets given large volumes in the above setting. We also find that under our assumptions, the diameter of the level sets of any Busemann function are uniformly bounded as opposed to a classical result stating that they can have sublinear growth when ends are collapsing. Moreover, some equivalent characterizations of linear volume growth are given. Finally, we construct an example to show that for manifolds in our setting, although their limit spaces at infinity are always cylinders, the cross sections can be nonhomeomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an extension of Eells and Sampson's rigidity theorem for harmonic maps from a closed manifold of non-negative Ricci curvature to a manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. We give an application of our result in the setting of harmonic-Einstein (or Ricci-harmonic) metrics and as a consequence we recover a classical rigidity result of Hamilton for the problem of prescribed positive definite Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On weak inverse mean curvature flow and Minkowski-type inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a proper weak solution $\{ \Omega_{t} \}_{0 \leq t &lt; \infty}$ to inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3\leq n \leq 7$, is smooth and star-shaped by the time
  \begin{equation*}
  T= (n-1) \log \left( \frac{\text{sinh} \left( r_{+} \right)}{ \text{sinh} \left( r_{-} \right)} \right), \end{equation*} where $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$ are the geodesic out-radius and in-radius of the initial domain $\Omega_{0}$. The argument is inspired by the Alexandrov reflection method for extrinsic curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ due to Chow-Gulliver and uses a result of Li-Wei.
  As applications, we extend the Minkowski inequalities of Brendle-Hung-Wang and De Lima-Girao to outer-minimizing domains $\Omega_{0} \subset \mathbb{H}^{n}$ in these dimensions. From this, we also extend a Penrose-type inequality to balanced asymptotically hyperbolic graphs over the exteriors of outer-minimizing domains of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3 \leq n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent flows at infinity for finite-entropy shortening curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that an ancient smooth curve shortening flow with finite-entropy embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has a unique tangent flow at infinity. To this end, we show that its rescaled flows backwardly converge to a line with multiplity $m\geq 3$ exponentially fast in any compact region, unless the flow is a shrinking circle, a static line, a paper clip, or a translating grim reaper. In addition, we figure out the exact numbers of tips, vertices, and inflection points of the curves at negative enough time. Moreover, the exponential growth rate of graphical radius and the convergence of vertex regions to grim reaper curves will be shown.</description>

      <title>Bakry-\`Emery, Hardy, and Spectral Gap Estimates on Manifolds with Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectral properties and geometric functional inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $\ge3$ with (finite or countably many) conical singularities $\{z_i\}_{i\in\mathfrak I}$ in the neighborhood of which the largest lower bound for the Ricci curvature is \begin{equation}\label{d2} k(x)\simeq K_i-\frac{s_i}{d^2(z_i,x)}. \end{equation} Thus none of the existing Bakry-\'Emery inequalities or curvature-dimension conditions apply. In particular, $k$ does not belong to the Kato (or (extended Kato) class, and $(M,g)$ is not tamed. Manifolds with such a singular Ricci bound appear quite naturally., e.g. as cones over spheres of radius $&gt;1$
  For such manifolds with conical singularities we will prove
  * a version of the Bakry-\'Emery inequality
  * a novel Hardy inequality
  * a spectral gap estimate.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay estimates and smoothness of the moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.07026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dependence of standard gluing process for pseudoholomorphic curves under the change of the length $T$ of the neck-region with respect to the cylindrical metrics associated to the given analytic coordinates near the punctures in the setting of bordered open Riemann surface with boundary punctures. We establish exponential decay of the $T$-derivatives of the $T$-dependent family of glued solutions under the change of the length $T$ of the neck-region in a precise manner. This exponential decay estimate is an important ingredient to prove the smoothness of the Kuranishi structure constructed on the compactified moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves given in the appendix of the authors' book. We also demonstrate the way how this smoothness follows from the exponential decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify in terms of Hopf-type properties mapping tori of residually finite Poincar\'e Duality groups with non-zero Euler characteristic. This generalises and gives a new proof of the analogous classification for fibered 3-manifolds. Various applications are given. In particular, we deduce that rigidity results for Gromov hyperbolic groups hold for the above mapping tori with trivial center.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining differential operators from a line bundle to a vector bundle over the real projective space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify and construct $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ from a line bundle to a vector bundle over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{n-1}$ by the F-method. This generalizes a classical result of Bol for $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. Further, we classify the $K$-type formulas for the kernel $\text{Ker}(\mathcal{D})$ and image $\text{Im}(\mathcal{D})$ of $\mathcal{D}$. The standardness of the homomorphisms $\varphi$ corresponding to the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ between generalized Verma modules are also discussed.</description>
