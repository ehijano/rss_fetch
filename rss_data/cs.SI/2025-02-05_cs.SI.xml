      <title>Estimating Network Models using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are very flexible for modeling network formation but pose difficult estimation challenges due to their intractable normalizing constant. Existing methods, such as MCMC-MLE, rely on sequential simulation at every optimization step. We propose a neural network approach that trains on a single, large set of parameter-simulation pairs to learn the mapping from parameters to average network statistics. Once trained, this map can be inverted, yielding a fast and parallelizable estimation method. The procedure also accommodates extra network statistics to mitigate model misspecification. Some simple illustrative examples show that the method performs well in practice.</description>

      <title>Countering Election Sway: Strategic Algorithms in Friedkin-Johnsen Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social influence profoundly impacts individual choices and collective behaviors in politics. In this work, driven by the goal of protecting elections from improper influence, we consider the following scenario: an individual, who has vested interests in political party $Y$, is aware through reliable surveys that parties $X$ and $Y$ are likely to get 50.1\% and 49.9\% of the vote, respectively. Could this individual employ strategies to alter public opinions and consequently invert these polling numbers in favor of party $Y$?
  We address this question by employing: (i) the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, which is mathematically sophisticated and effectively captures the way individual biases and social interactions shape opinions, making it crucial for examining social influence, and (ii) interventions similar to those in Asch's experiments, which involve selecting a group of stooges within the network to spread a specific opinion. We mathematically formalize the aforementioned motivation as an optimization framework and establish that it is NP-hard and inapproximable within any constant factor. We introduce three efficient polynomial-time algorithms. The first two utilize a continuous approach: one employs gradient descent with Huber's estimator to approximate the median, and the other uses a sigmoid threshold influence function. The third utilizes a combinatorial greedy algorithm for targeted interventions. Through comparative analysis against various natural baselines and using real-world data, our results demonstrate that in numerous cases a small fraction of nodes chosen as stooges can significantly sway election outcomes under the Friedkin-Johnsen model.</description>

      <title>When not to target negative ties? Studying competitive influence maximisation in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence maximisation problem in networks with negative ties. Where prior work has focused on unsigned networks, we investigate the need to consider negative ties in networks while trying to maximise spread in a population - particularly under competitive conditions. Given a signed network we optimise the strategies of a focal controller, against competing influence in the network, using two approaches - either the focal controller uses a sign-agnostic approach or they factor in the sign of the edges while optimising their strategy. We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of population) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate negative ties in these settings. More specifically, we study the impact of: (a) network topology, (b) resource conditions and (c) competitor strategies on the difference in vote shares obtained across both methodologies. We observe that gains are maximum when resources available to the focal controller are low and the competitor avoids negative edges in their strategy. Conversely, gains are insignificant irrespective of resource conditions when the competitor targets the network indiscriminately. Finally, we study the problem in a game-theoretic setting, where we simultaneously optimise the strategies of both competitors. Interestingly we observe that, strategising with the knowledge of negative ties can occasionally also lead to loss in vote-shares.</description>

      <title>The Wisdom of Intellectually Humble Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People's collectively held beliefs can have significant social implications, including on democratic processes and policies. Unfortunately, as people interact with peers to form and update their beliefs, various cognitive and social biases can hinder their collective wisdom. In this paper, we probe whether and how the psychological construct of intellectual humility can modulate collective wisdom in a networked interaction setting. Through agent-based modeling and data-calibrated simulations, we provide a proof of concept demonstrating that intellectual humility can foster more accurate estimations while mitigating polarization in social networks. We investigate the mechanisms behind the performance improvements and confirm robustness across task settings and network structures. Our work can guide intervention designs to capitalize on the promises of intellectual humility in boosting collective wisdom in social networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>RECCS: Realistic Cluster Connectivity Simulator for Synthetic Network Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited availability of useful ground-truth communities in real-world networks presents a challenge to evaluating and selecting a "best" community detection method for a given network or family of networks. The use of synthetic networks with planted ground-truths is one way to address this challenge. While several synthetic network generators can be used for this purpose, Stochastic Block Models (SBMs), when provided input parameters from real-world networks and clusterings, are well suited to producing networks that retain the properties of the network they are intended to model. We report, however, that SBMs can produce disconnected ground truth clusters; even under conditions where the input clusters are connected. In this study, we describe the REalistic Cluster Connectivity Simulator (RECCS), which, while retaining approximately the same quality for other network and cluster parameters, creates an SBM synthetic network and then modifies it to ensure an improved fit to cluster connectivity. We report results using parameters obtained from clustered real-world networks ranging up to 13.9 million nodes in size, and demonstrate an improvement over the unmodified use of SBMs for network generation.</description>

      <title>Measuring social mobility in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex networks, the rich-get-richer effect (nodes with high degree at one point in time gain more degree in their future) is commonly observed. In practice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a preferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected nodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In this paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node degree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure people moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define hierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes over time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation statistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures the extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree gain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related to node neighbourhood.
  We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal networks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual nodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over time, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and their neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can discriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate artificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected range of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the "rich-get-richer" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a network. Overall, we show that measuring the hierarchical mobility of a temporal network is an invaluable resource for discovering its underlying structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>From Public Square to Echo Chamber: The Fragmentation of Online Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how social media algorithms and filter bubbles contribute to the fragmentation of online discourse, fostering ideological divides and undermining shared understanding. Drawing on Michael Sandels philosophical emphasis on community and shared values, the study explores how digital platforms amplify discrimination discourse including sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, and religious intolerance during periods of heightened societal tension. By analyzing the dynamics of digital communities, the research highlights mechanisms driving the emergence and evolution of discourse fragments in response to real world events. The findings reveal how social media structures exacerbate polarization, restrict cross group dialogue, and erode the collective reasoning essential for a just society. This study situates philosophical perspectives within a computational analysis of social media interactions, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges posed by fragmented discourse in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models' Accuracy in Emulating Human Experts' Evaluation of Public Sentiments about Heated Tobacco Products on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis of alternative tobacco products on social media is important for tobacco control research. Large Language Models (LLMs) can help streamline the labor-intensive human sentiment analysis process. This study examined the accuracy of LLMs in replicating human sentiment evaluation of social media messages about heated tobacco products (HTPs).
  The research used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo to classify 500 Facebook and 500 Twitter messages, including anti-HTPs, pro-HTPs, and neutral messages. The models evaluated each message up to 20 times, and their majority label was compared to human evaluators.
  Results showed that GPT-3.5 accurately replicated human sentiment 61.2% of the time for Facebook messages and 57.0% for Twitter messages. GPT-4 Turbo performed better, with 81.7% accuracy for Facebook and 77.0% for Twitter. Using three response instances, GPT-4 Turbo achieved 99% of the accuracy of twenty instances. GPT-4 Turbo also had higher accuracy for anti- and pro-HTPs messages compared to neutral ones. Misclassifications by GPT-3.5 often involved anti- or pro-HTPs messages being labeled as neutral or irrelevant, while GPT-4 Turbo showed improvements across all categories.
  In conclusion, LLMs can be used for sentiment analysis of HTP-related social media messages, with GPT-4 Turbo reaching around 80% accuracy compared to human experts. However, there's a risk of misrepresenting overall sentiment due to differences in accuracy across sentiment categories.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Joint Predictive Embedding and Bayesian Inference in Graph Self Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

      <title>On Bob Dylan: A Computational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cass Sunstein's essay 'On Bob Dylan' describes Dylan's 'dishabituating' style -- a constant refusal to conform to expectation and a penchant for reinventing his musical and lyrical identity. In this paper, I extend Sunstein's observations through a large-scale computational analysis of Dylan's lyrics from 1962 to 2012. Using o3-mini-high (a large language model), I extract concept-to-concept relationships from the lyrics and construct directed knowledge graphs that capture Dylan's thematic structure. I then quantify shifts in sentiment, metaphorical expression, thematic diversity, and network complexity over time. The results indicate that Dylan's lyrics increasingly rely on metaphor, display an evolving sentiment profile, and exhibit heightened dishabituation -- measured here as a growing variance in the network centrality of key concepts. I also find that references to movement, protest, and mythic imagery fluctuate in ways that align with well-known phases of Dylan's career, reflecting the dynamic and unpredictable quality of his art. These findings not only deepen our empirical understanding of Sunstein's thesis but also introduce a novel computational method for analyzing an artist's evolution-offering broader applicability to the study of cultural and creative change.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Enterprise Social Media on Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs) are web-based platforms with standard social media functionality, e.g., communicating with others, posting links and files, liking content, etc., yet all users are part of the same company. The first contribution of this work is the use of a difference-in-differences analysis of $99$ companies to measure the causal impact of ESMPs on companies' communication networks across the full spectrum of communication technologies used within companies: email, instant messaging, and ESMPs. Adoption caused companies' communication networks to grow denser and more well-connected by adding new, novel ties that often, but not exclusively, involve communication from one to many employees. Importantly, some new ties also bridge otherwise separate parts of the corporate communication network. The second contribution of this work, utilizing data on Microsoft's own communication network, is understanding how these communication technologies connect people across the corporate hierarchy. Compared to email and instant messaging, ESMPs excel at connecting nodes distant in the corporate hierarchy both vertically (between leaders and employees) and horizontally (between employees in similar roles but different sectors). Also, influence in ESMPs is more `democratic' than elsewhere, with high-influence nodes well-distributed across the corporate hierarchy. Overall, our results suggest that ESMPs boost information flow within companies and increase employees' attention to what is happening outside their immediate working group, above and beyond email and instant messaging.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Assist Annotators in Identifying Morality Frames? -- Case Study on Vaccination Debate on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01991v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, social media is pivotal in shaping public discourse, especially on polarizing issues like vaccination, where diverse moral perspectives influence individual opinions. In NLP, data scarcity and complexity of psycholinguistic tasks, such as identifying morality frames, make relying solely on human annotators costly, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency due to cognitive load. To address these issues, we leverage large language models (LLMs), which are adept at adapting new tasks through few-shot learning, utilizing a handful of in-context examples coupled with explanations that connect examples to task principles. Our research explores LLMs' potential to assist human annotators in identifying morality frames within vaccination debates on social media. We employ a two-step process: generating concepts and explanations with LLMs, followed by human evaluation using a "think-aloud" tool. Our study shows that integrating LLMs into the annotation process enhances accuracy, reduces task difficulty, lowers cognitive load, suggesting a promising avenue for human-AI collaboration in complex psycholinguistic tasks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to indicate friendly or antagonistic interactions, offer a natural framework for studying polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in these networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political division, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify groups that are cohesive internally yet antagonistic externally, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we address this problem by identifying $k$ polarized communities that are large, dense, and balanced in size. We develop an approach based on Frank-Wolfe optimization, leading to a local search procedure with provable convergence guarantees. Our method is both scalable and efficient, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while remaining competitive in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- the graph structure and the node features -- , we introduce RINGS, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., by quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing, from a distinct angle, the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for graph-learning dataset evaluation in an extensive set of experiments and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a first step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</description>

      <title>Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02451v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Stricter Content Moderation on Parler's Users' Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms employ various content moderation techniques to remove harmful, offensive, and hate speech content. The moderation level varies across platforms; even over time, it can evolve in a platform. For example, Parler, a fringe social media platform popular among conservative users, was known to have the least restrictive moderation policies, claiming to have open discussion spaces for their users. However, after linking the 2021 US Capitol Riots and the activity of some groups on Parler, such as QAnon and Proud Boys, on January 12, 2021, Parler was removed from the Apple and Google App Store and suspended from Amazon Cloud hosting service. Parler would have to modify their moderation policies to return to these online stores. After a month of downtime, Parler was back online with a new set of user guidelines, which reflected stricter content moderation, especially regarding the \emph{hate speech} policy. In this paper, we studied the moderation changes performed by Parler and their effect on the toxicity of its content. We collected a large longitudinal Parler dataset with 17M parleys from 432K active users from February 2021 to January 2022, after its return to the Internet and App Store. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effectiveness of content moderation techniques using data-driven approaches and also the first Parler dataset after its brief hiatus. Our quasi-experimental time series analysis indicates that after the change in Parler's moderation, the severe forms of toxicity (above a threshold of 0.5) immediately decreased and sustained. In contrast, the trend did not change for less severe threats and insults (a threshold between 0.5 - 0.7). Finally, we found an increase in the factuality of the news sites being shared, as well as a decrease in the number of conspiracy or pseudoscience sources being shared.</description>

      <title>P4GCN: Vertical Federated Social Recommendation with Privacy-Preserving Two-Party Graph Convolution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized for social recommendation systems. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improved Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying edge-dense communities that are also well-connected is an important aspect of understanding community structure. Prior work has shown that community detection methods can produce poorly connected communities, and some can even produce internally disconnected communities. In this study we evaluate the connectivity of communities obtained using Stochastic Block Models. We find that SBMs produce internally disconnected communities from real-world networks. We present a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), which repeatedly removes small edge cuts until the communities meet a user-specified threshold for well-connectivity. Our study using a large collection of synthetic networks based on clustered real-world networks shows that using WCC as a post-processing tool with SBM community detection typically improves clustering accuracy. WCC is fast enough to use on networks with millions of nodes and is freely available in open source form.</description>

      <title>Broadcasting in random recursive dags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A uniform $k$-{\sc dag} generalizes the uniform random recursive tree by picking $k$ parents uniformly at random from the existing nodes. It starts with $k$ ''roots''. Each of the $k$ roots is assigned a bit. These bits are propagated by a noisy channel. The parents' bits are flipped with probability $p$, and a majority vote is taken. When all nodes have received their bits, the $k$-{\sc dag} is shown without identifying the roots. The goal is to estimate the majority bit among the roots. We identify the threshold for $p$ as a function of $k$ below which the majority rule among all nodes yields an error $c+o(1)$ with $c&lt;1/2$. Above the threshold the majority rule errs with probability $1/2+o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Interaction Matters: An Evaluation Framework for Interactive Dialogue Assessment on English Second Language Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation framework for interactive dialogue assessment in the context of English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers. Our framework collects dialogue-level interactivity labels (e.g., topic management; 4 labels in total) and micro-level span features (e.g., backchannels; 17 features in total). Given our annotated data, we study how the micro-level features influence the (higher level) interactivity quality of ESL dialogues by constructing various machine learning-based models. Our results demonstrate that certain micro-level features strongly correlate with interactivity quality, like reference word (e.g., she, her, he), revealing new insights about the interaction between higher-level dialogue quality and lower-level linguistic signals. Our framework also provides a means to assess ESL communication, which is useful for language assessment.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>Embracing Dialectic Intersubjectivity: Coordination of Different Perspectives in Content Analysis with LLM Persona Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study attempts to advancing content analysis methodology from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation of this approach, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, examining patterns across these models. By assessing each model's alignment with ideological perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing could be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). Findings reveal that partisan persona LLMs exhibit stronger ideological biases when processing politically congruent content. Additionally, intercoder reliability is higher among same-partisan personas compared to cross-partisan pairs. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research, enabling simulations of real-world implications.</description>
