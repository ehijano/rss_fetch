Abstract: Modular composition is the problem of computing the coefficient vector of the polynomial $f(g(x)) \bmod h(x)$, given as input the coefficient vectors of univariate polynomials $f$, $g$, and $h$ over an underlying field $\mathbb{F}$. While this problem is known to be solvable in nearly-linear time over finite fields due to work of Kedlaya &amp; Umans, no such near-linear-time algorithms are known over infinite fields, with the fastest known algorithm being from a recent work of Neiger, Salvy, Schost &amp; Villard that takes $O(n^{1.43})$ field operations on inputs of degree $n$. In this work, we show that for any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, modular composition is in the border of algebraic circuits with division gates of nearly-linear size and polylogarithmic depth. Moreover, this circuit family can itself be constructed in near-linear time.
  Our techniques also extend to other algebraic problems, most notably to the problem of computing greatest common divisors of univariate polynomials. We show that over any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, the GCD of two univariate polynomials can be computed (piecewise) in the border sense by nearly-linear-size and polylogarithmic-depth algebraic circuits with division gates, where the circuits themselves can be constructed in near-linear time. While univariate polynomial GCD is known to be computable in near-linear time by the Knuth--Sch\"{o}nhage algorithm, or by constant-depth algebraic circuits from a recent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson, obtaining a parallel algorithm that simultaneously achieves polylogarithmic depth and near-linear work remains an open problem of great interest. Our result shows such an upper bound in the setting of border complexity.</description>
