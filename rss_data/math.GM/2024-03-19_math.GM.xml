      <title>Location of Zeros of Holomorphic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, various results will be demonstrated that enable the delimitation of a zero-free region for holomorphic functions on a set $K$, studying the behavior of their imaginary or real part on the boundary of $K$. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the distribution of zeros, shedding light on the intricate nature of holomorphic functions within the specified set.</description>

      <title>Fractal Nambu Mechanics: Extending Dynamics with Fractal Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the principles of Nambu mechanics by incorporating fractal calculus. This extension introduces Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics that incorporate fractal derivatives. By doing so, we broaden the scope of our analysis to encompass the dynamics of fractal systems, enabling us to capture their intricate and self-similar properties. This novel approach opens up new avenues for understanding and modeling complex fractal structures, thereby advancing our comprehension of these intricate phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Graph Fractional Fourier Transform in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) leverages the inherent signal structure within graphs to extract high-dimensional data without relying on translation invariance. It has emerged as a crucial tool across multiple fields, including learning and processing of various networks, data analysis, and image processing. In this paper, we introduce the graph fractional Fourier transform in Hilbert space (HGFRFT), which provides additional fractional analysis tools for generalized GSP by extending Hilbert space and vertex domain Fourier analysis to fractional order. First, we establish that the proposed HGFRFT extends traditional GSP, accommodates graphs on continuous domains, and facilitates joint time-vertex domain transform while adhering to critical properties such as additivity, commutativity, and invertibility. Second, to process generalized graph signals in the fractional domain, we explore the theory behind filtering and sampling of signals in the fractional domain. Finally, our simulations and numerical experiments substantiate the advantages and enhancements yielded by the HGFRFT.</description>

      <title>Closed Form for Half-Area Overlap Offset of 2 Unit Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation between the centers of two unit circles such that their overlapping area is exactly half of each's area is known to be around $0.8079455\dots$ (OEIS A133741). However, no closed form of this number is known. Here, we determine its closed form representation in terms of the inverse regularized beta function.</description>

      <title>A non-Newtonian some partner curves in multiplicative Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to characterize pairs of curves within multiplicative (non-Newtonian) spaces. Specifically, we investigate how famous curve pairs such as Bertrand partner curves, Mannheim partner curves, which are prominent in differential geometry, are transformed under the influence of multiplicative analysis. By leveraging the relationships between multiplicative Frenet vectors, we introduce multiplicative versions of Bertrand, Mannheim curve pairs. Subsequently, we characterize these curve pairs using multiplicative arguments. Examples are provided, and multiplicative graphs are presented to enhance understanding of the subject matter. Through this analysis, we aim to elucidate the behavior and properties of these curve pairs within the context of multiplicative geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, spherical indicatrices of a curve and helices are re-examined using both the algebraic structure and the geometric structure of non-Newtonian (multiplicative) Euclidean space. Indicatrices of a multiplicative curve on the multiplicative sphere in multiplicative space are obtained. In addition, multiplicative general helix, multiplicative slant helix and multiplicative clad and multiplicative g-clad helix characterizations are provided. Finally, examples and drawings are given.</description>
