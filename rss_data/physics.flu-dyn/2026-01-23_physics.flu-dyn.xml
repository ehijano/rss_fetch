      <title>Dynamical Characteristics of the Body-Caudal Fin Joint of a Carangiform Swimmer and its Influence on Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of fish swimming depend on the interaction between the undulation of the body and the flapping of the caudal fin. This study develops a computational framework of a Jackfish-inspired swimmer with an independently mounted caudal fin that pitches passively under fluid forces and a nonlinear torsional spring. The fin synchronizes with the body when damping and stiffness parameters are tuned correctly, producing passive pitching that closely resembles to the displacement of the actively pitching tail. At Re = 3000, synchronized passive pitching generates coherent hairpin and ring vortices that reinforce streamwise momentum and contribute to thrust, whereas larger phase differences lead to wake spread in lateral direction and drag-dominated behavior. These results reveal that nonlinear peduncle mechanics naturally regulate amplitude, phase, and recoil, offering a biologically inspired pathway toward underwater robotic design using passive kinematics.</description>

      <title>Study of the Effects of Artificial Dissipation and Other Numerical Parameters on Shock Wave Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects induced by numerical schemes and mesh geometry on the solution of two-dimensional supersonic inviscid flows are investigated in the context of the compressible Euler equations. Five different finite-difference schemes are considered: the Beam and Warming implicit approximate factorization algorithm, the original Steger and Warming flux vector splitting algorithm, the van Leer approach on performing the flux vector splitting and two different novel finite-difference interpretations of the Liou AUSM+ scheme. Special focus is given to the shock wave resolution capabilities of each scheme for the solution of an external supersonic inviscid flows around a blunt body. Significant changes in the shock structure are observed, mainly due to special properties of the scheme in use and the influence of the domain transformation procedure. Perturbations in the supersonic flow upstream of the shock are also seen in the solution, which is a non-physical behavior. Freestream subtraction, flux limiting and the explicit addition of artificial dissipation are employed in order to circumvent these problems. One of the AUSM+ formulations presented here is seen to be particularly more robust in avoiding the appearance of some of these numerically-induced disturbances and non-physical characteristics in the solution. Good agreement is achieved with both numerical and experimental results available in the literature.}</description>

      <title>Numerical Aspects of Gradient Reconstruction Schemes Applied to Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on the study of three gradient reconstruction techniques applied to the calculation of viscous terms in a cell-centered, finite volume formulation for general unstructured grids. The work also addresses different ways of formulating the limiter functions necessary to maintain stability in the presence of flow discontinuities. The flows of interest are simulated using the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the negative Spalart-Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. Definition of interface inviscid terms uses the Roe approximate Riemann solver, whereas the interface viscous terms are calculated with a standard centered scheme together with appropriate definitions of the interface gradients. Steady state solutions are obtained using an implicit time-integration method, together with a novel convergence acceleration technique. This new approach defines a set of three simple rules for controlling the global CFL number based on the residue evolution. The work considers three test cases, namely, the subsonic bump-in-channel flow, the subsonic NASA high-lift Common Research Model multielement airfoil and the transonic ONERA M6 wing. Present results are compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature. Severe numerical instabilities are observed when the simplest gradient reconstruction technique is used, while more sophisticated formulations are able to provide excellent agreement with the existing literature. Current results are demonstrated to be highly insensitive to modifications made to the numerical flux entropy fix terms. Integrated aerodynamic forces are shown to be mildly dependent on the limiter formulation used, even in the absence of shock waves. The proposed convergence acceleration procedure manages to quickly drive the residue terms to machine zero, provided no major instabilities are present.</description>

      <title>Structures of elastoinertial turbulence in pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a self-sustaining chaotic state resulting from the interplay between inertia and elasticity in the flow of dilute polymeric solutions, and its emergence is believed to limit the achievable drag reduction in turbulence flow using polymer additives. In the present study, we introduce a viscoelastic variant of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (VESPOD) that decomposes velocity and polymeric stress fields of EIT together into well-defined orthogonal oscillating modes such that the decomposition is optimal in the terms of the total mechanical energy of the flow. Using this technique, we investigate the dominant coherently evolving structures underlying the dynamics of EIT in axisymmetric pipe flow. By analyzing distinct peaks in the leading eigenvalue of the VESPOD eigenvalue spectrum, we find that the dynamics of EIT in pipe flow is dominated by three distinct families of traveling waves, where the higher wavenumber structures of each family are simple harmonics of their respective fundamental waves. The radial velocity fields of the traveling waves are characterized by the formation of large-scale structures spanning the pipe radial direction. However, the polymeric stress fields corresponding to them are characterized by the formation of thin inclined sheets of high stress fluctuations at the critical layers of the respective waves, i.e.~ the locations where the wave speed of the VESPOD mode matches the mean streamwise velocity. Additionally, these sheets exhibit nested structures, where the polymeric sheets of faster waves are confined by those of the immediately slower waves.</description>

      <title>Turbulent hydrogen premixed flames at high pressure and high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined influence of elevated pressure and temperature, representative of gas-turbine operating conditions, on lean premixed hydrogen flames is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a turbulent jet. Three cases are considered: 1 atm/298 K, 5 atm/472 K, and 20 atm/700 K, scaled to maintain the same jet Reynolds number and nominal Karlovitz number in the unburnt mixture, enabling a direct comparison of flame-turbulence interactions. Although the combined effects are moderate overall due to compensating influences, measurable differences arise in flame structure and turbulence-flame coupling. They are driven by reduced turbulence dissipation within the flame at high pressure and temperature, which enhances the interaction between turbulence and thermodiffusive effects. Finally, the tangential strain rate exhibits the same universal Kolmogorov scaling observed in homogeneous-isotropic turbulence and in methane flames, confirming its robustness for modelling turbulence</description>

      <title>Assimilating rough features: A data-driven framework to infer rough wall properties from sparse experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface roughness influences turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) primarily through the roughness function $\Delta U^+$ and the equivalent sand-grain roughness height \(k_s\). Direct determination of \(k_s\) typically requires detailed velocity and wall-shear stress measurements, which are often impractical. As an alternative, this study presents a data assimilation framework that modifies a smooth-wall Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) baseline to match sparse rough-wall particle image velocimetry (PIV) data in the fully rough regime. Through this approach, secondary variables such as the friction velocity, \(u_\tau\), and \(k_s\) can be inferred from the assimilated flow fields. The assimilated TBL reproduces experimental velocity profiles within 1\% and predicts friction velocity within 1-6\% of the experimental measurements. Furthermore, the \(k_s\) values inferred from the assimilation also match the experimental data up to 1\%. These results demonstrate the potential of data assimilation as a cost-effective alternative to high-fidelity methods and support the generalisation of the framework to model streamwise-varying roughness by treating \(k_s\) as a function of fetch length.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Inviscid Fluid Dynamics and Aero-acoustics on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.
  Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.
  Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.</description>

      <title>Meshless Super-Resolution of Scattered Data via constrained RBFs and KNN-Driven Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel meshless method to achieve super resolution from scattered data obtained from sparse, randomly positioned sensors such as the particle tracers of particle tracking velocimetry. The method combines K Nearest Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with meshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025) and constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c RBFs, Sperotto et al. 2022). The main idea is to enhance the spatial resolution of flow fields by blending data from locally similar flow regions available in the time series. This similarity is assessed in terms of statistical coherency with leading features identified by meshless POD applied directly to scattered data, without interpolation onto a grid and relying instead on RBFs to compute the relevant inner products. The denser scattered distributions are then used within a constrained RBF framework to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that incorporates physical constraints. The approach is fully meshless and does not require a grid at any stage, offering flexibility in complex geometries. An ablation study highlights the role of penalties and physical constraints in regularizing the regression and ensuring physically consistent reconstructions. The method is validated using three dimensional measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment focuses on statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. Performance is evaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN PTV, and c RBFs. The results show improved accuracy, with an average error of about ten percent compared to twelve to thirteen percent for the other methods, nearly halved errors in reduced order reconstructions, and a higher frequency cutoff based on the noise floor.</description>

      <title>Pulsation of Burner-Stabilized CH4-O2 Flames Moderated by CO2 Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10905v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated the pulsating instability of burner-stabilized premixed CH4-O2 flames at various levels of CO2 dilution. Experiments were conducted using a water-cooled porous-plug burner of 18 mm diameter over a wide range of mixture compositions and flow rates, during which time-resolved measurements of flame chemiluminescence and gas temperature were obtained. The primary oscillation frequencies of the pulsating flames were determined using fast Fourier transform and harmonic power analysis. Phase-locked analysis of the chemiluminescence images revealed an interesting mode-transition phenomenon of the flame oscillations. Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat release rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic single-mode oscillations. At elevated flow rates, these oscillations were modulated by low-frequency flame flickering instabilities, which created sidebands around the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the flickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to multi-mode oscillations. Regime diagrams of the flame oscillation modes, as well as the stability boundaries, were obtained under various fuel flow rates. These findings can be useful for both fundamental research on flame dynamics and practical applications of CO2-moderated oxy-combustion.</description>

      <title>Multiphase modeling of anisotropic biomass particle pyrolysis accounting for particle deformation and coupled gas-phase dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical models of biomass particle pyrolysis focus on either the solid particle evolution or on the surrounding gas-phase dynamics, neglecting the coupled interactions between the two. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a single-grid model that fully resolves both phases without relying on sub-grid-scale correlations. The model adopts an Eulerian representation of the two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the interface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase pyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture the coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle shrinkage, combining different biomass conversion models into one unique framework. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in this multidimensional framework. The resulting model is independent of the number and shape of the particle, and demonstrates mass conservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental data, collected from wood particles in the centimetre scale and operating temperature between 400-700{\deg}C, shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and correct volatiles trends. Predicted char yields fall within 2% error range. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, with a 10% average error in the final particle shape, but they also highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution of the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the development of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups, developed within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer transition induced by surface roughness distributed over a low-pressure turbine blade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of a low-pressure turbine with roughness elements distributed over the blade surface have been performed. A series of fifteen cases with varying roughness heights and streamwise wavenumbers are introduced to present a systematic study of the effect of roughness on the various transition phenomena in the suction-side boundary layer. For cases with large roughness heights, the boundary layer is violently disturbed by the wake of rough elements in the leading edge (LE) region, and maintains the turbulent state over the whole blade suction-side. For cases with small roughness heights, however, the disturbances induced by the LE roughness are suppressed by the favourable pressure gradient in the downstream boundary layer, and the relaminarized flow does not undergo transition until the separation near the blade trailing edge (TE). Furthermore, the streamwise wavenumber of the distributed roughness plays an important role in cases with intermediate roughness height. Specifically, cases with larger streamwise slope show earlier transition induced by strong shear layer instability, which manages to suppress the mean flow separation near the TE region. Overall, the combined effect of several factors, including the geometric effect at the blade LE and TE, the complex pressure gradient distribution across the turbine vane, and the various roughness configurations, is responsible for the intriguing boundary layer behaviours in the present study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</description>
