      <title>A note on Fourier coefficients of Hecke eigenforms in short intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate large prime factors of Fourier coefficients of non-CM normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenforms in short intervals. One of the new ingredients involves deriving an explicit version of Chebotarev density theorem in an interval of length $\frac{x}{(\log x)^A}$ for any $A&gt;0$, modifying an earlier work of Balog and Ono. Furthermore, we need to strengthen a work of Rouse-Thorner to derive a lower bound for the largest prime factor of Fourier coefficients in an interval of length $x^{1/2 + \epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon &gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Regularization for multiple Eisenstein series of level $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bachmann and Tasaka discovered a relationship between multiple Eisenstein series (MES) of level 1 and formal iterated integrals corresponding to multiple zeta value (MZV). They also constructed shuffle regularized MES of level 1, which satisfies the shuffle relation that is same as multiple zeta values. Bachmann also constructed harmonic regularized MES. In this paper, we expand their results for arbitrary level and give some linear relations among MES of level N.</description>

      <title>Explicit estimates for the logarithmic derivative and the reciprocal of the Riemann zeta-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we improve on two explicit bounds of order $\log t$ for $\sigma$ close to $1$: $|\zeta'(\sigma +it)/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$ and $|1/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$. Our method provides marked improvements in the constants, especially with regards to the latter. These savings come from replacing a lemma of Borel and Carath\'{e}dory, with a Jensen-type one of Heath-Brown's.</description>

      <title>Effective correlation and decorrelation for newforms, and weak subconvexity for $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be spectrally normalized holomorphic newforms of even weight $k \geq2$ on $\Gamma_0(q)$. If $f\neq g$, then assume that $q$ is squarefree. For a nice test function $\psi$ supported on $\Gamma_0(1)\backslash\mathbb{H}$, we establish the best known bounds (uniform in $k$, $q$, and $\psi$) for \[ \int_{\Gamma_0(q)\backslash\mathbb{H}}\psi(z)f(z)\overline{g(z)}y^{k}\frac{dxdy}{y^2}-\mathbf{1}_{f = g}\frac{3}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma_0(1)\backslash\mathbb{H}}\psi(z)\frac{dx dy}{y^2}.\] When $f=g$, our results yield an effective holomorphic variant of quantum unique ergodicity, refining work of Holowinsky-Soundararajan and Nelson-Pitale-Saha. When $f \neq g$, our results extend and improve the effective decorrelation result of Huang for $q=1$. To prove our results, we refine Soundararajan's weak subconvexity bound for Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of $S$-arithmetic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the sign of the Euler characteristic of an $S$-arithmetic subgroup of a simple $k$-group over a number field $k$ depends on the $S$-congruence completion only. Consequently, the sign is a profinite invariant for such $S$-arithmetic groups with the congruence subgroup property. This generalizes previous work of the first author with Kionke-Raimbault-Sauer.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we address the problem of whether all solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ are generated by the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We consider the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations and demonstrate that, indeed, in this case, all solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions.</description>

      <title>The relatively perfect Greenberg transform and cycle class maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a scheme over a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, the Greenberg transform produces a new scheme over the residue field thicker than the special fiber. In this paper, we will generalize this transform to the case of imperfect residue field. We will then construct a certain kind of cycle class map defined on this generalized Greenberg transform applied to the N\'eron model of a semi-abelian variety, which takes values in the relatively perfect nearby cycle functor defined by Kato and the second author.</description>

      <title>Ap\'ery-like sequences defined by four-term recurrence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ap\'ery numbers may be defined by a cubic three-term recurrence relation, that is, a three-term relation where the coefficients are polynomials in the index of degree $3$.
  In this work, we first provide a systematic review of Ap\'ery numbers and other related sequences that satisfy quadratic or cubic three-term recurrence relations, and show how they are interrelated and how they may be classified. This leads to sequences defined by cubic $k$-term recurrence relations. The cases corresponding to $k=2$ in this framework lead to Ramanujan's theories of elliptic functions to alternative bases, while the cases corresponding to $k=3$ correspond to the Ap\'ery, Domb, Almkvist--Zudilin numbers and other sequences that are well-studied.
  We conduct a detailed analysis for the case $k=4$. Some of the sequences that arise are new. Of particular interest are ten sequences that are said to be self-starting in the sense that a single initial condition is enough to start the recurrence relation. Of additional interest are two sequences which take values in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and two others with values in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$. Congruence properties and asymptotic expansions for the ten self-starting sequences are investigated and several conjectures are presented. For example, we conjecture that the integer-valued sequence defined by the recurrence relation \begin{align*} (n+1)^3T(n+1) &amp;=2(2n+1)(5n^2+5n+2)T(n) \\ &amp;\qquad -8n(7n^2+1)T(n-1)+22n(2n-1)(n-1)T(n-2) \end{align*} and initial condition $T(0)=1$ satisfies a Lucas congruence for every prime $p$. Moreover, the sequence is conjectured to satisfy the supercongruence $$ T(pn) \equiv T(n) \pmod{p^2} \quad\text{for all positive integers $n$} $$ if $p=2,\;59$ or $5581$, and for no other primes $p&lt;10^4$.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of high traces of random matrices over finite fields and cancellation in character sums of high conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a random matrix distributed according to uniform probability measure on the finite general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. We show that $\mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ equidistributes on $\mathbb{F}_q$ as $n \to \infty$ as long as $\log k=o(n^2)$ and that this range is sharp. We also show that nontrivial linear combinations of $\mathrm{Tr}(g^1),\ldots, \mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ equidistribute as long as $\log k =o(n)$ and this range is sharp as well. Previously equidistribution of either a single trace or a linear combination of traces was only known for $k \le c_q n$, where $c_q$ depends on $q$, due to work of the first author and Rodgers.
  We reduce the problem to exhibiting cancellation in certain short character sums in function fields. For the equidistribution of $\mathrm{Tr}(g^k)$ we end up showing that certain explicit character sums modulo $T^{k+1}$ exhibit cancellation when averaged over monic polynomials of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ as long as $\log k = o(n^2)$. This goes far beyond the classical range $\log k =o(n)$ due to Montgomery and Vaughan. To study these sums we build on the argument of Montgomery and Vaughan but exploit additional symmetry present in the considered sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider two families of $g$-dimensional abelian varieties induced by two distinct rational maps on the same variety $\overline{\mathcal A}$ onto two bases $\overline S_1$ and $\overline S_2$ and having big common domain of definition. Two non-torsion sections of these families induce two (birational) fiberwise translations on $\overline{\mathcal A}$, respectively. We show that if $\dim \overline S_1+\dim \overline S_2\le 2g$, the points with finite orbit under the action of a certain subset of the group generated by both translations lie in a proper Zariski closed subset that can be described to a certain extent. Our work is a higher dimensional generalization of a result of Corvaja, Tsimermann and Zannier.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Wooley and lower bounds for cubic hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{Q}}^{n-1}$ be a cubic hypersurface cut out by the vanishing of a non-degenerate rational cubic form in $n$ variables. Let $N(X,B)$ denote the number of rational points on $X$ of height at most $B$. In this article we obtain lower bounds for $N(X,B)$ for cubic hypersufaces, provided only that $n$ is large enough. In particular, we show that $N(X,B) \gg B^{n-9}$ if $n \geq 39$, thereby proving a conjecture of T. D. Wooley for non-conical cubic hypersurfaces with large enough dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.09160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish Hyodo--Kato theory with compact support for semistable schemes through rigid analytic methods. To this end we introduce several types of log rigid cohomology with compact support. moreover we show that additional structures on the (rigid) Hyodo--Kato cohomology and the Hyodo--Kato map introduced in our previous paper are compatible with Poincar\'{e} duality. Compared to the crystalline approach, the constructions are explicit yet versatile, and hence suitable for computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Browning and Vishe used the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to show the moduli space of rational curves on smooth hypersurfaces of low degree is irreducible and of the expected dimension. We reinterpret the circle method geometrically and prove a generalization for higher genus smooth projective curves. In particular, we explain how the geometry of numbers can be understood via the Beauville-Laszlo theorem in terms of vector bundles on curves and their slopes, allowing us to prove a higher genus variant of Davenport's shrinking lemma. As a corollary, we apply this result to show the Fujita invariant of any proper subvariety of a smooth hypersurface of low degree is less than 1.</description>
