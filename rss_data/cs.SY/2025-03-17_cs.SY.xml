      <title>Estimating Control Barriers from Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based methods for constructing control barrier functions (CBFs) are gaining popularity for ensuring safe robot control. A major limitation of existing methods is their reliance on extensive sampling over the state space or online system interaction in simulation. In this work we propose a novel framework for learning neural CBFs through a fixed, sparsely-labeled dataset collected prior to training. Our approach introduces new annotation techniques based on out-of-distribution analysis, enabling efficient knowledge propagation from the limited labeled data to the unlabeled data. We also eliminate the dependency on a high-performance expert controller, and allow multiple sub-optimal policies or even manual control during data collection. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world platforms. With limited amount of offline data, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for dynamic obstacle avoidance, demonstrating statistically safer and less conservative maneuvers compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>On Dynamic Mode Decomposition of Control-affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on the theoretical foundations for dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of control-affine dynamical systems by leveraging the theory of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Specifically, control Liouville operators and control occupation kernels are used to separate the drift dynamics from the input dynamics. A provably convergent finite-rank estimation of a compact control Liouville operator is obtained, provided sufficiently rich data are available. A matrix representation of the finite-rank operator is used to construct a data-driven representation of its singular values, left singular functions, and right singular functions. The singular value decomposition is used to generate a data-driven model of the control-affine nonlinear system. The developed method generates a model that can be used to predict the trajectories of the system in response to any admissible control input. Numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed technique.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Aware Microgrid Optimal Planning: Integrating Dynamic Energy Efficiencies and Second-Life Battery Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional microgrid planning often overlooks PV and BESS degradation or relies on complex, downscaled models, leading to unreliable, costly and suboptimal investment decisions. This paper presents a degradation-based investment optimization (DBIO) methodology for long-term microgrid planning. The model optimally sizes and schedules PV, BESS, and controllable distributed energy resources, while considering technical, financial, and degradation characteristics. We first developed a cumulative multi-year optimization model as a benchmark, excluding BESS efficiency fade and capacity degradation that would be captured in the next step, to ensure convergence. Subsequently, a yearly validation model was iteratively solved for each year in the planning horizon, updating energy efficiencies of PV and BESS, along with BESS capacity, based on annual degradation, ensuring the reliability of initial solution. An iterative refinement process further adjusts BESS capacity to eliminate load shedding while minimizing costs. Sensitivity analyses on PV efficiency degradation rates, second-life battery (SLB) capital cost, and grid tariffs further explore their economic implications. Results show that degradation significantly impacts resource allocation, with ignored degradation risking reliability, potential load shedding, and blackout costs, while SLBs provide cost-saving opportunities. The DBIO framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable solution for microgrid planning, with broader applications in grid-scale asset management.</description>

      <title>Adaptive model predictive control for traffic signal timing with unknown demand and parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper designs traffic signal control policies for a network of signalized intersections without knowing the demand and parameters. Within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, control policies consist of an algorithm that estimates parameters and a one-step MPC that computes control inputs using estimated parameters. The algorithm switches between different terminal sets of the MPC to explore different regions of the state space, where different parameters are identifiable. The one-step MPC minimizes a cost that approximates the sum of squares of all the queue lengths within a constant and does not require demand information. We show that the algorithm can estimate parameters exactly in finite time, and the one-step MPC renders maximum throughput in terms of input-to-state practical stability. Simulations indicate better transient performance regarding queue lengths under our proposed policies than existing ones.</description>

      <title>Safe Control of Second-Order Systems with Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer a powerful tool for enforcing safety specifications in control synthesis. This paper deals with the problem of constructing valid CBFs. Given a second-order system and any desired safety set with linear boundaries in the position space, we construct a provably control-invariant subset of this desired safety set. The constructed subset does not sacrifice any positions allowed by the desired safety set, which can be nonconvex. We show how our construction can also meet safety specification on the velocity. We then demonstrate that if the system satisfies standard Euler-Lagrange systems properties then our construction can also handle constraints on the allowable control inputs. We finally show the efficacy of the proposed method in a numerical example of keeping a 2D robot arm safe from collision.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Power System Operation Considering Varying Impacts of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating prediction and optimization enhances decision-making quality by yielding near optimal solutions. Given that prediction errors associated with multiple uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making, improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative importance of each uncertainty for specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of weighted predictions for downstream optimization as compared to perfect predictions. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, WPO framework enables adaptive uncertainty impact assessment and integrated learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we construct a surrogate model to establish the mapping between weights and PDPL, where multi-task learning and enhanced graph convolutional networks are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms traditional methods by achieving a much smaller PDPL within acceptable computational time.</description>

      <title>Approximate Reachable Sets using Singularly Perturbed Differential Games, with Application to Biological System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is an exciting framework used for control of safety-critical systems with nonlinear and possibly uncertain dynamics. However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Impact of IBR on the Frequency Dynamics in the Brazilian Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the impact of inverter-based resources (IBRs) on the frequency dynamics of the Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS) is evaluated. A measurement-based framework is proposed to assess the impact of IBR penetration on the system-wide and regional/local frequency dynamic. The analysis leverages data from a low-voltage wide area monitoring system (WAMS) and publicly available historical generation records from the Brazilian System Operator. A methodology is introduced to extract local frequency fluctuations across regions using a variational mode decomposition (VMD) approach. The findings reveal a continuous degradation in the system-wide frequency and local frequency variations, underscoring the need for enhanced regional monitoring and evaluation metrics to maintain frequency stability in large-scale interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Inverter Control with Time-Varying and Nonconvex State and Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into modern power systems poses significant challenges for maintaining reliable operation under dynamic and constrained conditions. This paper focuses on the power tracking problem for grid-connected IBRs, addressing the complexities introduced by voltage and power factor constraints. Voltage constraints, being time-varying and nonlinear input constraints, often conflict with power factor constraints, which are state constraints. These conflicts, coupled with stability requirements, add substantial complexity to control design. To overcome these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient static state-feedback controller that guarantees stability and satisfies operational constraints. The concept of achievability is introduced to evaluate whether power setpoints can be accurately tracked while adhering to all constraints. Using a parameterization framework and the S-lemma, we develop criteria to assess and maximize the continuous achievable region for IBR operation. This framework allows system operators to ensure safety and stability by precomputing a finite set of control gains, significantly reducing online computational requirements. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling time-varying grid disturbances and achieving reliable control performance.</description>

      <title>Six-DoF Stewart Platform Motion Simulator Control using Switchable Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to excellent mechanism characteristics of high rigidity, maneuverability and strength-to-weight ratio, 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Stewart structure is widely adopted to construct flight simulator platforms for replicating motion feelings during training pilots. Unlike conventional serial link manipulator based mechanisms, Upset Prevention and Recovery Training (UPRT) in complex flight status is often accompanied by large speed and violent rate of change in angular velocity of the simulator. However, Classical Washout Filter (CWF) based Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA) shows limitations in providing rapid response to drive motors to satisfy high accuracy performance requirements. This paper aims at exploiting Model Predictive Control (MPC) based MCA which is proved to be efficient in Hexapod-based motion simulators through controlling over limited linear workspace. With respect to uncertainties and control solution errors from the extraction of Terminal Constraints (COTC), this paper proposes a Switchable Model Predictive Control (S-MPC) based MCA under model adaptive architecture to mitigate the solution uncertainties and inaccuracies. It is verified that high accurate tracking is achievable using the MPC-based MCA with COTC within the simulator operating envelope. The proposed method provides optimal tracking solutions by switching to MPC based MCA without COTC outside the operating envelope. By demonstrating the UPRT with horizontal stall conditions following Average Absolute Scale(AAS) evaluation criteria, the proposed S-MPC based MCA outperforms MPC based MCA and SWF based MCA by 42.34% and 65.30%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based MPC for Efficient Control of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position via model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to offer benefits for fuel-efficient autonomous driving. However, optimizing both the vehicle's continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions may be too computationally intensive for a real-time implementation. This work proposes a learning-based MPC scheme to address this issue. A policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction horizon of the MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved online. In simulation, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Controlled Switching Approach for Inrush Current Minimization in Power Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are essential components for the reliable operation of power grids. The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Randomized Detector Tuning for Attack Impact Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detector tuning against false data injection attacks. In particular, we consider an adversary injecting false sensor data to maximize the state deviation of the plant, referred to as impact, whilst being stealthy. To minimize the impact of stealthy attacks, inspired by moving target defense, the operator randomly switches the detector thresholds. In this paper, we theoretically derive the sufficient (and in some cases necessary) conditions under which the impact of stealthy attacks can be made smaller with randomized switching of detector thresholds compared to static thresholds. We establish the conditions for the stateless ($\chi^2$) and the stateful (CUSUM) detectors. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Real-World Energy Management Dataset from a Smart Company Building for Optimization and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large real-world dataset obtained from monitoring a smart company facility over the course of six years, from 2018 to 2023. The dataset includes energy consumption data from various facility areas and components, energy production data from a photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant, operational data from heating and cooling systems, and weather data from an on-site weather station. The measurement sensors installed throughout the facility are organized in a hierarchical metering structure with multiple sub-metering levels, which is reflected in the dataset. The dataset contains measurement data from 72 energy meters, 9 heat meters and a weather station. Both raw and processed data at different processing levels, including labeled issues, is available. In this paper, we describe the data acquisition and post-processing employed to create the dataset. The dataset enables the application of a wide range of methods in the domain of energy management, including optimization, modeling, and machine learning to optimize building operations and reduce costs and carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant control of nonlinear systems: An inductive synthesis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actuator faults heavily affect the performance and stability of control systems, an issue that is even more critical for systems required to operate autonomously under adverse environmental conditions, such as unmanned vehicles. To this end, passive fault-tolerant control (PFTC) systems can be employed, namely fixed-gain control laws that guarantee stability both in the nominal case and in the event of faults. In this paper, we propose a counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS)-based approach to design reliable PFTC policies for nonlinear control systems affected by partial, or total, actuator faults. Our approach enjoys finite-time convergence guarantees and extends available techniques by considering nonlinear dynamics with possible fault conditions. Extensive numerical simulations illustrate how the proposed method can be applied to realistic operational scenarios involving the velocity and heading control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Our PFTC technique exhibits comparatively low synthesis time (i.e. minutes) and minimal computational requirements, which render it is suitable for embedded applications with limited availability of energy and onboard power resources.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reachability Analysis for Convolutional Neural Networks Using Hybrid Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedforward neural networks are widely used in autonomous systems, particularly for control and perception tasks within the system loop. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks necessitates formal verification before deployment in safety-critical applications. Existing set propagation-based reachability analysis methods for feedforward neural networks often struggle to achieve both scalability and accuracy. This work presents a novel set-based approach for computing the reachable sets of convolutional neural networks. The proposed method leverages a hybrid zonotope representation and an efficient neural network reduction technique, providing a flexible trade-off between computational complexity and approximation accuracy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Converging Time-Discounted Ergodicity on Graphs for Active Inspection of Confined Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic exploration has spawned a lot of interest in mobile robotics due to its ability to design time trajectories that match desired spatial coverage statistics. However, current ergodic approaches are for continuous spaces, which require detailed sensory information at each point and can lead to fractal-like trajectories that cannot be tracked easily. This paper presents a new ergodic approach for graph-based discretization of continuous spaces. It also introduces a new time-discounted ergodicity metric, wherein early visitations of information-rich nodes are weighted more than late visitations. A Markov chain synthesized using a convex program is shown to converge more rapidly to time-discounted ergodicity than the traditional fastest mixing Markov chain. The resultant ergodic traversal method is used within a hierarchical framework for active inspection of confined spaces with the goal of detecting anomalies robustly using SLAM-driven Bayesian hypothesis testing. Both simulation and physical experiments on a ground robot show the advantages of this framework over greedy and random exploration methods for left-behind foreign object debris detection in a ballast tank.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven model on various dynamic trajectory tracking tasks on a high-fidelity and high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot. Notably, we find that four- or five-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to 10 across all closed-loop control tasks.</description>

      <title>From Abstraction to Reality: DARPA's Vision for Robust Sim-to-Real Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DARPA Transfer from Imprecise and Abstract Models to Autonomous Technologies (TIAMAT) program aims to address rapid and robust transfer of autonomy technologies across dynamic and complex environments, goals, and platforms. Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap -- such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization -- TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has had success in virtual and simulated domains, but due to key differences between simulated and real-world environments, DRL-trained policies have had limited success in real-world applications. To assist researchers to bridge the \textit{sim-to-real gap}, in this paper, we describe a low-cost physical inverted pendulum apparatus and software environment for exploring sim-to-real DRL methods. In particular, the design of our apparatus enables detailed examination of the delays that arise in physical systems when sensing, communicating, learning, inferring and actuating. Moreover, we wish to improve access to educational systems, so our apparatus uses readily available materials and parts to reduce cost and logistical barriers. Our design shows how commercial, off-the-shelf electronics and electromechanical and sensor systems, combined with common metal extrusions, dowel and 3D printed couplings provide a pathway for affordable physical DRL apparatus. The physical apparatus is complemented with a simulated environment implemented using a high-fidelity physics engine and OpenAI Gym interface.</description>

      <title>GP-enhanced Autonomous Drifting Framework using ADMM-based iLQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex challenge due to the highly nonlinear dynamics and the need for precise real-time control, especially in uncertain environments. To address these limitations, this paper presents a hierarchical control framework for autonomous vehicles drifting along general paths, primarily focusing on addressing model inaccuracies and mitigating computational challenges in real-time control. The framework integrates Gaussian Process (GP) regression with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR). GP regression effectively compensates for model residuals, improving accuracy in dynamic conditions. ADMM-based iLQR not only combines the rapid trajectory optimization of iLQR but also utilizes ADMM's strength in decomposing the problem into simpler sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with significant improvements in both drift trajectory tracking and computational efficiency. Our approach resulted in a 38$\%$ reduction in RMSE lateral error and achieved an average computation time that is 75$\%$ lower than that of the Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT).</description>

      <title>Flow-Aware Navigation of Magnetic Micro-Robots in Complex Fluids via PINN-Based Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated significant potential across various applications, including drug delivery and microsurgery, the open issue of precise navigation and control in complex fluid environments is crucial for in vivo implementation. This paper introduces a novel flow-aware navigation and control strategy for magnetic micro-robots that explicitly accounts for the impact of fluid flow on their movement. First, the proposed method employs a Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid velocity using local observations. Then, the predicted velocity is incorporated in a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to compensate for the predicted fluid velocity, thereby optimizing the micro-robot's performance. A series of simulation studies and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. This method enhances both planning accuracy and control precision, expanding the potential applications of magnetic micro-robots in fluid-affected environments typical of many medical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for computational power is driven by advancements in deep learning, the increasing need for big data processing, and the requirements of scientific simulations for academic and research purposes. Developing countries like Nepal often struggle with the resources needed to invest in new and better hardware for these purposes. However, optimizing and building on existing technology can still meet these computing demands effectively. To address these needs, we built a cluster using four NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPUs. The cluster consists of four nodes: one master node that controls and manages the entire cluster, and three compute nodes dedicated to processing tasks. The master node is equipped with all necessary software for package management, resource scheduling, and deployment, such as Anaconda and Slurm. In addition, a Network File Storage (NFS) system was integrated to provide the additional storage required by the cluster. Given that the cluster is accessible via ssh by a public domain address, which poses significant cybersecurity risks, we implemented fail2ban to mitigate brute force attacks and enhance security. Despite the continuous challenges encountered during the design and implementation process, this project demonstrates how powerful computational clusters can be built to handle resource-intensive tasks in various demanding fields.</description>

      <title>Certified Inductive Synthesis for Online Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fields such as autonomous and safety-critical systems, online optimization plays a crucial role in control and decision-making processes, often requiring the integration of continuous and discrete variables. These tasks are frequently modeled as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems, where feedback data are incorporated as parameters. However, solving MIPs within strict time constraints is challenging due to their $\mathcal{NP}$-complete nature. A promising solution to this challenge involves leveraging the largely invariant structure of these problems to perform most computations offline, thus enabling efficient online solving even on platforms with limited hardware capabilities. In this paper we present a novel implementation of this strategy that uses counterexample-guided inductive synthesis to split the MIP solution process into two stages. In the offline phase, we construct a mapping that provides feasible assignments for binary variables based on parameter values within a specified range. In the online phase, we solve the remaining continuous part of the problem by fixing the binary variables to the values predicted by this mapping. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and solution quality of this approach compared to standard mixed-integer solvers, highlighting its potential for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Torque Control of Exoskeletons under Spasticity Conditions via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spasticity is a common movement disorder symptom in individuals with cerebral palsy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, spinal cord injury and stroke, being one of the most disabling features in the progression of these diseases. Despite the potential benefit of using wearable robots to treat spasticity, their use is not currently recommended to subjects with a level of spasticity above ${1^+}$ on the Modified Ashworth Scale. The varying dynamics of this velocity-dependent tonic stretch reflex make it difficult to deploy safe personalized controllers. Here, we describe a novel adaptive torque controller via deep reinforcement learning (RL) for a knee exoskeleton under joint spasticity conditions, which accounts for task performance and interaction forces reduction. To train the RL agent, we developed a digital twin, including a musculoskeletal-exoskeleton system with joint misalignment and a differentiable spastic reflexes model for the muscles activation. Results for a simulated knee extension movement showed that the agent learns to control the exoskeleton for individuals with different levels of spasticity. The proposed controller was able to reduce maximum torques applied to the human joint under spastic conditions by an average of 10.6\% and decreases the root mean square until the settling time by 8.9\% compared to a conventional compliant controller.</description>

      <title>ARCAS: Adaptive Runtime System for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing disparity between CPU core counts and available memory bandwidth has intensified memory contention in servers. This particularly affects highly parallelizable applications, which must achieve efficient cache utilization to maintain performance as CPU core counts grow. Optimizing cache utilization, however, is complex for recent chiplet-based CPUs, whose partitioned L3 caches lead to varying latencies and bandwidths, even within a single NUMA domain. Classical NUMA optimizations and task scheduling approaches unfortunately fail to address the performance issues of chiplet-based CPUs.
  We describe Adaptive Runtime system for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling (ARCAS), a new runtime system designed for chiplet-based CPUs. ARCAS combines chiplet-aware task scheduling heuristics, hardware-aware memory allocation, and fine-grained performance monitoring to optimize workload execution. It implements a lightweight concurrency model that combines user-level thread features-such as individual stacks, per-task scheduling, and state management-with coroutine-like behavior, allowing tasks to suspend and resume execution at defined points while efficiently managing task migration across chiplets. Our evaluation across diverse scenarios shows ARCAS's effectiveness for optimizing the performance of memory-intensive parallel applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I present vectorable thrust control for different locomotion modes by a novel quadruped robot, SPIDAR, equipped with vectoring rotor in each link. First, the robot's unique mechanical design, the dynamics model, and the basic control framework for terrestrial/aerial locomotion are briefly introduced. Second, a vectorable thrust control method derived from the basic control framework for aerial locomotion is presented. A key feature of this extended flight control is its ability to avoid interrotor aerodynamics interference under specific joint configuration. Third, another extended thrust control method and a fundamental gait strategy is proposed for special terrestrial locomotion called crawling that requires all legs to be lifted at the same time. Finally, the experimental results of the flight with a complex joint motion and the repeatable crawling motion are explained, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed thrust control methods for different locomotion modes.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of xApp Conflict Mitigation Framework in O-RAN: Insights from Testbed deployment in OTIC</title>

Abstract: Conflict Mitigation (CM) in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a topic that is gaining importance as commercial O-RAN deployments become more complex. Although research on CM is already covered in terms of simulated network scenarios, it lacks validation using real-world deployment and Over The Air (OTA) Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. Our objective is to conduct the first assessment of the Conflict Mitigation Framework (CMF) for O-RAN using a real-world testbed and OTA RF transmission. This paper presents results of an experiment using a dedicated testbed built in an O-RAN Open Test and Integration Center (OTIC) to confirm the validity of one of the Conflict Resolution (CR) schemes proposed by existing research. The results show that the implemented conflict detection and resolution mechanisms allow a significant improvement in network operation stability by reducing the variability of the measured Downlink (DL) throughput by 78%.</description>

Abstract: Ramp metering, which regulates the flow entering the freeway, is one of the most effective freeway traffic control methods. This paper introduces an output-feedback adaptive approach to ramp metering that combines model predictive control (MPC) with set-membership parameter and state estimation. The set-membership estimator is based on a mixed-monotone embedding of underlying traffic dynamics. The embedding is also used as the modeling basis for MPC optimization. For a freeway stretch with unknown parameters and partial measurement on the freeway mainline, we provide sufficient conditions on the control horizon, cost functions, terminal sets of MPC, and inflow demand at the ramps such that the queue lengths in the closed-loop system remain bounded. The sufficient condition on the demand matches the necessary condition, thereby proving maximal throughput under the proposed controller. The result is strengthened to input-to-state stability when model parameters and demand are known. The stability analysis is conducted for the case of constant demand and unbounded on-ramps. The closed-loop trajectory data generated by the proposed controller is shown to facilitate finite time estimation of free-flow model parameters, i.e., free-flow speed and turning ratios. Simulation results illustrate stability of the closed-loop system under the proposed controller with time-varying demand and few mainline measurements, for which the system becomes unstable under a well-known approach from the literature. This indicates that the proposed controller renders higher throughput than the well-known approach, possibly using more computing resources.</description>

      <title>Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation networks is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic incidents and social events. Many established control strategies rely on mathematical models that struggle to cope with real-world uncertainties, leading to a significant decline in effectiveness when faced with substantial disruptions. While previous research works have dedicated efforts to improving the robustness or resilience of transportation systems against disruptions, this paper applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to better design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness and resilience as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Hence, modern transportation systems call for solutions that are antifragile. In this work, we propose a model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) scheme to control a two-region urban traffic perimeter network. The system exploits the learning capability of RL under disruptions to achieve antifragility. By monitoring the change rate and curvature of the traffic state with the RL framework, the proposed algorithm anticipates imminent disruptions. An additional term is also integrated into the RL algorithm as redundancy to improve the performance under disruption scenarios. When compared to a state-of-the-art model predictive control approach and a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, our proposed method demonstrates two antifragility-related properties: (a) gradual performance improvement under disruptions of constant magnitude; and (b) increasingly superior performance under growing disruptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal gait design for nonlinear soft robotic crawlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robots offer a frontier in robotics with enormous potential for safe human-robot interaction and agility in uncertain environments. A stepping stone towards unlocking their potential is a control theory tailored to soft robotics, including a principled framework for gait design. We analyze the problem of optimal gait design for a soft crawling body - the crawler. The crawler is an elastic body with the control signal defined as actuation forces between segments of the body. We consider the simplest such crawler: a two-segmented body with a passive mechanical connection modeling the viscoelastic body dynamics and a symmetric control force modeling actuation between the two body segments. The model accounts for the nonlinear asymmetric friction with the ground, which together with the symmetric actuation forces enable the crawler's locomotion. Using a describing-function analysis, we show that when the body is forced sinusoidally, the optimal actuator contraction frequency corresponds to the body's natural frequency when operating with only passive dynamics. We then use the framework of Optimal Periodic Control (OPC) to design optimal force cycles of arbitrary waveform and the corresponding crawling gaits. We provide a hill-climbing algorithm to solve the OPC problem numerically. Our proposed methods and results inform the design of optimal forcing and gaits for more complex and multi-segmented crawling soft bodies.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Design of Grid-tied Community Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a cost-effective microgrid design that optimally balances the economic feasibility, reliability, efficiency, and environmental impact in a grid-tied community microgrid. A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the system performance under varying load demand and renewable energy fluctuations, while an economic sensitivity assessment examines the impact of electricity prices and capital costs on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh. In addition, the operation cost is $201,473 per year with a capital investment of $1.42M, rendering it a financially viable alternative to conventional grid-dependent systems.This work can be valuable in identifying effective solutions for supplying reliable and cost-effective power to regional and remote areas.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>What Would Trojans Do? Exploiting Partial-Information Vulnerabilities in Autonomous Vehicle Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical sensors in autonomous vehicles (AVs) form an essential part of the vehicle's trusted computing base (TCB), yet they are highly susceptible to attacks. Alarmingly, Tier 1 manufacturers have already exposed vulnerabilities to attacks introducing Trojans that can stealthily alter sensor outputs. We analyze the feasible capability and safety-critical outcomes of an attack on sensing at a cyber level. To further address these threats, we design realistic attacks in AV simulators and real-world datasets under two practical constraints: attackers (1) possess only partial information and (2) are constrained by data structures that maintain sensor integrity.Examining the role of camera and LiDAR in multi-sensor AVs, we find that attacks targeting only the camera have minimal safety impact due to the sensor fusion system's strong reliance on 3D data from LiDAR. This reliance makes LiDAR-based attacks especially detrimental to safety. To mitigate the vulnerabilities, we introduce security-aware sensor fusion incorporating (1) a probabilistic data-asymmetry monitor and (2) a scalable track-to-track fusion of 3D LiDAR and monocular detections (T2T-3DLM). We demonstrate that these methods significantly diminish attack success rate.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Approach for Time and Energy Path Planning Optimization in Static Flow Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient path planning for autonomous mobile robots is a critical problem across numerous domains, where optimizing both time and energy consumption is paramount. This paper introduces a novel methodology that considers the dynamic influence of an environmental flow field and considers geometric constraints, including obstacles and forbidden zones, enriching the complexity of the planning problem. We formulate it as a multi-objective optimal control problem, propose a novel transformation called Harmonic Transformation, and apply a semi-Lagrangian scheme to solve it. The set of Pareto efficient solutions is obtained considering two distinct approaches: a deterministic method and an evolutionary-based one, both of which are designed to make use of the proposed Harmonic Transformation. Through an extensive analysis of these approaches, we demonstrate their efficacy in finding optimized paths.</description>

      <title>Wearable intelligent throat enables natural speech in stroke patients with dysarthria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>
