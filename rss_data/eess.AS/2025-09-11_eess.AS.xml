      <title>Automotive sound field reproduction using deep optimization with spatial domain constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound field reproduction with undistorted sound quality and precise spatial localization is desirable for automotive audio systems. However, the complexity of automotive cabin acoustic environment often necessitates a trade-off between sound quality and spatial accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatial Power Map Net (SPMnet), a learning-based sound field reproduction method that improves both sound quality and spatial localization in complex environments. We introduce a spatial power map (SPM) constraint, which characterizes the angular energy distribution of the reproduced field using beamforming. This constraint guides energy toward the intended direction to enhance spatial localization, and is integrated into a multi-channel equalization framework to also improve sound quality under reverberant conditions. To address the resulting non-convexity, deep optimization that use neural networks to solve optimization problems is employed for filter design. Both in situ objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our method enhances sound quality and improves spatial localization within the automotive cabin. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different audio materials and the arrival angles of the virtual sound source in the reproduced sound field, investigating the potential underlying factors affecting these results.</description>

      <title>MAPSS: Manifold-based Assessment of Perceptual Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective assessment of source-separation systems still mismatches subjective human perception, especially when leakage and self-distortion interact. We introduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first pair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive method begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each reference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their respective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a pre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are aggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns Euclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded waveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each output to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions embeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis distance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed clusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular, operating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive, for both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic, high-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish, and music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest linear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14 competitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music. We observe, at worst, an error radius of 1.39% and a probabilistic 95% CI of 12.21% for these coefficients, which improves reliable and informed evaluation. Using mutual information, the measures complement each other most as their values decrease, suggesting they are jointly more informative as system performance degrades.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Adversarial Attack Detection: from Datasets to Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems can be used for voice-enabled applications for identity verification. However, recent studies have exposed these systems' vulnerabilities to both over-the-line (OTL) and over-the-air (OTA) adversarial attacks. Although various detection methods have been proposed to counter these threats, they have not been thoroughly tested due to the lack of a comprehensive data set. To address this gap, we developed the AdvSV 2.0 dataset, which contains 628k samples with a total duration of 800 hours. This dataset incorporates classical adversarial attack algorithms, ASV systems, and encompasses both OTL and OTA scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method based on a Neural Replay Simulator (NRS), which enhances the potency of adversarial OTA attacks, thereby presenting a greater threat to ASV systems. To defend against these attacks, we propose CODA-OCC, a contrastive learning approach within the one-class classification framework. Experimental results show that CODA-OCC achieves an EER of 11.2% and an AUC of 0.95 on the AdvSV 2.0 dataset, outperforming several state-of-the-art detection methods.</description>

      <title>Listening for "You": Enhancing Speech Image Retrieval via Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image retrieval using spoken language cues has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal perception, yet leveraging speech in multi-speaker scenarios remains challenging. We propose a novel Target Speaker Speech-Image Retrieval task and a framework that learns the relationship between images and multi-speaker speech signals in the presence of a target speaker. Our method integrates pre-trained self-supervised audio encoders with vision models via target speaker-aware contrastive learning, conditioned on a Target Speaker Extraction and Retrieval module. This enables the system to extract spoken commands from the target speaker and align them with corresponding images. Experiments on SpokenCOCO2Mix and SpokenCOCO3Mix show that TSRE significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 36.3% and 29.9% Recall@1 in 2 and 3 speaker scenarios, respectively - substantial improvements over single speaker baselines and state-of-the-art models. Our approach demonstrates potential for real-world deployment in assistive robotics and multimodal interaction systems.</description>

      <title>Short-term cognitive fatigue of spatial selective attention after face-to-face conversations in virtual noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial selective attention is an important asset for communication in cocktail party situations but may be compromised by short-term cognitive fatigue. Here we tested whether an effortful conversation in a highly ecological setting depletes task performance in an auditory spatial selective attention task. Young participants with normal hearing performed the task before and after (1) having a real dyadic face-to-face conversation on a free topic in a virtual reverberant room with simulated interfering conversations and background babble noise at 72 dB SPL for 30 minutes, (2) passively listening to the interfering conversations and babble noise, or (3) having the conversation in quiet. Self-reported perceived effort and fatigue increased after conversations in noise and passive listening relative to the reports after conversations in quiet. In contrast to our expectations, response times in the attention task decreased, rather than increased, after conversation in noise and accuracy did not change systematically in any of the conditions on the group level. Unexpectedly, we observed strong training effects between the individual sessions in our within-subject design even after one hour of training on a different day.</description>

      <title>Acoustic to Articulatory Speech Inversion for Children with Velopharyngeal Insufficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional clinical approaches for assessing nasality, such as nasopharyngoscopy and nasometry, involve unpleasant experiences and are problematic for children. Speech Inversion (SI), a noninvasive technique, offers a promising alternative for estimating articulatory movement without the need for physical instrumentation. In this study, an SI system trained on nasalance data from healthy adults is augmented with source information from electroglottography and acoustically derived F0, periodic and aperiodic energy estimates as proxies for glottal control. This model achieves 16.92% relative improvement in Pearson Product-Moment Correlation (PPMC) compared to a previous SI system for nasalance estimation. To adapt the SI system for nasalance estimation in children with Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI), the model initially trained on adult speech was fine-tuned using children with VPI data, yielding an 7.90% relative improvement in PPMC compared to its performance before fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Region-Specific Audio Tagging for Spatial Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio tagging aims to label sound events appearing in an audio recording. In this paper, we propose region-specific audio tagging, a new task which labels sound events in a given region for spatial audio recorded by a microphone array. The region can be specified as an angular space or a distance from the microphone. We first study the performance of different combinations of spectral, spatial, and position features. Then we extend state-of-the-art audio tagging systems such as pre-trained audio neural networks (PANNs) and audio spectrogram transformer (AST) to the proposed region-specific audio tagging task. Experimental results on both the simulated and the real datasets show the feasibility of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further experiments show that incorporating the directional features is beneficial for omnidirectional tagging.</description>

      <title>Binaural Target Speaker Extraction using HRTFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to imitate the human ability to selectively attend to a single speaker, even in the presence of multiple simultaneous talkers. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach for binaural target speaker extraction that leverages the listener's Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) to isolate the desired speaker. Notably, our method does not rely on speaker embeddings, making it speaker-independent and enabling strong generalization across multiple speech datasets and languages. We employ a fully complex-valued neural network that operates directly on the complex-valued Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) of the mixed audio signals, and compare it to a Real-Imaginary (RI)-based neural network, demonstrating the advantages of the former. We first evaluate the method in an anechoic, noise-free scenario, achieving excellent extraction performance while preserving the binaural cues of the target signal. We then extend the evaluation to reverberant conditions. Our method proves robust, maintaining speech clarity and source directionality while simultaneously reducing reverberation. A comparative analysis with existing binaural Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) methods demonstrates that our approach attains performance on par with competing techniques in terms of noise reduction and perceptual quality, while offering a clear advantage in preserving binaural cues.Demo-page: https://bi-ctse-hrtf.github.io</description>

      <title>MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder: Towards a Speech Foundation Model for Singapore and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report describes the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder, a foundation model designed to support a wide range of downstream speech applications. Developed as part of Singapore's National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme, the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder is tailored to address the speech processing needs in Singapore and the surrounding Southeast Asian region. The model currently supports mainly English, including the variety spoken in Singapore. We are actively expanding our datasets to gradually cover other languages in subsequent releases. The MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder was pre-trained from scratch on 200,000 hours of unlabelled speech data using a self-supervised learning approach based on masked language modelling. We describe our training procedure and hyperparameter tuning experiments in detail below. Our evaluation demonstrates improvements to spontaneous and Singapore speech benchmarks for speech recognition, while remaining competitive to other state-of-the-art speech encoders across ten other speech tasks. We commit to releasing our model, supporting broader research endeavours, both in Singapore and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Novel Data Augmentation Approach for Automatic Speaking Assessment on Opinion Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.</description>

      <title>The NTNU System at the S&amp;I Challenge 2025 SLA Open Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4 multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak &amp; Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked, and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Conformers for Audio Fingerprinting and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformers have shown great results in speech processing due to their ability to capture both local and global interactions. In this work, we utilize a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to train conformer-based encoders that are capable of generating unique embeddings for small segments of audio, generalizing well to previously unseen data. We achieve state-of-the-art results for audio retrieval tasks while using only 3 seconds of audio to generate embeddings. Our models are almost completely immune to temporal misalignments and achieve state-of-the-art results in cases of other audio distortions such as noise, reverb or extreme temporal stretching. Code and models are made publicly available and the results are easy to reproduce as we train and test using popular and freely available datasets of different sizes.</description>

      <title>AU-Harness: An Open-Source Toolkit for Holistic Evaluation of Audio LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce AU-Harness, an efficient and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex instruction following downstream tasks. AU-Harness provides both practical evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM development.</description>

      <title>Behind the Scenes: Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-adapted Whisper for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition (SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment, backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable adaptation strategies in large speech models.
