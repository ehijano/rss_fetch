      <title>X-Sifter: detecting transients in X-ray data using the optimal Poisson matched filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-sifter, a software package designed for near-optimal detection of sources in X-ray images and other forms of photon images in the Poisson-noise regime. The code is based on the Poisson-noise-matched filter (Ofek &amp; Zackay), which provides an efficient method for calculating the delta log-likelihood function for source detection. The software accounts for several complexities inherent in real data, including variations in both the instrumental Point Spread Function (PSF) and background across the detector and as a function of energy. We validate the pipeline using real data with simulated source injections, as well as actual Chandra images. A comparison between the sources detected by our pipeline and those in the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) suggests an approximate ~30% increase in the number of detected (real) sources. Near the detection limit, the reported S/N of our pipeline is approximately 1.3x higher than that of the CSC. This corresponds to a factor of 1.8 increase in survey speed.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of the Virtual Observatory to Underserved Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a global ecosystem of interoperating services that connect worldwide data archives. The VO is implemented in all major astronomy archives through common interfaces developed by the 22 members of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). It was founded in 2002, and the newest members, the SKA Observatory and the Kazakhstan Virtual Observatory, joined in 2022. The VO offers access to data on FAIR principles and from its inception has supported Open Science. The VO acts as a democratizing influence in astronomy: it provides equal access to worldwide public data sets to underserved communities as well as to large data centers, and it enables international participation in scientific research and education. Thus, astronomers from many different communities are positioned to participate in the big science questions emerging in astronomy in the 2020s, such as interpreting transient sources that will be measured in forthcoming missions such as Rubin. In addition, the IVOA has signed an MoU with the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD). Under this MoU, IVOA members participated in "Astronomy from Archival Data," which involved educational activities for undergraduate and post-graduate students organized by Dr. Priya Hasan. The IVOA plans to participate in future such educational events. The presentation describes how new communities may participate in Virtual Observatory science and educational activities, including practices for developing VO-compliant data centers and archives and education and training for developers and end users.</description>

      <title>Call to Protect the Dark and Quiet Sky from Harmful Interference by Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of satellite constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) enhances global communications and Earth observation, and support of space commerce is a high priority of many governments. At the same time, the proliferation of satellites in LEO has negative effects on astronomical observations and research, and the preservation of the dark and quiet sky. These satellite constellations reflect sunlight onto optical telescopes, and their radio emission impacts radio observatories, jeopardising our access to essential scientific discoveries through astronomy. The changing visual appearance of the sky also impacts our cultural heritage and environment. Both ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes in LEO are affected, and there are no places on Earth that can escape the effects of satellite constellations given their global nature. The minimally disturbed dark and radio-quiet sky is crucial for conducting fundamental research in astronomy and important public services such as planetary defence, technology development, and high-precision geolocation. Some aspects of satellite deployment and operation are regulated by States and intergovernmental organisations. While regulatory agencies in some States have started to require operators to coordinate with their national astronomy agencies over impacts, mitigation of the impact of space objects on astronomical activities is not sufficiently regulated. To address this issue, the CPS urges States and the international community to take steps to protect the dark and quiet sky as specified in this paper.</description>

      <title>Fast GPU-Powered and Auto-Differentiable Forward Modeling of IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters. RUBIX is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/ufuk-cakir/rubix.</description>

      <title>SuperCode: Sustainability PER AI-driven CO-DEsign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, data-intensive scientific applications require vast amounts of compute resources to deliver world-leading science. The climate emergency has made it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific discovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be much more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot reach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven co-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), to effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We describe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy applications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper is a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it here in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to disseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An additional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners and use-cases to join the project.</description>

      <title>CCSNscore: A multi-input deep learning tool for classification of core-collapse supernovae using SED-Machine spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic dynamic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort, and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra obtained with the SED-Machine IFU spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers which are run in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs, to supplement spectra with g- and r-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra ("gold" test set), CCSNscore is ~94% accurate (correct classifications) in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With the help of light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score &gt;= 0.8 and score-error &lt; 0.05), with ~98% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled small-satellite polarisation imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06132v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarisation imaging is used to distinguish objects and surface characteristics that are otherwise not visible with black-and-white or colour imaging. Full-Stokes polarisation imaging allows complex image processing like water glint filtering, which is particularly useful for remote Earth observations. The relatively low cost of small-satellites makes their use in remote sensing more accessible. However, their size and weight limitations cannot accommodate the bulky conventional optics needed for full-Stokes polarisation imaging. We present the modelling of an ultra-thin topology-optimised diffractive metasurface that encodes polarisation states in five different diffraction orders. Positioning the metasurface in a telescope's pupil plane allows the diffraction orders to be imaged onto a single detector, resulting in the capability to perform single-shot full-Stokes polarisation imaging of the Earth's surface. The five rectangular image swaths are designed to use the full width of the camera, and then each successive frame can be stitched together as the satellite moves over the Earth's surface, restoring the full field of view achievable with any chosen camera without comprising the on-ground resolution. Each set of four out of the five orders enables the reconstruction of the full polarisation state, and their simultaneous reconstructions allow for error monitoring. The lightweight design and compact footprint of the polarisation imaging optical system achievable with a metasurface is a novel approach to increase the functionality of small satellites while working within their weight and volume constraints.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Conservative-to-Primitive Conversion in Hybrid Piecewise Polytropic and Tabulated Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel AI-based approach to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding methods are computationally intensive, particularly in large-scale simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal loss in accuracy. The NNC2PS model achieves $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ errors of $4.54 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.44 \times 10^{-6}$, respectively, with the NNC2PL model yielding even lower error values. TensorRT optimization ensures high accuracy, with FP16 quantization offering 7x faster performance than traditional root-finding methods. Our AI models outperform conventional CPU solvers, demonstrating enhanced inference times, particularly for large datasets. We release the scientific software developed for this work, enabling the validation and extension of our findings. These results highlight the potential of AI, combined with GPU optimization, to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IERS C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series contains the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate Yp in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses possible ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: deterministic astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and statistical data-driven model based on the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the Yp errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>

      <title>PSR J1922+37: a 1.9-second pulsar discovered in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 300 pulsars have been discovered in Galactic globular clusters; however, none have been found in open clusters. Here we present results from 20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first discovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance of 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, respectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is likely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance is $4.19\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37 will be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future observations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss the general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.</description>

      <title>RatanSunPy: A robust preprocessing pipeline for RATAN-600 solar radio observations data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of observational technologies and software for processing and visualizing spectro-polarimetric microwave data obtained with the RATAN-600 radio telescope opens new opportunities for studying the physical characteristics of solar plasma at the levels of the chromosphere and corona. These levels remain some difficult to detect in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges. The development of such methods allows for more precise investigation of the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the processes occurring in these layers. The obtained data also can be utilized for diagnosing solar plasma and forecasting solar activity. However, using RATAN-600 data requires extensive data processing and familiarity with the RATAN-600. This paper introduces RatanSunPy, an open-source Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 solar complex. The package offers comprehensive data processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources, identifying them with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) active regions, and further determining parameters for local sources and active regions. By streamlining data processing workflows, RatanSunPy enables researchers to investigate the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere more efficiently, contributing to advancements in solar physics and space weather forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</description>

      <title>GRANDlib: A simulation pipeline for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated multi-source global fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called ``Erebor,'' designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. The Erebor algorithm includes three unique and very useful contributions: GPU acceleration for enhanced computational efficiency; ensemble MCMC sampling with multiple MCMC walkers per temperature for better mixing and parallelized sample creation; and special online updates to reversible-jump (or trans-dimensional) sampling distributions to ensure sampler mixing and accurate initial estimates for detectable sources in the data. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Morning-to-Evening Limb Asymmetry on the Cool Low-Density Exoplanet WASP-107b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atmospheric properties of hot exoplanets are expected to be different between the morning and the evening limb due to global atmospheric circulation. Ground-based observations at high spectral resolution have detected this limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot (&gt;2000 K) exoplanets, but the prevalence of the phenomenon in the broader exoplanetary population remains unexplored. Here we use JWST/NIRCam transmission spectra between 2.5 and 4.0 $\mu$m to find evidence of limb asymmetry on exoplanet WASP-107 b. With its equilibrium temperature of 770 K and low density of 0.126 gm c$^{-3}$, WASP-107 b probes a very different regime compared to ultra-hot giant planets and was not expected to exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity according to atmospheric models. We infer instead a morning-evening temperature difference on the order of 100 K with a hotter evening limb. Further observations on other cooler exoplanets are needed to determine whether WASP-107 b is an outlier or the models underestimate the presence of limb asymmetry in exoplanets.</description>
