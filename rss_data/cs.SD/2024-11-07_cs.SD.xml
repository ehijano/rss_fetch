      <title>Mobile Recording Device Recognition Based Cross-Scale and Multi-Level Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modeling approach that employs multi-level global processing, encompassing both short-term frame-level and long-term sample-level feature scales. In the initial stage of shallow feature extraction, various scales are employed to extract multi-level features, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and pre-Fbank log energy spectrum. The construction of the identification network model involves considering the input two-dimensional temporal features from both frame and sample levels. Specifically, the model initially employs one-dimensional convolution-based Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) to fuse spatiotemporal information and extract short-term frame-level features. Subsequently, bidirectional long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is utilized to learn long-term sample-level sequential representations. The transformer encoder then performs cross-scale, multi-level processing on global frame-level and sample-level features, facilitating deep feature representation and fusion at both levels. Finally, recognition results are obtained through Softmax. Our method achieves an impressive 99.6% recognition accuracy on the CCNU_Mobile dataset, exhibiting a notable improvement of 2% to 12% compared to the baseline system. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the transferability of our model, achieving an 87.9% accuracy in a classification task on a new dataset.</description>

      <title>MOS-Bench: Benchmarking Generalization Abilities of Subjective Speech Quality Assessment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective speech quality assessment (SSQA) is critical for evaluating speech samples as perceived by human listeners. While model-based SSQA has enjoyed great success thanks to the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), generalization remains a key challenge, especially for unseen, out-of-domain data. To benchmark the generalization abilities of SSQA models, we present MOS-Bench, a diverse collection of datasets. In addition, we also introduce SHEET, an open-source toolkit containing complete recipes to conduct SSQA experiments. We provided benchmark results for MOS-Bench, and we also explored multi-dataset training to enhance generalization. Additionally, we proposed a new performance metric, best score difference/ratio, and used latent space visualizations to explain model behavior, offering valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case of Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of SLAM-ASR: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Way Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that training a linear connector between speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLMs) enables this architecture to achieve strong ASR capabilities. Despite the impressive results, it remains unclear whether these simple approaches are robust enough across different scenarios and speech conditions, such as domain shifts and different speech perturbations. In this paper, we address these questions by conducting various ablation experiments using a recent and widely adopted approach called SLAM-ASR. We present novel empirical findings that offer insights on how to effectively utilize the SLAM-ASR architecture across a wide range of settings. Our main findings indicate that the SLAM-ASR exhibits poor performance in cross-domain evaluation settings. Additionally, speech perturbations within in-domain data, such as changes in speed or the presence of additive noise, can significantly impact performance. Our findings offer critical insights for fine-tuning and configuring robust LLM-based ASR models, tailored to different data characteristics and computational resources.</description>

      <title>AudioBench: A Universal Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AudioBench, a universal benchmark designed to evaluate Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs). It encompasses 8 distinct tasks and 26 datasets, among which, 7 are newly proposed datasets. The evaluation targets three main aspects: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice understanding (paralinguistic). Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks. We outline the research outlook for AudioLLMs and anticipate that our open-sourced evaluation toolkit, data, and leaderboard will offer a robust testbed for future model developments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Audio: Advancing Multi-Audio Processing in Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Framework for Simultaneous Segmentation, Classification, and Caller Identification of Marmoset Vocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marmoset, a highly vocalized primate, has become a popular animal model for studying social-communicative behavior and its underlying mechanism comparing with human infant linguistic developments. In the study of vocal communication, it is vital to know the caller identities, call contents, and vocal exchanges. Previous work of a CNN has achieved a joint model for call segmentation, classification, and caller identification for marmoset vocalizations. However, the CNN has limitations in modeling long-range acoustic patterns; the Transformer architecture that has been shown to outperform CNNs, utilizes the self-attention mechanism that efficiently segregates information parallelly over long distances and captures the global structure of marmoset vocalization. We propose using the Transformer to jointly segment and classify the marmoset calls and identify the callers for each vocalization.</description>

      <title>Speaker Emotion Recognition: Leveraging Self-Supervised Models for Feature Extraction Using Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. Identifying emotion from speech is a nontrivial task due to the ambiguous definition of emotion itself. Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for understanding human emotional behavior. The SER task is challenging due to the variety of speakers, background noise, complexity of emotions, and speaking styles. It has many applications in education, healthcare, customer service, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Previously, conventional machine learning methods such as SVM, HMM, and KNN have been used for the SER task. In recent years, deep learning methods have become popular, with convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks being used for SER tasks. The input of these methods is mostly spectrograms and hand-crafted features. In this work, we study the use of self-supervised transformer-based models, Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT, to determine the emotion of speakers from their voice. The models automatically extract features from raw audio signals, which are then used for the classification task. The proposed solution is evaluated on reputable datasets, including RAVDESS, SHEMO, SAVEE, AESDD, and Emo-DB. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method on different datasets. Moreover, the model has been used for real-world applications like call center conversations, and the results demonstrate that the model accurately predicts emotions.</description>

      <title>Robustifying automatic speech recognition by extracting slowly varying features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust.</description>

      <title>Universal Sound Separation with Self-Supervised Audio Masked Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal sound separation (USS) is a task of separating mixtures of arbitrary sound sources. Typically, universal separation models are trained from scratch in a supervised manner, using labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging deep learning approach that leverages unlabeled data to obtain task-agnostic representations, which can benefit many downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose integrating a self-supervised pre-trained model, namely the audio masked autoencoder (A-MAE), into a universal sound separation system to enhance its separation performance. We employ two strategies to utilize SSL embeddings: freezing or updating the parameters of A-MAE during fine-tuning. The SSL embeddings are concatenated with the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to serve as input features for the separation model. We evaluate our methods on the AudioSet dataset, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed methods successfully enhance the separation performance of a state-of-the-art ResUNet-based USS model.</description>

      <title>Reassessing Noise Augmentation Methods in the Context of Adversarial Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate if noise-augmented training can concurrently improve adversarial robustness in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We conduct a comparative analysis of the adversarial robustness of four different state-of-the-art ASR architectures, where each of the ASR architectures is trained under three different augmentation conditions: one subject to background noise, speed variations, and reverberations, another subject to speed variations only, and a third without any form of data augmentation. The results demonstrate that noise augmentation not only improves model performance on noisy speech but also the model's robustness to adversarial attacks.</description>
