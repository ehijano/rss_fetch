      <title>A Plasma Torus Around a Young Low-Mass Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of red dwarfs younger than 100 million years show structured, periodic optical light curves suggestive of transiting opaque material that corotates with the star. However, the composition, origin, and even the existence of this material are uncertain. The main alternative hypothesis is that these complex periodic variables (CPVs) are explained by complex distributions of bright or dark regions on the stellar surfaces. Here, we present time-series spectroscopy and photometry of a rapidly-rotating ($P$=3.9 hr) CPV, TIC 141146667. The spectra show sinusoidal time-varying H$\alpha$ emission at twice to four times the star's equatorial velocity, providing direct evidence for cool ($\lesssim$10$^4$ K) plasma clumps trapped in corotation around a CPV. These data support the idea that young, rapidly-rotating M dwarfs can sustain warped tori of cool plasma, similar to other rapidly-rotating magnetic stars. Outstanding questions include whether dust clumps in these plasma tori explain CPV light curves, and whether the tori originate from the star or are fed by external sources. Rough estimates suggest $\gtrsim$10% of M dwarfs host similar structures during their early lives.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity. XIII. Putting the bi-stability jump to the test in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate the theoretical bi-stability jump, which predicts an increase in mass-loss rates below 21 kK. We further aim to constrain the photospheric and wind parameters of a sample of 16 LMC late-O and B supergiants. We utilise the 1D, non-LTE radiative transfer model CMFGEN in a grid-based approach and subsequent fine-tuned spectroscopic fitting procedure to determine the stellar and wind parameters of each star. We apply this method to ultra-violet data from the ULLYSES programme and complementary optical data from the XShootU collaboration. We also utilise evolutionary models to obtain the evolutionary masses and compare them to our derived spectroscopic masses. We derive physical parameters and wind properties of 16 late-O and B supergiants that span a wide $T_{eff}$ range of 12-30 kK, surface gravity range $\log{g/cm~s^{-2}}$ of 1.8-3.1, and a mass-loss rate range of $10^{-7.6}-10^{-5.7}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$. We also compare our results to previous studies spectroscopic studies of LMC OB stars. We find that our derived photospheric and wind properties are consistent with multiple previous studies. For most of our sample, we find that the evolutionary masses and spectroscopic masses are consistent. Our results do not reproduce a bi-stability jump in any temperature range, but rather a monotonic decrease in mass-loss rate at lower temperatures. We obtain a terminal wind velocity-effective temperature relation for LMC supergiants. We find that our derived mass-loss rates do not agree with predictions from any of the numerical recipes. This is also the case for the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity $v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$, and we derive a $v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$-$T_{eff}$ relation. We find that wind properties are metallicity dependent from a comparison with a previous SMC study, and we obtain a new modified wind momentum-luminosity relation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Eclipsing Binary System IY Aur: First Photometric Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binary systems play a vital role in astrophysics, as they provide a direct means of measuring fundamental stellar parameters. By combining high-precision space-based observations with ground-based multicolor photometric data, these parameters can be determined with greater accuracy. In this study, we present the first photometric analysis of the IY Aur eclipsing binary system, using a combination of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve and new UBVRI CCD observations obtained with the 60 cm robotic telescope (T60) at the TUBITAK National Observatory. Through detailed photometric modeling, the masses and radii of the system's primary and secondary components were determined as $M_{1}=6.51\pm 0.81\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{2}=5.39\pm 0.87\,M_{\odot}$, and $R_{1}=4.15\pm 0.20\,R_{\odot}$, $R_{2}=6.88\pm 0.33\,R_{\odot}$, respectively. The logarithmic values of luminosity and surface gravity were calculated as $\log L_{1}=3.14\pm 0.20\,L_{\odot}$ and $\log g_{1}=4.01\pm 0.02$ cgs for the primary component, and $\log L_{2}=2.50 \pm 0.22\,L_{\odot}$ and $\log g_{2}=3.49\pm 0.03$ cgs for the secondary component. Furthermore, the distance to IY Aur was estimated as $d=1690\pm237$ pc.</description>

      <title>New Symbiotic Stars from LAMOST DR10 Spectra and Multi-band Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic star (SySt) is long-period interacting binary system, typically consisting of a white dwarf and a red giant surrounded by a nebula. These systems are natural astrophysical laboratories for investigating binary star evolution. In this paper, we identified nine SySts from the LAMOST DR10 low-resolution spectra survey, seven of which were previously known, while two are newly identified. Initially, we selected LAMOST spectra exhibiting typical SySt emission lines (e.g., $\rm H_{\alpha}, ~H_{\beta}, ~H_{\gamma}, ~and ~He II$). Subsequently, we utilized the distribution of known SySts on the HR diagram to select SySt candidates, and visually inspected their spectra. Ultimately, we classified all nine as S-type SySts using the $J - H$ vs. $H - K$ diagram. Additionally, based on multi-band photometric data from GALEX, Gaia, 2MASS, ALLWISE, and several X-ray catalogs, we found 12 accreting-only SySt (acc-SySt) candidates, characterized by concurrent ultraviolet and infrared excess and accretion process. Furthermore, we estimated the white dwarf temperatures by fitting their observed SEDs using a combination of Kurucz stellar atmosphere model and Koester white dwarf model. We compared the accretion rates of acc-SySt candidates and confirmed SySts, and found they have similar accretion rate distribution, providing evidence that these acc-SySt candidates constitute bona fide SySts.</description>

      <title>Entropy proxy inversions as tracers of the evolution of physical conditions at the base of the solar convective envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is an important calibrator for the theory of stellar structure and evolution. However, the accuracy of our solar evolution models is tightly linked to the physical ingredients that enter their computations. This include, amongst other, the equation of state, the opacities, the transport of chemicals and the modelling of turbulent convection. Deriving model-independent probes of these ingredients is therefore crucial to further test the quality of these ingredients and potentially reveal their shortcomings using observational data. We aim at providing additional constraints on the thermodynamical properties of the solar plasma at the base of the solar convective zone using a revised helioseismic indicator mimicking the properties of the specific entropy in the envelope. We derive a revised entropy proxy for the solar convective envelope, directly accessible using helioseismic structure inversions. We then use solar evolutionary models with various modifications of input physics to study the properties of proxy of the entropy in the convective envelope. We find that the entropy proxy for the solar convective envelope allows to invalidate adiabatic overshooting as a solution to the solar modelling problem and strongly points towards the need for revised opacities. Our results show that this new indicator is a strong diagnostic of the overall evolution of the thermodynamical conditions at the base of the convective zone. The new entropy proxy indicator allows for a more accurate characterisation of the conditions at the base of the solar convective zone. While it already allows to rule out overshooting as a solution to the solar modelling problem, its sensitivity to the shape of the opacity modification and the evolution of the properties at the base of the convective zone makes it a powerful helioseismic diagnostic for solar models.</description>

      <title>Apparent motion of penumbral grains in a sunspot simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The bright heads of penumbral filaments, penumbral grains (PGs), are manifestations of hot plasma flows rising to the surface. They are observed to move horizontally toward the sunspot umbra or away from it. Recent analyses of observations indicate that the direction of this motion is related to the inclination of the surrounding magnetic field. Aims. The penumbra of a sunspot simulated by the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code MURaM is analysed to get typical physical conditions in PGs, compare them to those in the surroundings, describe their spatial distribution, and study their evolution. Methods. We use time series of images that map intensity, temperature, magnetic field vector, and velocity vector in horizontal slices at the visible surface, in subsurface layers, and in vertical cuts through the simulation box to track PGs and compare, statistically and in individual cases, the physical quantities inside them with those in the surroundings. Results. The statistical analysis of simulation results provides average values of temperature, magnetic field strength and inclination, vertical velocity, and their changes with radial distance from the spot centre. We find a subtle difference between simulated PGs with opposite directions of motions when comparing the magnetic field inclinations inside and outside the PGs. The case studies, documented by movies, show that the differences of inclinations and the direction of motions may change during the lifetime of some PGs and that the turbulence in the surface layers introduces some randomness in the apparent motions of PGs.</description>

      <title>A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.</description>

      <title>What Causes Errors in Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Modeling at L1 ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous ambient solar wind (SW) validation studies have reported on discrepancies between modeled and observed SW conditions at L1. They indicated that a major source of discrepancies stems from how we model the solar corona. Thus, enhancing predictive capabilities demands a thorough examination of coronal modeling. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been a workhorse model that provides the near-Sun SW conditions. An important component of it is the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. This study analyzes 15 different Carrington Rotations(CRs), and presents detailed analysis of CR 2052 to identify WSA model settings that lead to successful and erroneous SW predictions at Earth. For the events studied, we show that increasing the models grid resolution improves the open-close boundary identification. This results in better predicting the onset and duration of high-speed streams (HSSs). In addition, we find an optimized source surface height (R$_{ss}$) (lying between 1.8-3.1 R$_{\odot}$) further enhances HSS prediction accuracy for the studied events. A detailed analysis shows that changes in R$_{ss}$, (a) changes the Great Circle Angular Distance (GCAD) maps (at the solar surface) of the associated coronal holes and (b) changes the foot-point locations of the magnetic connectivities to the sub-Earth locations. These factors change the near-Sun SW speed, that eventually leads to uncertainties in speeds near Earth. We also investigate the usefulness of coronal hole observations in constraining R$_{ss}$ and SW solutions at Earth, and highlight their underutilized value in guiding the selection of magnetic maps for improved ambient solar wind modeling at L1.</description>

      <title>ABYSS III: Observing accretion activity in young stars through empirical veiling measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar accretion plays an important role in the early stages of stellar evolution, particularly in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). Accretion of a CTTS can be related to different physical parameters such as effective temperature (T$_{\text{eff}}$), age, abundance of hydrogen, etc. We can infer how accretion works by examining it across different wavelength regions. Accretion can be traced using veiling, a parameter that measures how excess emission from accretion affects the photospheric spectrum of CTTS. In this study, we selected a sample of CTTSs, Weak-line T Tauri Stars (WTTSs), and field stars, observed as a part of the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper using the BOSS spectrograph. We measured veiling for CTTSs through comparing them to theoretical spectra. Next, we assessed the effect of veiling on different stellar properties, including wavelength, H$\alpha$ emission, effective temperature, and age. We investigated how veiling changes with these parameters and what the physical reasons behind the changes can be. Finally, we evaluated how our findings align with existing accretion shock models. This study highlights veiling as a critical diagnostic tool for understanding accretion in young stars.</description>

      <title>Noise in Maps of the Sun at Radio Wavelengths I: Theoretical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is a powerful source of radio emissions, so much so that, unlike most celestial sources, this emission can dominate the system noise of radio telescopes. We outline the theory of noise in maps formed by Fourier synthesis techniques at radio wavelengths, with a focus on self-noise: that is, noise due to the source itself. As a means of developing intuition we consider noise for the case of a single dish, a two-element interferometer, and an n-element array for simple limiting cases. We then turn to the question of the distribution of noise on a map of an arbitrary source observed at radio wavelengths by an n-element interferometric array. We consider the implications of self-noise for observations of the Sun in a companion paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise in images of strong celestial sources at radio wavelengths using Fourier synthesis arrays can be dominated by the source itself, so-called self-noise. We outlined the theory of self-noise for strong sources in a companion paper. Here we consider the case of noise in maps of radio emission from the Sun which, as we show, is always dominated by self noise. We consider several classes of science use cases for current and planned arrays designed to observe the Sun in order to understand limitations imposed by self-noise. We focus on instruments operating at decimeter and centimeter wavelengths but the results are applicable to other wavelength regimes.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit misalignment and residual eccentricity are evidence that neutron star-black hole mergers form through triple star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}&gt;0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}&lt;0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} &gt; 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}&gt;10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.</description>

Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-parametric Gaussian process models to investigate the effective inspiral spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of primary black hole mass in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3). Our analysis reveals a transition in the population at a primary mass of $46^{+7}_{-5}\,M_\odot$. Beyond this mass, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution broadens, becomes consistent with being symmetric around zero, and has a median of $-0.03^{+0.36}_{-0.59}$ (90\% credibility). These results are consistent with the presence of a pair-instability mass gap that is repopulated by black holes that are the remnant of a previous merger, formed in dense star clusters. However, asymmetric distributions skewed toward positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are not excluded by current data. Below the inferred transition mass, we constrain the fraction of second-generation black holes to be $\lesssim 10\%$. These results provide model-independent support for a high-mass and high-spin population of black holes in the data, consistent with earlier work using parametric models. Imminent gravitational-wave data releases will be essential to sharpen constraints on spin symmetry and clarify the origin of the black holes.</description>

      <title>JWST Coronagraphic Images of 14 Her c: a Cold Giant Planet in a Dynamically Hot, Multi-planet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most observed multi-planet systems are coplanar, in a dynamically "cold" configuration of concentric orbits like our own Solar System. With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we have detected 14 Her c, the first mature and cold exoplanet directly imaged in a dynamically "hot", multi-planet system. With large eccentricities and a nonzero mutual inclination, the present-day architecture of this system points to a turbulent past and ongoing angular momentum exchange between the planetary orbits of 14 Her b and c. The temperature of 14 Her c rivals both the coldest imaged exoplanet and the coldest known brown dwarf. Moreover, its photometry at 4.4 mu is consistent with the presence of carbon disequilibrium chemistry and water ice clouds in its atmosphere. 14 Her c presents a unique laboratory to study giant planet formation, dynamical evolution of multi-planet system architectures, and atmospheric composition and dynamics in extremely cold worlds.</description>

      <title>A Metallicity Catalog of Very Metal-poor Main-sequence Turn-off and Red Giant Stars from LAMOST DR10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 8,440 candidate very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0) main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and red giant stars in the Milky Way, identified from low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR10. More than 7,000 of these candidates are brighter than G ~ 16, making them excellent targets for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with 4-10 meter-class telescopes. Unlike most previous studies, we employed an empirical calibration to estimate metallicities from the equivalent widths (EWs) of the Calcium Triplet (CaT) lines, taking advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the red arm of LAMOST spectra. We further refined this calibration to improve its reliability for more distant stars. This method enables robust identification of VMP candidates with metallicities as low as [Fe/H] = -4.0 among both MSTO and red giant stars. Comparisons with metal-poor samples from other spectroscopic surveys and high-resolution follow-up observations confirm the accuracy of our estimates, showing a typical median offset of ~0.1 dex and a standard deviation of ~0.2 dex.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Virtual Research Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses Histogram Based Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: "Real" and "Galactic". The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most "Real" and "Extra-galactic" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light curve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity &lt;0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Star Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the G8 subgiant beta Aquilae with SONG-Tenerife, SONG-Australia and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present time-series radial velocities of the G8 subgiant star beta Aql obtained in 2022 and 2023 using SONG-Tenerife and, for the first time, SONG-Australia. We also analyse a sector of TESS photometry that overlapped with the 2022 SONG data. The resulting power spectrum clearly shows solar-like oscillations centred at 430 muHz. The TESS light curve shows the oscillations at lower signal-to-noise, reflecting the fact that photometric measurements are much more affected by the granulation background than are radial velocities. The simultaneous observations in velocity and photometry represent the best such measurements for any star apart from the Sun. They allowed us to measure the ratio between the bolometric photometric amplitude and the velocity amplitude to be 26.6 +/- 3.1 ppm/(m/s). We measured this ratio for the Sun from published SOHO data to be 19.5 +/- 0.7 ppm/(m/s) and, after accounting for the difference in effective temperatures of and the Sun, these values align with expectations. In both the Sun and beta Aql, the photometry-to-velocity ratio appears to be a function of frequency. We also measured the phase shift of the oscillations in beta Aql between SONG and TESS to be -113 +/- 7 deg, which agrees with the value for the Sun and also with a 3-D simulation of a star with similar properties to beta Aql. Importantly for exoplanet searches, we argue that simultaneous photometry can be used to predict the contribution of oscillations to radial velocities. We measured frequencies for 22 oscillation modes in beta Aql and carried out asteroseismic modelling, yielding an excellent fit to the frequencies. We derived accurate values for the mass and age, and were able to place quite strong constraints on the mixing-length parameter. Finally, we show that the oscillation properties of beta Aql are very similar to stars in the open cluster M67.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as Seen by Classical Cepheids I: Distances Based on Mid-infrared Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are the archetype of the standard candle, thanks to the period-luminosity relation which allows to measure their intrinsic brightness. They are also relatively young and bright, potentially making them excellent tracers of the young stellar population that is responsible for shaping the visible aspect of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. However, being observers embedded in the dusty interstellar medium of the Galaxy, deriving reliable photometric distances to classical Cepheids of the Milky Way is a challenge. The typical approach is to use "reddening-free" indices, such as Wesenheit magnitudes, to obviate the need for an extinction correction. However, this approach could lead to unknown systematics - especially toward the inner Galaxy - as its assumption of a universal total-to-selective extinction ratio is not satisfied, particularly in lines of sight where the extinction is high and crosses spiral arms. We instead estimate new distances for 3424 Cepheids based on mid-IR photometry from WISE, which suffers minimally from extinction, and by adopting a 3D extinction map to calculate the necessary (albeit small) extinction corrections. We show that our distances are consistent with Gaia's parallaxes for the subset with relative parallax errors smaller than 10%, verifying that our mean distance errors are of the order of 6% and that the mean parallax zero point for this subsample is 7 $\mu$as.</description>

      <title>Discovery of WINERED-HVS1: A metal-rich hyper-velocity star candidate ejected from the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a metal-rich red giant star, WINERED-HVS1, which is a candidate for a hyper-velocity star (HVS). Its past trajectory suggests that this star may have been ejected by the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH; Sgr A*), with a modest ejection velocity of at least $500\; \mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$. Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a kinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS known as S5-HVS1. Therefore, the chemical characterization of this star is essential for understanding its origin. Through a spectroscopic follow-up observation with Magellan/WINERED, we determined its metallicity $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.147^{+0.046}_{-0.045}$, as well as the abundances for Na, Mg, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Sr. The high metallicity value suggests that this star was ejected from the Galactic center and is unlikely to be a halo star with a radial orbit. The abundance pattern of this star -- including the pattern of [$\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with that of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our view. This discovery opens a new window to look through the Galactic center environment without the hindrance of dust extinction, by using the HVSs moving in the halo region where dust extinction is minimal.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 59 most likely binary lenses and 48 binary sources. The tools were effective in detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf &gt; 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits &gt;~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically &gt;4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasma expansion on the dispersion properties of MHD waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the set of ideal expanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations within the Expanding Box Model (EBM) framework to theoretically characterize the effects of radial solar wind expansion on its characteristic linear MHD waves. Through the analytical derivation of dispersion relations by a first-order expansion of the MHD-EBM equations, we explore the changes in wave propagation across a range of heliocentric distances on the linear magnetohydrodynamic modes: the Alfv\'en mode and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes, as obtained from the ideal MHD-EBM equations. Our findings reveal a spatial dependence in the derived dispersion relations that aligns with both the literature and the traditional ideal MHD case in the non-expanding limit, thereby helping to bridge the gap between theory and observation in solar wind dynamics. We observe a general decrease in wave frequencies as the plasma expands farther from the Sun. This decrease is reflected in the dispersion relations through the radial decrease of both the Alfv\'en and sound speeds, which decrease proportionally to $1/R$ and $1/R^{\gamma - 1}$, respectively, where $\gamma$ is the plasma polytropic index. The fast magnetosonic mode frequency and phase speed are significantly affected by the polytropic index value. We consider three models for the polytropic index evolution in the expanding solar wind: a constant (quasi-adiabatic) case, a radially decreasing profile in the outer heliosphere, and a model incorporating thermodynamic heating effects. Notably, we find that in the case of a decreasing polytropic index, the fast magnetosonic mode experiences an acceleration in the distant heliosphere, highlighting the significant influence of expansion on solar wind dynamics.</description>
