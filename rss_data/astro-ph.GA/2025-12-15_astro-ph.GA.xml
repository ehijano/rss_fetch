      <title>Experimental investigation of O2 diffusion and entrapment in interstellar amorphous solid water (ASW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar ices are mainly composed of amorphous solid water (ASW) containing small amounts of hypervolatiles, such as O2, whose diffusion-limited reactions play a key role in space chemistry. Although O2 is an important precursor molecule present during the early stages of ice formation, its surface diffusion in ASW remains poorly constrained. In this study, we experimentally investigate the surface diffusion and the entrapment efficiency of O2 in porous ASW under astrophysically relevant conditions. Experiments were conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and monitored using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry. Diffusion coefficients were extracted through a novel approach applicable to IR-inactive molecules, by fitting the mass spectrometer signal during the isothermal phase with a Fickian model. These coefficients were then used to derive the diffusion energy barrier of O2 in ASW. Entrapment efficiencies were measured by analyzing the subsequent temperature-programmed desorption phase. We measured the surface diffusion coefficients at different temperatures (35 K, 40 K, 45 K) and water ice coverages (40 ML, 60 ML, 80 ML), yielding values on the order of 1E-16 to 1E-15 cm^2 s^-1. From these values, we derived a diffusion energy barrier of ED = 10 +/- 3 meV (116 +/- 35 K), corresponding to a chi ratio of about 0.1. Entrapment measurements revealed that a residual amount of about 20% of O2 remains trapped in the ASW matrix at the highest temperatures investigated. This work demonstrates that the surface diffusion of IR-inactive molecules can be experimentally quantified using mass spectrometry. Our findings show that O2 exhibits a low diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility in interstellar water ices. Moreover, we suggest these water ices likely retain a residual fraction of hypervolatiles entrapped within their structure.</description>

      <title>An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 is a rare system at $z = 1.98$, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of $M_{200\rm c}=1.6 \pm 0.3\times 10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ and $c_{200 \rm c}=6.3 \pm 0.3$, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived mass--concentration relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and a new JWST intracluster light measurement, we identify consistent NE--SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC 122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-$z$ lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at $z\sim2$ and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition and enrichment of the Centaurus cluster core seen by XRISM/Resolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot, X-ray emitting atmospheres pervading galaxy clusters are rich in metals, which have been synthesised and released by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) over cosmic history. This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical disequilibrium in dwarf galaxies: rethinking gas dynamics, rotation curves, and dark matter inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify departures from hydrodynamical and centrifugal equilibrium in the gas discs of low-mass ($10^{10.75}&lt;M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;10^{11}$) galaxies from the COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>The abundance of thin dwarf galaxies: a challenge for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prevalence of thin galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the range $10^7&lt;M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot}&lt;10^{11}$ using data from the GAMA, DESI, ALFALFA and Nearby Galaxy catalogs. We use the distribution of projected axis ratios, $q$, to infer the abundance of intrinsically flat galaxies needed to reproduce the observed abundance of highly elongated systems in projection. We find that as many as $40\%$ of galaxies in the mass range $10^9&lt;M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot}&lt;10^{10}$ are intrinsically flatter than $1$:$5$ (i.e., $c/a&lt;0.2$), a fraction that rises to $\sim 80\%$ for $c/a&lt;0.3$. Although the incidence of thin galaxies decreases towards lower and higher $M_{\star}$, they are still quite common in dwarfs: $\sim 30\%$ and $\sim 65\%$ of $\sim 10^8 ~ \rm{M_\odot}$ galaxies are inferred to be intrinsically flatter than $c/a=0.2$ and $0.3$, respectively. A comparison of these results with several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (TNG50, FIREbox, Romulus25) reveals a distinctive lack of thin simulated dwarfs. In particular, there are no $M_{\star} &lt; 10^9 ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ simulated galaxies flatter than $c/a=0.2$, in clear contrast with observational samples. This discrepancy likely reflects limitations in resolution and in the treatment of baryonic physics, suggesting that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation of disk galaxies less massive than the Milky Way is still quite incomplete. Our results present a clear challenge to current numerical models of dwarf galaxy formation, which future models should attempt to meet.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Mass Black Hole Binary Evolution in Nuclear Star Clusters: the effect of the stellar mass black hole population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binaries within Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) that contain a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). We examine how these stellar and BH populations influence the dynamics of the IMBH binary and, in turn, how the evolving IMBH binary affects the surrounding stellar and BH populations. We conduct high-resolution $N$-body simulations of NSCs constructed based on observational parameters from two local dwarf galaxies: NGC205 and NGC404. For the first time, we achieve a star particle mass resolution of $1\rm\;M_{\odot}$ and a BH mass resolution of $10\rm\;M_{\odot}$. This level of resolution is crucial for accurately modeling the collisional dynamics of these dense systems. Including stellar-mass BHs within the stellar population significantly influences the IMBH binary dynamics, nearly doubling the sinking rate and halving the merger time. During the initial phase of the inspiral, the IMBH binary disrupts both the stellar and BH cusps. However, the BH cusp quickly regains its steep slope due to its shorter relaxation time and continues to dominate the evolution of the IMBH binary, despite being much less massive compared to the stellar component. We uncover an interesting mechanism in which BHs first efficiently extract energy from the IMBH binary and then transfer this energy to the surrounding stars, allowing the BHs to spiral back toward the center of the system and restart the process. Our results imply that, although stellar mass BHs are a minor component of a stellar population, they can significantly facilitate IMBH growth within NSCs via mergers. We also notice that these dense systems can potentially boost Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) predominantly on radial orbits.</description>

      <title>MIRACLE III. JWST/MIRI expose the hidden role of the AGN outflow in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new JWST IFS observations of the active galaxy NGC 1068, combining Mid-IR and optical IFS data from MIRI and MUSE to characterize the multi-phase circumnuclear gas properties and its interaction with the AGN outflow and radio jet. MIRI data trace the multiphase gas emission up to 400 pc from the nucleus at 20--60 pc resolution, unveiling a clumpy ionized structure around the radio hot-spots and a rotating warm molecular disc. Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e &gt; 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind. We combined multi-cloud kinematic (MOKA) and photo-ionization (HOMERUN) modeling to characterize the ionized outflow properties and found that [OIV] traces an outflow 300 km/s faster than that inferred from [OIII], showing that the two lines originate from distinct gas components. This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission. The Mid-IR-revealed dusty component carries a significantly larger ionized-gas mass than what can be inferred from optical lines alone, showing that most of the outflowing mass is hidden from classical optical diagnostics. Our modelling point to a two-stage acceleration scenario, with velocities up to ~2000 km/s, consistent with an energy-driven wind. Our findings indicates that the outflow entrains up to a few 10**6 solar masses of ionized gas and couples efficiently with the surrounding ISM, injecting turbulence and impacting the host-galaxy environment.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on the S2 (S0-2) star possible companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center of the Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, Sgr\,A*, which is surrounded by a massive star cluster known as the S-cluster. The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\,\mu{\rm as}$. Current radial-velocity detection limits constrain viable stellar binary configurations to approximately 4.4\% of the simulated cases. Including astrometric limits reduces to 4.3\%. Imposing an additional constraint that any companion must have a mass $\lesssim 2\,M_{\odot}$ (otherwise it would be visible) narrows the fraction of undetectable stellar binaries to just 3.0\%.</description>

      <title>Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta&gt;3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\gamma$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Globular Clusters: Nurseries for Dynamically-Formed Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Effects of Varied Cosmic Ray Feedback from AGN on Massive Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Connection Between Dwarf Galaxies and Globular Clusters: Insights from the Perseus Cluster Using Subaru Imaging and Keck Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of 189 dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster (GC) systems in the Perseus cluster, based on deep Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging and Keck spectroscopy, supplemented by literature data. This constitutes the largest sample of dwarfs in a single galaxy cluster to date with simultaneous deep imaging, spectroscopic coverage, and GC measurements, while uniquely spanning a broad and continuous range of galaxy properties. We find an anti-correlation between GC specific mass and galaxy stellar mass for dwarfs in Perseus similar to observations in other clusters. At fixed stellar mass, dwarfs with lower surface brightness or larger effective radius tend to be more GC-rich -- suggesting either high GC formation efficiency in an earlier compact-galaxy phase, or less efficient GC disruption. The correlation between GC richness and axis ratio in Perseus is weaker than in other environments. We find some connection between GC richness and infall time, but not with the clear correlations found in Virgo, Coma, and cosmological simulations. More complete observations are needed to test for cluster-to-cluster variations in galaxy and GC evolutionary histories. This work demonstrates the potential of new wide-field imaging and spectroscopy surveys for understanding GCs and dwarf galaxies, and highlights the need for further work in theoretical modeling.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Stellar Evolution and Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are among the densest stellar environments in the universe. In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties.</description>

      <title>Synthetic polarization observations of magnetized pillars in HII regions: The limitations of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the morphology and strength of magnetic fields in pillar-shaped structures at the boundaries of HII regions by combining three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic, R-MHD, simulations with synthetic polarimetric observations. Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $\mu$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method. Our results highlight the need for caution when applying classical DCF-based analysis to pillars or other structures shaped by external compressions.</description>

      <title>Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of galaxies over 13 billion years in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas surface density (known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt, KS, relation) at kiloparsec (kpc) scales across cosmic time ($0\le z \le 8$) using the COLIBRE state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations feature on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to dust grain evolution and detailed radiative cooling down to $\approx 10$~K, enabling direct predictions for the atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) KS relations. At $z\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\le z\le 5$.</description>

      <title>The Influential Roles of Gravity, Turbulence, and Magnetic Fields in Shaping the Physical Evolution of Dense Massive Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the roles of the three competitors, namely, gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields, in controlling star formation (SF) within dense, massive clumps identified in the ATLASGAL survey. By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.</description>

      <title>Laboratory rotational spectroscopy and interstellar search for the protein precursor 4-oxobutanenitrile (HCOCH$_2$CH$_2$CN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the presence and distribution of prebiotic precursors in the interstellar medium (ISM) is key to tracing the chemical origins of life. Among them, 4-oxobutanenitrile (\ch{HCOCH2CH2CN}) has been identified in laboratory simulations as a plausible intermediate in the formation of glutamic acid, a proteinogenic amino acid. Here, we report its gas-phase rotational spectrum, measured using two complementary techniques: chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy (2$-$18 GHz) and free-jet millimeter-wave (FJ$-$AMMW) absorption spectroscopy (59.6$-$80 GHz). Quantum chemical calculations revealed nine low-energy conformers, of which the TC conformer was assigned based on the measured spectra. The resulting spectroscopic parameters were used to search for the molecule in the ultradeep spectral survey of the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, located in the Galactic Center. No signal attributable to 4$-$oxobutanenitrile was detected. A stringent upper limit to its column density was derived ($N&lt;$ 4 $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$), corresponding to a molecular abundance of $&lt;$ 2.9 $\times$10$^{-11}$ relative to H$_{2}$. This upper limit lies well below the observed abundances of simpler structurally related species containing $-$HCO and $-$CN groups, underscoring the challenge of detecting increasingly complex prebiotic molecules in the ISM and the need for future, more sensitive astronomical facilities.</description>

      <title>The multiphase interstellar medium as a common origin for magnetic misalignment and TB parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an original data analysis and a physical model that provide new insights into the origin of, and relationship between, two observables of the dusty, polarized Galaxy at intermediate and high latitudes: (i) the misalignment between HI filamentary structures and magnetic fields and (ii) the positive $TB$ correlation measured in Planck data suggesting parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM). We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.
  We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.
  The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.</description>

      <title>Rapid sinking and efficient mergers of supermassive black holes in compact high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation targeting the high redshift compact progenitor phase of massive galaxies, with the most massive galaxy reaching a stellar mass of $M_{\star}=8.5\times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of $z\sim 7-9$, starting at stellar masses of $M_\star\gtrsim 10^8\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and ending at a few times $M_{\star}\sim 10^9\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities ($\rho_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot/kpc^3}$), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just $\sim 4-35\ \mathrm{Myr}$ after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.</description>

      <title>A Spatially Resolved Evolutionary Sequence of Multi-wavelength AGN Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatially resolved star formation, gas ionisation, and outflow properties of 1813 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MaNGA survey, which we classify into infrared (IR), broad-line (BL), narrow-line (NL), and radio (RD) AGNs based on their mid-infrared colours, optical spectra, and/or radio photometry. We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.</description>

      <title>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): on the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster. V. Integrated stellar population properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: This paper presents new results from the ESO Large Programme Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS). The sample consists of low-surface brightness (LSB) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located inside 0.4 R$_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster. Integral field spectroscopy is acquired for 24 galaxies with the MUSE spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Aims: Our main objective is to analyse possible correlations between the environment and the integrated stellar population properties. Methods: For each galaxy, we extract the 1D stacked spectrum in an aperture of one effective radius and adopt previously published stellar kinematics to derive age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] through a full spectral fitting technique. Results: We find that the analysed LEWIS sample has a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -0.9 dex, a mean age of 10 Gyr, comparable to results of UDGs in other clusters. According to the projected phase-space, galaxies can be classified into two groups: early infallers, with slightly higher metallicities ([M/H]$_{early} = -0.8 \pm 0.1$ dex), and late infallers, with slightly lower values ([M/H]$_{late} = -1.0 \pm 0.1$ dex). Two types of galaxies are found in the early-infall region: half of them have metallicities consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation, while the other half show higher values. Moreover, they display different timescales for stellar mass assembly. Conclusions: We identified different classes of UDGs in the Hydra I cluster, which suggest different formation mechanisms taking place. Almost all of the UDGs and LSBs in the cluster are consistent with the puffed-up dwarf formation scenario, having dwarf-like metallicities and being consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation. In the innermost regions of the cluster, where metal-richer UDGs lie, tidal or environmental effects might have influenced their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The low-mass and structured stellar halo of M83 argues against a merger origin for its starburst and extended neutral hydrogen disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A merger origin has been suggested for M83's massive, metal-rich extended HI disk and nuclear starburst. We observe M83's stellar halo to test this idea. We train nearest-neighbor star-galaxy separation on wide-area Subaru imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to map M83's halo in resolved stars. We find that M83 has an extended, very low density smooth stellar halo of old and metal-poor [M/H]$\sim -1.15$ RGB stars with a mass between 15 and 40 kpc of $\log_{10}M_{*,15-40,maj}/M_{\odot}=8.02\pm0.10$. In addition to M83's well-known Northern Stream, our ground-based Subaru imaging reveals a new stream to M83's south, which modeling suggests could be its trailing arm. The combined stream masses are $\log_{10}M_{stream}/M_{\odot}=7.93\pm0.10$, with metallicity [M/H]$= -1.0\pm0.2$. The stream progenitor was only recently accreted, as its stellar populations suggest that it formed stars until $2.1\pm1.3$ Gyr ago. M83 lies on the stellar halo mass-metallicity correlation seen for other Milky Way mass galaxies, albeit with low stellar halo mass. We infer a total accreted mass of $\log_{10}M_{*,accreted}/M_{\odot}=8.78^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$, with the most massive past merger having $\log_{10}M_{*,dom}/M_{\odot}=8.5\pm0.3$. We identify plausible M83 analogs in TNG-50 with similar stellar halos, finding that while a recent accretion can create a prominent stellar stream, such accretions do not trigger starburst activity, nor do they deliver enough gas to form M83's extended Hi disk. We conclude that other non-merger mechanisms, such as secular evolution or accretion of gas from the IGM, are likely to be responsible for M83's remarkable properties.</description>

Abstract: The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) II: Discovery of five MSPs in M69 and M70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports recent discoveries from the Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey, which aims to uncover pulsars in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Utilising the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, the survey targets GCs accessible to uGMRT ($-53^\circ\,&lt;\,\delta\,&lt;\,-17^\circ$), excluding the declination range that can be covered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The survey focuses on GCs that have not previously been searched with comparable sensitivity in these radio frequencies. In this paper, we present the discovery of the five MSPs in two GCs, $-$ NGC~6637 (M69) and NGC~6681 (M70), each hosting MSPs identified here for the first time. Observations of M69 led to the discovery of two MSPs: J1831$-$3220A (M69A) and J1831$-$3220B (M69B), both of which we localize with arcsecond precision using interferometric imaging. Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis. Additionally, we present preliminary imaging results for other observed GCs, and in cases of non-detections, we report upper limits on pulsed emission based on the rms noise levels in the image plane.</description>

      <title>The Crab Nebula Revisited Using HST/WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence of tidal torque in the primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy angular momenta are imprinted by the early tidal field acting on their proto-structures, which are preserved through cosmic evolution and provide the potentially most precise measurement of the early universe. We test this prediction using the gas component of central massive elliptical galaxies, whose angular momenta respond sensitively to external torques. By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7\sigma$. These results provide the first robust observational confirmation of TTT and open a new window for cosmological measurements of neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Impacts of hydrogen envelope on supernova fallback and the resulting compact remnant masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fallback in core-collapse supernovae plays a central role in setting compact-remnant masses and may produce late-time emission. In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: II. The long-term evolution of free-floating comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population</description>

      <title>Transformer Embeddings for Fast Microlensing Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for free-floating planets (FFPs) is a key science driver for upcoming microlensing surveys like the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey. These rogue worlds are typically detected via short-duration microlensing events, the characterization of which often requires analyzing noisy, irregularly-sampled observations. We present a pipeline for this task using simulation-based inference. We use a Transformer encoder to learn a compressed summary representation of the raw time-series data, which in turn conditions a neural posterior estimator. We demonstrate that our method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors over three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We also demonstrate its performance on KMT-BLG-2019-2073, a short-duration FFP candidate event.</description>

      <title>The Luminosity Function and Clustering of H$\alpha$ Emitting Galaxies at $z\approx4-6$ from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6$ in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans $\sim$62 arcmin$^2$ and reaches $L_{\rm H\alpha} \sim 10^{41.2} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at $z \approx 4.41$ and $z \approx 5.19$, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H$\alpha$ LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at $z=3.75-5$, and for the protocluster at $z=5-6$ ($\alpha\approx 1.2$ to $-1.3$). In contrast, the field LF at $z=5-6$ is much steeper ($\alpha=-1.87_{-0.23}^{+0.30}$), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ are more evolved, resembling those at $z=3.75-5$. The observed star formation rate density from H$\alpha$, integrated down to 0.45 ${\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$, is $0.050^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$ and $0.046^{+0.006}_{-0.004} M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=3.75-5$ and $z=5-6$, with protoclusters contributing $\sim$25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at $z &gt; 4$ occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at $z &gt; 4$. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of $r_0 = 4.61^{+1.00}_{-0.68} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z \approx 4-5$ and $r_0 = 6.23^{+1.68}_{-1.13} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=5-6$. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be $\log (M_h/M_\odot)=11.0-11.2$ at $z\approx 4-6$, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.</description>

      <title>Extreme Neutral Outflow in a non-AGN Quiescent Galaxy at z~1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a substantial sodium doublet (Na D $\lambda\lambda$5890, 5896\AA)-traced neutral outflow in the quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at $z=1.317$. Its JWST/NIRSpec-MSA spectrum shows a deep, blueshifted Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. JADES-GS-206183 is also a peculiar quiescent galaxy with a spiral$+$bar morphology, high dust attenuation ($A_V=2.27\pm0.23$ mag). Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission from the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms its low star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR_{Pa\alpha}}=10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$), placing it 0.5 dex below the main-sequence ($\log(\mathrm{sSFR/yr^{-1}})=-10.2$). Despite the systematics introduced by different star formation history (SFH) priors, the SED modeling, combining HST-to-NIRCam photometry with the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests that JADES-GS-206183 experienced an older episode of star formation 0.5-2 Gyr ago and a possible rejuvenation within recent $\sim$10 Myr. Moreover, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it likely traces an ionized outflow rather than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, it may represent a long-lasting fossil outflow from past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.</description>

      <title>The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 6$ and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $&gt; 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5$ and $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Properties and Velocity Dispersion-Mass Relation of $z \sim 1$ Galaxy Clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a sample of 14 galaxy clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS (GG) spectroscopic datasets within the redshift range $(0.87 \leq z \leq 1.37)$ and cluster masses $\mathrm{M}_{200} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{14}$ \hm. Using the highly effective GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment developed by our own team, we derive the dynamical parameters of these clusters through the virial mass estimator. We examine the velocity dispersion-cluster mass relation $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ for the GG cluster sample. We find, $\log{\sigma_{200}} = (2.94\pm0.02) + (0.37\pm0.07)\log{\mathrm{M}_{200}}$ with an intrinsic scatter of $(\sigma_\mathrm{int} = 0.02 \pm 0.02)$. Our results demonstrate that the $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ relation is consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations, highlighting the reliability of the GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment. Furthermore, the $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ validates the robustness of the virial mass estimator in accurately recovering cluster masses and associated parameters. Importantly, our findings confirm that velocity dispersion can be used directly to estimate cluster mass without relying on dynamical mass estimators.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1$-$0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed $The~Egg$), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>Data-driven dust inference at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for accurately and precisely inferring photometric dust extinction towards stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic machine learning to model the colour-magnitude distribution of zero-extinction stars in these regions. Photometric dust maps rely on a robust method for inferring stellar reddening. At high Galactic latitudes, where extinction is low, such inferences are particularly susceptible to contamination from modelling errors and prior assumptions, potentially introducing artificial structure into dust maps. In this work, we demonstrate the use of normalising flows to learn the conditional probability distribution of the photometric colour-magnitude relations of zero-extinction stars, conditioned on Galactic cylindrical coordinates for stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes. By using the normalising flow to model the colour-magnitude diagram, we infer the posterior distribution of dust extinction towards stars along different lines of sight by marginalising over the colour-magnitude flow. We validate our method using data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS, showing that we can recover unbiased posteriors and successfully detect dust along the line-of-sight in two calibration regions at mid-Galactic latitude that have been extensively studied in the context of polarisation surveys.</description>

      <title>The impact of radial migration on disk galaxy star formation histories I. Biases in spatially resolved estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R &lt; h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved broad line region in a quasar at z=4: Dynamical black hole mass and prominent outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all four UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the \hb\ and \hg\ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. For the best fit model, more than 80\% of the \hi\ line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing \civ\ line profile and the systemic \oi\ fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning of halo gas density profiles: a sensitivity analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Galactic Halo Reconstruction from Rotation Curves in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter with an explicitly non-zero quartic self-interaction (gFDM) is shown to be a viable model for simultaneously fitting 17 dark-matter-dominated galaxies from the SPARC database, constraining both the boson mass, $m$, and the self-coupling constant, $g$, to values within the range $\log_{10}\left(\frac{m}{\mathrm{eV}/c^2}\right) = \log_{10}(1.98)-22^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ and $\log_{10}\left(\frac{g}{\mathrm{Jm}^3/kg}\right) = \log_{10}(1.45)-28^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$; this is based on the combination of an appropriately constructed static super-Gaussian profile for the inner galactic core (`soliton') region, and a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the surrounding halo region. Identification of these parameters enables the explicit {\em dynamical} reconstruction of potential host halos for such galaxies, for which we outline a procedure with a proof-of-principle demonstration for two galaxies (UGCA444, UGC07866) shown to yield viable rotation curves over a dynamical period of $O(1) \, Gyr$.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>

Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</description>

      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have long been hypothesized as valuable indicators of black holes, offering insight into their demographics and behaviour out to high redshift. TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\,M_\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\,M_\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes.</description>
