      <title>Multipliers for spherical harmonic expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any bounded, regulated function $m: [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{C}$, consider the family of operators $\{ T_R \}$ on the sphere $S^d$ such that $T_R f = m(k/R) f$ for any spherical harmonic $f$ of degree $k$. We completely characterize the compactly supported functions $m$ for which the operators $\{ T_R \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, in the range $1/(d-1) &lt; |1/p - 1/2| &lt; 1/2$. We obtain analogous results in the more general setting of multiplier operators for eigenfunction expansions of an elliptic pseudodifferential operator $P$ on a compact manifold $M$, under curvature assumptions on the principal symbol of $P$, and assuming the eigenvalues of $P$ are contained in an arithmetic progression. One consequence of our result are new transference principles controlling the $L^p$ boundedness of the multiplier operators associated with a function $m$, in terms of the $L^p$ operator norm of the radial Fourier multiplier operator with symbol $m(|\cdot|): \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{C}$. In order to prove these results, we obtain new quasi-orthogonality estimates for averages of solutions to the half-wave equation $\partial_t - i P = 0$, via a connection between pseudodifferential operators satisfying an appropriate curvature condition and Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>An improved bound on the Hausdorff dimension of sticky Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kakeya sets are compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that contain a unit line segment pointing in every direction. The Kakeya conjecture states that such sets must have Hausdorff dimension $n$. The property of stickiness was first discovered by Katz-{\L}aba-Tao in their 1999 breakthrough paper on the Kakeya problem. Then Wang-Zahl formalized the definition of a sticky Kakeya set, and proposed a special case of the Kakeya conjecture for such sets. Specifically this conjecture states that sticky Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ have Hausdorff dimension $n$ and Wang-Zahl went on to prove the conjecture for $n=3$.
  A planebrush is a geometric object which is a higher dimensional analogue of Wolff's hairbrush. Using the planebrush argument, Katz-Zahl showed that Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^4$ have Hausdorff dimension at least 3.059. If we restrict our attention to sticky Kakeya sets, we can improve upon this bound by combining the planebrush result with additional stickiness property. To be precise, we will show in this paper that sticky Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^4$ have dimension at least 3.25.</description>

      <title>Short remark on dimension-free estimates for discrete maximal functions over $l^q$ balls: small scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a dimension-free bound on $l^p(\mathbb{Z} ^d)$, $p \in [2, \infty]$ for the discrete Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator over the $l^q$ balls in $\mathbb{Z} ^d$ with small dyadic radii. Our result combined with the work of Kosz, Mirek, Plewa, Wr\'obel gives dimension-free estimates on $l^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, $p \in [2, \infty]$ for the discrete dyadic Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator over $l^q$ balls for $q \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $-\partial_tu + \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on a Lipschitz cylinder $\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).
  We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. We note that answer to this question was not known even in the {\it small Carleson case}, that is, when the Carleson norm of coefficients is sufficiently small.
  In the elliptic case the analogous question was only fully resolved recently independently by two groups, with two very different methods: one involving two of the authors and S. Hofmann, the second by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa. Our approach in the parabolic case is motivated by that of the first group, but in the parabolic setting there are significant new challenges.</description>

      <title>Sets and partitions minimising small differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a bounded measurable set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ we denote the Lebesgue measure of $\{(x, y)\in A^2\colon x\le y\le x+1\}$ by $\Phi(A)$. We prove that if $I=A_1\cup\dots\cup A_{k+1}$ partitions an interval $I$ of length $L$ into $k+1$ measurable pieces, then $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \Phi(A_i)\ge (\sqrt{k^2+1}-k)L-1$, where the multiplicative constant $\sqrt{k^2+1}-k$ is optimal. As a matter of fact we obtain the more general result that $\Phi(A)\ge (\xi+\sqrt{1-2\xi+2\xi^2}-1)L-1$ whenever $A\subseteq I$ has measure $\xi L$.</description>

      <title>Dimension and structure of the Robin Harmonic Measure on Rough Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper establishes that the Robin harmonic measure is quantitatively mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure on any Ahlfors regular set in any (quantifiably) connected domain for any elliptic operator. This stands in contrast with analogous results for the Dirichlet boundary value problem and also contradicts the expectation, supported by simulations in the physics literature, that the dimension of the Robin harmonic measure in rough domains exhibits a phase transition as the boundary condition interpolates between completely reflecting and completely absorbing.
  In the adopted traditional language, the corresponding harmonic measure exhibits no dimension drop, and the absolute continuity necessitates neither rectifiability of the boundary nor control of the oscillations of the coefficients of the equation. The expected phase transition is rather exhibited through the detailed non-scale-invariant weight estimates.</description>

      <title>Decoupling for smooth surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $d\geq 0$, we prove decoupling inequalities in $\mathbb R^3$ for the graphs of all bivariate polynomials of degree at most $d$ with bounded coefficients, with the decoupling constant depending uniformly in $d$ but not the coefficients of each individual polynomial. As a consequence, we prove a decoupling inequality for (a compact piece of) every smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which in particular solves a conjecture of Bourgain, Demeter and Kemp.</description>

      <title>Large Salem Sets Avoiding Nonlinear Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct large Salem sets avoiding patterns, complementing previous constructions of pattern avoiding sets with large Hausdorff dimension. For a (possibly uncountable) family of uniformly Lipschitz functions $\{ f_i : (\mathbb{T}^d)^{n-2} \to \mathbb{T}^d \}$, we obtain a Salem subset of $\mathbb{T}^d$ with dimension $d/(n-1)$ avoiding nontrivial solutions to the equation $x_n - x_{n-1} = f_i(x_1,\dots,x_{n-2})$. For a countable family of smooth functions $\{ f_i : (\mathbb{T}^d)^{n-1} \to \mathbb{T}^d \}$ satisfying a modest geometric condition, we obtain a Salem subset of $\mathbb{T}^d$ with dimension $d/(n-3/4)$ avoiding nontrivial solutions to the equation $x_n = f(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$. For a set $Z \subset \mathbb{T}^{dn}$ which is the countable union of a family of sets, each with lower Minkowski dimension $s$, we obtain a Salem subset of $\mathbb{T}^d$ of dimension $(dn - s)/(n - 1/2)$ whose Cartesian product does not intersect $Z$ except at points with non-distinct coordinates.</description>

      <title>An Exact Perturbative Existence and Uniqueness Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate singularly perturbed nonlinear complex differential systems of the form $\hbar \partial_x f = F (x, \hbar, f)$ where $\hbar$ is a small complex perturbation parameter. Under a geometric assumption on the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of $F$, we prove an Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for exact perturbative solutions; i.e., holomorphic solutions with prescribed perturbative expansions in $\hbar$. In fact, these solutions are the Borel resummation of the formal perturbative solutions.</description>

      <title>Study guide for "On restricted projections to planes in $\mathbb R^3$"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a study guide for ``On restricted projections to planes in $\mathbb R^3$" [arXiv:2207.13844] by Gan, Guo, Guth, Harris, Maldague and Wang. We first present the main problems and preliminaries related to restricted projections in $\mathbb R^3$. Then we introduce the high-low method and decoupling, which are the two central and novel ideas in their proofs. We hope to provide as many details as possible so that this study guide is self-contained, with the only exception of the Bourgain-Demeter decoupling inequality for curves in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Spherical Particle in Nematic Liquid Crystal with a Magnetic Field and Planar Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy in $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B_1(0)$ with external magnetic field in the large particle limit. We impose strong tangential anchoring and uniaxiality of the $Q-$tensor on the boundary. We derive a lower bound for the energy in terms of the boundary condition and show in the extreme cases of strong and weak magnetic field strength that the longitudinal director field is energy minimizing, indicating the presence of two half-point defects, so called boojums, at two opposite points of the sphere. Using a recovery sequence, we show that the energy bound is optimal in these extreme cases.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the three dimensional Maxwell-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we prove global well-posedness for the massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the Lorenz gauge in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, for small, sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data, as well as modified scattering for the solutions. Heuristically we exploit the close connection between the massive Maxwell-Dirac and the wave-Klein-Gordon equations, while developing a novel approach which applies directly at the level of the Dirac equations. The modified scattering result follows from a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions inside the light cone, which we derive via the method of testing with wave packets of Ifrim-Tataru.</description>
