      <title>Improving the convergence of Markov chains via permutations and projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at improving the convergence to equilibrium of finite ergodic Markov chains via permutations and projections. First, we prove that a specific mixture of permuted Markov chains arises naturally as a projection under the KL divergence or the squared-Frobenius norm. We then compare various mixing properties of the mixture with other competing Markov chain samplers and demonstrate that it enjoys improved convergence. This geometric perspective motivates us to propose samplers based on alternating projections to combine different permutations and to analyze their rate of convergence. We give necessary, and under some additional assumptions also sufficient, conditions for the projection to achieve stationarity in the limit in terms of the trace of the transition matrix. We proceed to discuss tuning strategies of the projection samplers when these permutations are viewed as parameters. Along the way, we reveal connections between the mixture and a Markov chain Sylvester's equation as well as assignment problems, and highlight how these can be used to understand and improve Markov chain mixing. We provide two examples as illustrations. In the first example, the projection sampler (with a suitable choice of the permutation) improves upon Metropolis-Hastings in a discrete bimodal distribution with a reduced relaxation time from exponential to polynomial in the system size, while in the second example, the mixture of permuted Markov chain yields a mixing time that is logarithmic in system size (with high probability under random permutation), compared to a linear mixing time in the Diaconis-Holmes-Neal sampler.</description>

      <title>The discrepancy in min-max statistics between two random matrices with finite third moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel coupling inequality of the min-max type for two random matrices with finite absolute third moments, which generalizes the quantitative versions of the well-known inequalities by Gordon. Previous results have calculated the quantitative bounds for pairs of Gaussian random matrices. Through integrating the methods utilized by Chatterjee-Meckes and Reinert-R\"ollin in adapting Stein's method of exchangeable pairs for multivariate normal approximation, this study eliminates the Gaussian restriction on random matrices, enabling us to achieve more extensive results.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Isometry Property of Block Diagonal Matrices Generated by $\varphi$-Sub-Gaussian Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the restricted isometry property of block diagonal random matrices with elements from $\varphi$-sub-Gaussian variables, which extends the previously known results for the sub-Gaussian case. A crucial ingredient of our proof is an improved uniform Hanson-Wright deviation inequality, which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen bounds for large-time asymptotics of one-dimensional diffusion processes via Malliavin-Stein method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions of stochastic differential equations which diverge to infinity as the time parameter goes to infinity. If the coefficients converge as the spacial variable goes to infinity, then the solutions will get close to some Gaussian processes with positive drifts as the time parameter goes to infinity. In this paper, we prove Berry-Esseen type bounds for the solutions in this setting. In particular, we obtain bounds of the total variation distance between the law of the centered and scaled solutions of the stochastic differential equations and the standard normal distribution with an optimal rate of convergence in the time parameter. In the proof we apply the Malliavin-Stein method to estimate the total variation distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the discounted optimal stopping problem for a real valued Markov process with only positive jumps. We provide a theorem to verify that the optimal stopping region has the form {x &gt;= x^*} for some critical threshold x^*, and a representation formula for the value function of the problem in terms of the Green kernel of the process, based on Dynkin's characterization of the value function as the least excessive majorant. As an application of our results, using the Fourier transform to compute the Green kernel of the process, we solve a new example: the optimal stopping for a Levy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process used to model prices in electricity markets.</description>

      <title>On the number of crossings and bouncings of a diffusion at a sticky threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish between three types of crossing behaviors at a sticky threshold for a one-dimensional sticky diffusion process and analyze the asymptotic properties of the three corresponding number of crossings statistics in case the process is sticky Brownian motion. To each type of crossings corresponds a distinct asymptotic regime of the statistic. Additionally, we consider three types of bouncing behavior as symmetric counterparts to crossing behaviors. The number of bouncings behaves similarly to its number of crossings counterpart when the process is sticky Brownian motion. From this we deduce the behavior of the number of bouncings of sticky-reflected Brownian motion. The results on crossings and bouncings are extended to sticky diffusions. As an application, we propose consistent estimators for the stickiness parameter of sticky diffusions and sticky-reflected Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Stationary random measures : Covariance asymptotics, variance bounds and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider covariance asymptotics for linear statistics of general stationary random measures in terms of their truncated pair correlation measure. We give exact infinite series-expansion formulas for covariance of smooth statistics of random measures involving higher-order integrals of the truncated correlation measures and higher-order derivatives of the test functions and also equivalently in terms of their Fourier transforms. Exploiting this, we describe possible covariance and variance asymptotics for Sobolev and indicator statistics. In the smooth case, we show that that order of variance asymptotics drops by even powers and give a simple example of random measure exhibiting such a variance reduction. In the case of indicator statistics of C1-smooth sets, we derive covariance asymptotics at surface-order scale with the limiting constant depending on intersection of the boundaries of the two sets. We complement this by a lower bound for random measures with a non-trivial atomic part. Restricting to simple point processes, we prove a central limit theorem for Sobolev and Holder continuous statistics of simple point processes satifying a certain integral identity for higher-order truncated correlation functions.</description>

      <title>TowerDebias: A Novel Debiasing Method based on the Tower Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making processes have increasingly come to rely on sophisticated machine learning tools, raising concerns about the fairness of their predictions with respect to any sensitive groups. The widespread use of commercial black-box machine learning models necessitates careful consideration of their legal and ethical implications on consumers. In situations where users have access to these "black-box" models, a key question emerges: how can we mitigate or eliminate the influence of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender? We propose towerDebias (tDB), a novel approach designed to reduce the influence of sensitive variables in predictions made by black-box models. Using the Tower Property from probability theory, tDB aims to improve prediction fairness during the post-processing stage in a manner amenable to the Fairness-Utility Tradeoff. This method is highly flexible, requiring no prior knowledge of the original model's internal structure, and can be extended to a range of different applications. We provide a formal improvement theorem for tDB and demonstrate its effectiveness in both regression and classification tasks, underscoring its impact on the fairness-utility tradeoff.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the martingale property of entropy production in stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we develop a family of martingales and work theorems for the same stochastic process. We achieve this by introducing an alternative work theorem derivation that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path integrals. Our derivation applies to both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics and generalizes work theorems so that they connect new quantities in stochastic processes, potentially revealing new applications in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>The Sylvester question in $\mathbb{R}^d$: convex sets with a flat floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pick $n$ independent and uniform random points $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ in a compact convex set $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with volume 1, and let $P^{(d)}_K(n)$ be the probability that these points are in convex position. The Sylvester conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is that $\min_K P^{(d)}_K(d+2)$ is achieved by the $d$-dimensional simplices $K$ (only).
  In this paper, we focus on a companion model, already studied in the $2d$ case, which we define in any dimension $d$: we say that $K$ has $F$ as a flat floor, if $F$ is a subset of $K$, contained in a hyperplan $P$, such that $K$ lies in one of the half-spaces defined by $P$.
  We define $Q_K^F(n)$ as the probability that $U_1,\cdots,U_n$ together with $F$ are in convex position (i.e., the $U_i$ are on the boundary of the convex hull ${\sf CH}(\{U_1,\cdots,U_n\}\cup F\})$). We prove that, for all fixed $F$,
  $K\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ reaches its minimum on the "mountains" with floor $F$ (mountains are convex hull of $F$ union an additional vertex), while the maximum is not reached, but $K\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ has values arbitrary close to 1. If the optimisation is done on the set of $K$ contained in $F\times[0,d]$ (the "subprism case"), then the minimum is also reached by the mountains, and the maximum by the "prism" $F\times[0,1]$. Since again, $Q_K^F{(2)}$ relies on the expected volume (of ${\sf CH}(\{V_1,V_2\}\cup F\})$), this result can be seen as a proof of the Sylvester problem in the floor case.
  In $2d$, where $F$ can essentially be the segment $[0,1],$ we give a general decomposition formula for $Q_K^F(n)$ so to compute several formulas and bounds for different $K$. In 3D, we give some bounds for $Q_K^F(n)$ for various floors $F$ and special cases of $K$.</description>

      <title>A finitary Kronecker's lemma and large deviations in the Strong Law of Large numbers on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the computational content of Kronecker's lemma via the proof-theoretic perspective of proof mining and utilise the resulting finitary variant of this fundamental result to provide new rates for the Strong Law of Large Numbers for random variables taking values in type $p$ Banach spaces, which in particular are very uniform in the sense that they do not depend on the distribution of the random variables. Furthermore, we provide computability-theoretic arguments to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Kronecker's lemma and investigate the result from the perspective of Reverse Mathematics. In addition, we demonstrate how this ineffectiveness from Kronecker's lemma trickles down to the Strong Law of Large Numbers by providing a construction that shows that computable rates of convergence are not always possible. Lastly, we demonstrate how Kronecker's lemma falls under a class of deterministic formulas whose solution to their Dialectica interpretation satisfies a continuity property and how, for such formulas, one obtains an upgrade principle that allows one to lift computational interpretations of deterministic results to quantitative results for their probabilistic analogue. This result generalises the previous work of the author and Pischke.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the general theory of embedding independence tests on Hilbert spaces that generalizes the concepts of distance covariance, distance multivariance and HSIC. This is done by defining new types of kernel on an $n$ Cartesian product called positive definite independent of order $k$. An emphasis is given on the continuous case in order to obtain a version of the Kernel Mean Embedding for this new classes of kernels. We also provide $2$ explicit methods to construct examples for this new type of kernel on a general space by using Bernstein functions of several variables and completely monotone functions of higher order.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</description>

Abstract: For a natural number n, let M(n) denote the maximum exponent of any prime power dividing n, and let m(n) denote the minimum exponent of any prime power dividing n. We study the second moments of these arithmetic functions and establish their limiting distributions. We introduce a new discrete probabilistic distribution dependent on a function f taking values in [0,1], study its first two moments, and provide examples of several arithmetic functions satisfying such distribution as their limiting behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with no external field and inverse temperature $\beta&lt;1$ and prove that the expected operator norm of the covariance matrix of the Gibbs measure is bounded by a constant depending only on $\beta$. This answers an open question raised by Talagrand, who proved a bound of $C(\beta) (\log n)^8$. Our result follows by establishing an approximate formula for the covariance matrix which we obtain by differentiating the TAP equations and then optimally controlling the associated error terms. We complement this result by showing diverging lower bounds on the operator norm, both at the critical and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Bipolar Theorems for Sets of Non-negative Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper assumes a robust, in general not dominated, probabilistic framework and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a bipolar representation of subsets of the set of all quasi-sure equivalence classes of non-negative random variables, without any further conditions on the underlying measure space. This generalizes and unifies existing bipolar theorems proved under stronger assumptions on the robust framework. Applications are in areas of robust financial modeling.</description>

      <title>Empirical approximation of the gaussian distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots,G_m$ be independent copies of the standard gaussian random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that there is an absolute constant $c$ such that for any $A \subset S^{d-1}$, with probability at least $1-2\exp(-c\Delta m)$, for every $t\in\mathbb{R}$, \[ \sup_{x \in A} \left| \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m 1_{ \{\langle G_i,x\rangle \leq t \}} - \mathbb{P}(\langle G,x\rangle \leq t) \right| \leq \Delta + \sigma(t) \sqrt\Delta. \] Here $\sigma(t) $ is the variance of $1_{\{\langle G,x\rangle\leq t\}}$ and $\Delta\geq \Delta_0$, where $\Delta_0$ is determined by an unexpected complexity parameter of $A$ that captures the set's geometry (Talagrand's $\gamma_1$ functional). The bound, the probability estimate, and the value of $\Delta_0$ are all (almost) optimal.
  We use this fact to show that if $\Gamma=\sum_{i=1}^m \langle G_i,x\rangle e_i$ is the random matrix that has $G_1,\dots,G_m$ as its rows, then the structure of $\Gamma(A)=\{\Gamma x: x\in A\}$ is far more rigid and well-prescribed than was previously expected.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spin Limit Shape of Young Diagram and Spin Jucys-Murphy Elements for Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The branching rule for spin irreducible representations of symmetric groups gives rise to a Markov chain on the spin dual $(\widetilde{\mathfrak{S}}_n)^\wedge_{\mathrm{spin}}$ of symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ through restriction and induction of spin irreducible representations. This further produces a continuous time random walk $(X_s^{(n)})_{s\geqq 0}$ on $(\widetilde{\mathfrak{S}}_n)^\wedge_{\mathrm{spin}}$ by introducing an appropriate pausing time. Taking diffusive scaling limit for these random walks under $s=tn$ and $1/\sqrt{n}$ reduction as $n\to\infty$, we consider a concentration phenomenon at each macroscopic time $t$. Since an element of $(\widetilde{\mathfrak{S}}_n)^\wedge_{\mathrm{spin}}$ is regarded as a strict partition of $n$ with $\pm 1$ indices, the limit shapes of profiles of strict partitions appear. In this paper, we give a framework in which initial concentration at $t=0$ is propagated to concentration at any $t&gt;0$. We thus obtain the limit shape $\omega_t$ depending on macroscopic time $t$, and describe the time evolution by using devices in free probability theory. Included is the case where Kerov's transition measure has non-compact support but determinate moment problem. A spin version of Biane's formula for spin Jucys--Murphy elements is shown, which plays an important role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Persistence and neutrality in interacting replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of an ensemble of entities obeying replicator-like stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions as a model for a primordial ecology. We prove the propagation-of-chaos property and establish conditions for the strong persistence of the $N$-replicator system and the existence of invariant distributions for a class of associated McKean-Vlasov dynamics. In particular, our results show that, unlike typical models of neutral ecology, fitness equivalence does not need to be assumed but emerges as a condition for the persistence of the system. Further, neutrality is associated with a unique Dirichlet invariant probability measure. We illustrate our findings with some simple case studies, provide numerical results, and discuss our conclusions in the light of Neutral Theory in ecology.</description>

      <title>Fast relaxation of the random field Ising dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence properties of Glauber dynamics for the random field Ising model (RFIM) with ferromagnetic interactions on finite domains of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$. Of particular interest is the Griffiths phase where correlations decay exponentially fast in expectation over the quenched disorder, but there exist arbitrarily large islands of weak fields where low-temperature behavior is observed. Our results are twofold:
  1. Under weak spatial mixing (boundary-to-bulk exponential decay of correlations) in expectation, we show that the dynamics satisfy a weak Poincar\'e inequality implying algebraic relaxation to equilibrium over timescales polynomial in the volume $N$ of the domain, and polynomial time mixing from a warm start. From this we construct a polynomial-time approximate sampling algorithm based on running Glauber dynamics over an increasing sequence of approximations of the domain.
  2. Under strong spatial mixing (exponential decay of correlations even near boundary pinnings) in expectation, we prove a full Poincar\'e inequality, implying exponential relaxation to equilibrium and $N^{o(1)}$-mixing time. Note by way of example, both weak and strong spatial mixing hold at any temperature, provided the external fields are strong enough.
  Our proofs combine a stochastic localization technique which has the effect of increasing the variance of the field, with a field-dependent coarse graining which controls the resulting sub-critical percolation process of sites with weak fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between tagged particles and size-biased empirical processes in interacting particle systems, in analogy to classical results on the propagation of chaos. In a mean-field scaling limit, the evolution of the occupation number on the tagged particle site converges to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process with non-linear master equation given by the law of large numbers of size-biased empirical measures. The latter are important in recent efforts to understand the dynamics of condensation in interacting particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a Trotter-Kato type theorem. More precisely, we characterize the convergence in distribution of Feller processes by examining the convergence of their generators. The main novelty lies in providing quantitative estimates in the vague topology at any fixed time. As important applications, we deduce functional central limit theorems for random walks on the positive integers with boundary conditions, which converge to Brownian motions on the positive half-line with boundary conditions at zero.</description>

Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Strong Approximations for Empirical Processes Indexed by Lipschitz Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents new uniform Gaussian strong approximations for empirical processes indexed by classes of functions based on $d$-variate random vectors ($d\geq1$). First, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for general empirical processes indexed by possibly Lipschitz functions, improving on previous results in the literature. In the setting considered by Rio (1994), and if the function class is Lipschitzian, our result improves the approximation rate $n^{-1/(2d)}$ to $n^{-1/\max\{d,2\}}$, up to a $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ term, where $n$ denotes the sample size. Remarkably, we establish a valid uniform Gaussian strong approximation at the rate $n^{-1/2}\log n$ for $d=2$, which was previously known to be valid only for univariate ($d=1$) empirical processes via the celebrated Hungarian construction (Koml\'os et al., 1975). Second, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for multiplicative separable empirical processes indexed by possibly Lipschitz functions, which addresses some outstanding problems in the literature (Chernozhukov et al., 2014, Section 3). Finally, two other uniform Gaussian strong approximation results are presented when the function class is a sequence of Haar basis based on quasi-uniform partitions. Applications to nonparametric density and regression estimation are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to infer new choices from prior choices using the framework of choice functions, a unifying mathematical framework for decision-making based on sets of preference orders. In particular, we define the natural (most conservative) extension of a given choice assessment to a coherent choice function -- whenever possible -- and use this natural extension to make new choices. We provide a practical algorithm for computing this natural extension and various ways to improve scalability. Finally, we test these algorithms for different types of choice assessments.</description>

      <title>Improved performance guarantees for Tukey's median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there a natural way to order data in dimension greater than one? The approach based on the notion of data depth, often associated with the name of John Tukey, is among the most popular. Tukey's depth has found applications in robust statistics, graph theory, and the study of elections and social choice. We present improved performance guarantees for empirical Tukey's median, a deepest point associated with the given sample, when the data-generating distribution is elliptically symmetric and possibly anisotropic. Some of our results remain valid in the wider class of affine equivariant estimators. As a corollary of our bounds, we show that the diameter of the set of all empirical Tukey's medians scales like $o(n^{-1/2})$ where $n$ is the sample size. Moreover, when the data are 2-dimensional, we prove that the diameter is of order $O(n^{-3/4}\log^{3/2}(n))$.</description>

      <title>Reduced Sample Complexity in Scenario-Based Control System Design via Constraint Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scenario approach is widely used in robust control system design and chance-constrained optimization, maintaining convexity without requiring assumptions about the probability distribution of uncertain parameters. However, the approach can demand large sample sizes, making it intractable for safety-critical applications that require very low levels of constraint violation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel yet simple constraint scaling method, inspired by large deviations theory. Under mild nonparametric conditions on the underlying probability distribution, we show that our method yields an exponential reduction in sample size requirements for bilinear constraints with low violation levels compared to the classical approach, thereby significantly improving computational tractability. Numerical experiments on robust pole assignment problems support our theoretical findings.</description>
