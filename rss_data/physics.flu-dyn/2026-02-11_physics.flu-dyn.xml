      <title>Stall cells over an airfoil. Part 1: Three-dimensional flow organisation and vorticity dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the three-dimensional organisation and evolution of stall cells in the separated flow region over an airfoil. Using a hybrid RANS/LES approach based on the DDES-SST turbulence model, we characterise the formation and development of these structures, which remain challenging to capture experimentally. Initial validation confirms accurate reproduction of global loads when comparing with both experimental data and RANS simulations. The complex three-dimensional flow organisation is analysed through investigating the vorticity, revealing that spanwise variation of the separation location leads to non-uniform load distribution along the airfoil span. The mid-span experiences premature separation due to flow bifurcation, while flow attraction at $\pm1$ chord length successfully sustains attached flow further along the chord. The separated flow generates a shear layer culminating in a separation vortex tube, which exhibits a Crow-type instability when interacting with the counter-rotating trailing edge vortex tube. This instability induces a wave-like bending of the vortex tubes and shear layer, generating significant vertical vorticity (y-vorticity) that drives spanwise flow. We identify a previously unreported phenomenon where the maxima of spanwise velocity structures exhibit rotation around fixed spanwise axes, with the rotation angle evolving linearly with downstream distance according to $\zeta = 14.5(x/c) - 0.8$. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying stall cell formation and highlights the importance of three-dimensional effects in separated flows, which has implications for aerodynamic load prediction and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Stall cells over an airfoil. Part 2: A vortex-based analytical model for their formation and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stall cells are spanwise-periodic flow structures that spontaneously form on airfoils operating near stall, fundamentally altering the aerodynamic loading distribution. Despite decades of experimental observations, a complete theoretical framework connecting vortex dynamics to the characteristic flow patterns has remained elusive. In this work, we develop an analytical model for stall cell formation based on the interaction between finite-length, counter-rotating vortex tubes representing the separation vortex and trailing-edge vortex. Linear stability analysis of the coupled vortex system yields the growth rate and wavelength selection of the Crow-type instability responsible for the wave-like bending of the vortex structures. A weakly nonlinear analysis using the method of multiple scales is performed to derive the Stuart--Landau amplitude equation, providing an explicit expression for the saturation amplitude at which nonlinear effects arrest the instability growth and establish quasi-steady cellular structures. The vortex sheet representing the separated shear layer is coupled to the vortex tube dynamics through the Birkhoff--Rott equation, from which we derive the induced vertical vorticity $\Omega_y$ that drives the alternating spanwise velocity characteristic of stall cells. The model predicts quantitatively the spanwise velocity magnitude, vertical vorticity distribution, and vortex sheet deformation. The resulting framework provides a unified, first-principles description connecting the Crow-type instability of counter-rotating vortex tubes to the observed flow topology of stall cells. The model is validated against the DDES simulation data presented in the companion paper, demonstrating strong agreement.</description>

      <title>From oblique-wave forcing to streak reinforcement: A perturbation-based frequency-response framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation-based frequency-response framework for analyzing amplification mechanisms that are central to subcritical routes to transition in wall-bounded shear flows. By systematically expanding the input-output dynamics of fluctuations about the laminar base flow with respect to forcing amplitude, we establish a rigorous correspondence between linear resolvent analysis and higher-order nonlinear interactions. At second order, quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves generate steady streamwise streaks via the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of these streaks is captured by the second output singular function of the streamwise-constant resolvent operator. At higher orders, nonlinear coupling between oblique waves and induced streaks acts as structured forcing of the laminar linearized dynamics, yielding additional streak components whose relative phase governs reinforcement or attenuation of the leading-order streak response. Our analysis identifies a critical forcing amplitude marking the breakdown of the weakly nonlinear regime, beyond which direct numerical simulations exhibit sustained unsteadiness. We show that this breakdown coincides with the onset of secondary instability, revealing that the nonlinear interactions responsible for streak formation also drive the modal growth central to classical transition theory. The resulting framework provides a mechanistically transparent and computationally efficient description of transition that unifies non-modal amplification, streak formation, and modal instability within a single formulation derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of Solitary Wave Modes in Long-Runout Debris Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris flows often exhibit coherent wave structures-shock-like roll waves on steeper slopes and weaker, more sinusoidal dispersive pulses on gentler slopes. Coarse-rich heads raise basal resistance, whereas fines-rich tails lower it; in gentle reaches, small-amplitude pulses can locally transport momentum across low-resistance segments. We focus on this gentle-slope, long-wave, low-amplitude regime, where the base-flow Froude number is order unity. In this limit, we obtain a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) reduction from depth-averaged balances with frictional (Coulomb) and viscous-plastic basal options, using a curvature-type internal normal-stress closure in the long-wave small-k regime. Multiple-scale analysis yields effective nonlinear and dispersive coefficients. We also introduce a practical nonlinearity diagnostic that can be computed from observed crest speeds and flow thicknesses. When laboratory-frame crest celerity is available, we estimate an effective quadratic coefficient from the KdV speed-amplitude relation and report its ratio to the shallow-water reference. When only a depth-averaged first-surge speed and thickness are available, we use the same construction to form a velocity-based proxy and note its bias near zero. A Froude-slope diagram organizes published cases into a steep-slope roll-wave domain and a gentle-slope corridor where KdV pulses are admissible. Numerical solutions of the full depth-averaged model produce cnoidal and solitary waves that agree with the reduced KdV predictions within this corridor. We regard dispersive pulses as a regime-specific complement to roll-wave dynamics, offering a condition-dependent contribution to mobility on gentle reaches rather than a universal explanation for long runout.</description>

      <title>A theoretical one-dimensional model for variable-density Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an early theoretical work published in 1965, Belen'kii &amp; Fradkin proposed a turbulent diffusivity model for Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) mixing. We review its derivation and present alternative arguments leading to the same final similarity equation. The original work then introduced an approximation that led to a simplified ordinary differential equation (ODE), which was used primarily to derive the important scaling result, $h \sim (\ln R)gt^2$. Here, we extend the analysis by examining the solutions to both the full similarity ODE and the simplified ODE in detail. It is shown that the full similarity equation captures many now well-known features of non-Boussinesq RT flows, including asymmetric spike and bubble growth and a systematic shift of velocity statistics toward the light-fluid side. Comparisons of the theoretical model with numerical and experimental studies show reasonable agreement in both spatial profiles and growth trends of mixing layer heights. We further show that a global mass correction applied to the simplified solution closely approximates the full solution, highlighting that, to leading order, RT mixing is governed by the competing dynamics between diffusion of $\ln \bar{\rho}$ and mass conservation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and dynamics of axisymmetric thin liquid film flow along a conical surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the modeling and dynamics of gravity-driven, axisymmetric thin liquid film flow along a conical surface. Spatial linear stability analysis is performed on the basis of a Benney-type equation derived for the present configuration. In particular, streamwise curvature of the free surface is found to exert a crucial influence on the stability threshold. For simulations of surface waves, a second-order low-dimensional model is developed under the long-wave assumption, achieving accuracy comparable to direct numerical simulations at far lower cost. With this model, the characteristics of both linear and nonlinear waves are examined. A key difference from the flow over a flat plate is the dependence of wave dynamics on radial distance from the cone apex. At relatively high flow rates, a transition from solitary to sinusoidal waves is observed, with the transition position correlating closely with the linear stability threshold. Within the parameter range investigated, quantitative results of the conical film flow are almost identical to those in the flat-plate case when local parameters are substituted, indicating that inertial effects of the conical geometry are negligible. The models and findings presented in this paper may aid the design and optimization of industrial processes such as film coating and liquid-film-based heat and mass transfer on conical surfaces.</description>

      <title>Assessment of jet inflow conditions on the development of supersonic jet flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, large-eddy simulations of free supersonic jet flows are performed to investigate the influence of inflow conditions on the jet flow field and its turbulent properties. A high-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to solve the governing equations on the generated mesh. Three different inflow profiles are evaluated to represent the nozzle-exit conditions, namely, inviscid, steady viscous, and unsteady viscous profiles. Velocity and shear stress tensor component profiles obtained from the simulations are compared with experimental data. Among the investigated profiles, the steady viscous inflow shows the most significant deviation from the inviscid case, particularly in the near-field region of the jet inlet. The steady viscous profile also leads to reduced peak velocity fluctuations, showing better agreement with experimental results. Further downstream, the influence of the inflow condition diminishes, with all three profiles converging toward the experimental reference. In addition, power spectral density analyses of streamwise velocity fluctuations reveal that the inflow conditions have little effect on spectral distributions, with numerical results showing consistent agreement with experimental data within the accessible Strouhal range. Beyond these findings, the study provides a highly detailed, high-fidelity database of supersonic jet flow simulations, encompassing six large-eddy computations with different meshes, polynomial refinements, and inflow conditions. The database includes high-frequency data in relevant regions of the jet flow field and is openly available in the Zenodo repository, ensuring accessibility and reusability for the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of 3D Liquid Flow Fields in Additive Manufactured Structures for SMART Reactors Using Large-Scale Vertical Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures have emerged as a new class of porous materials with variable geometries and favourable transport properties, making them promising for reactor internals in chemical engineering. However, experimental data on internal TPMS flow behaviour are still limited. To address this gap, the flow behaviour in additively manufactured TPMS structures is analysed using three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) velocimetry in a large-bore vertical 3 T MRI system, in cylindrical columns of 38 mm diameter and Reynolds numbers between 50 and 300. Three different TPMS geometries are investigated, and consistency between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimentally measured MRI velocity fields is established through cross-validation. The MRI system provides fully three-dimensional velocity fields with a divergence deviation below 6 %. MRI revealed distinct flow features: the Gyroid TPnS exhibited pronounced channelling, while the Schwarz-Diamond TPSf showed merge-split behaviour, achieving a 46 % increase in lateral mixing compared to the Gyroid TPnS structures. Numerical simulations reproduce the flow features and show agreement with the MRI data. The combined methodology demonstrates the suitability of MRI velocimetry for the experimental validation of CFD simulations and establishes a robust foundation for future studies of heat and mass transfer, as well as reactive flow, in structured reactor systems.</description>

      <title>Wave Particle Turbulent Simulation of Spatially Developing Round Jets Using a Non Equilibrium Transport Model with a Mixing Length Characteristic Time Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the wave-particle turbulent simulation (WPTS), a recently developed multiscale, non-equilibrium turbulence modeling approach, is coupled with a turbulence characteristic-time closure derived from Prandtl mixing-length hypothesis and applied to spatially developing round jets. In WPTS, fluid elements in strongly turbulent regions are represented by Lagrangian particles that travel a finite distance before interacting with the background flow field represented in a wave-like (Eulerian) form. This mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the discrete fluid parcels invoked in the Prandtl mixing-length picture. WPTS differs from conventional mixing-length-based turbulence models in two key respects. First, particle evolution follows a non-equilibrium transport mechanism, rather than the equilibrium assumptions typically embedded in eddy-viscosity closures. Second, WPTS advances the wave and particle components in a coupled manner, with the particle fraction governed primarily by the modeled turbulence characteristic time, enabling laminar and turbulent regimes to be represented within a unified framework. Because spatially developing jets provide a canonical test case with well-established similarity behavior, they are used here for evaluation. Specifically, this work (1) develops a mixing-length-based characteristic-time model tailored to jet flows and (2) incorporates it into WPTS to assess predictive performance. The resulting WPTS framework accurately reproduces the jet similarity solution and other characteristic features at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 20,000, demonstrating the promise of WPTS as a practical tool for turbulence modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability and Structural Sensitivity of a Swirling Jet in a Francis Turbine Draft Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to better understand flow unsteadiness in hydraulic turbines, we perform a local linear stability and adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of the turbulent swirling jet at the outlet of a Francis turbine. We use measured mean flow and turbulence profiles at several operating conditions (below, at, and above the best efficiency point (BEP) flow rate) and perform a stability analysis. Incorporating eddy viscosity $\nu_t$ into the analysis strongly damps inviscid growth rates and restricts instability to low azimuthal modes $m\in [-1,2]$, in better agreement with experiments. Three turbulent viscosity closures (constant, mixing-length and measured $k-\varepsilon$ based) yield similar spectra, with close agreement between mixing length and measured models, all identify partial load (0.92 BEP) as the most unstable regime. Sensitivity results show that axial velocity modifications primarily control growth rates, whereas azimuthal velocity changes mainly shift frequencies. We also derive the sensitivity kernel of the spectrum to turbulent viscosity modifications and find that spatial variations of eddy viscosity are essential for predicting the unstable mode range. The predictions accurately estimate stability changes for small variations in operating point. We further analyze the flow using classical inviscid swirling jet instability criteria (the generalized Rayleigh discriminant) and WKB analysis to predict the stability to broader operating points and reconcile these results to the stability and sensitivity analyses. The approach used in this study is fast and simple to model, but it neglects draft tube geometry (non-parallel effects), motivating future global stability and sensitivity analyses.</description>

      <title>World without Viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity -- the internal friction of fluids -- is among the most consequential yet underappreciated properties in physics. This paper explores what would happen if viscosity vanished from all fluids while other material properties remained unchanged. The consequences are catastrophic and universal. Aircraft cannot generate lift because circulation around wings requires viscous action. Rotating machinery seizes without lubricating fluid films. Cardiovascular systems lose the resistance necessary for pressure regulation. Rivers become violent torrents, aquifers drain in hours, and storms persist indefinitely without frictional dissipation. The pedagogical value lies in illuminating viscosity's role providing resistance, damping, and control across all scales - from cellular interiors to planetary atmospheres. Evolution, engineering, and climate have exploited viscous dissipation for billions of years; its absence would render complex life impossible and Earth uninhabitable. By imagining a world without viscosity, we better understand the viscous world we inhabit.</description>

      <title>Fixed-grid sharp-interface numerical solutions to the three-phase spherical Stefan problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many metal manufacturing processes involve phase change phenomena, which include melting, boiling, and vaporization. These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2]. Lastly, we solve the three-phase Stefan problems numerically to demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy terms during phase change of smaller (nano) particles. In contrast, these effects diminish for large particles (microns and larger).</description>

      <title>Dynamics and universal scaling of Worthington jets in the cavity-free regime</title>

Abstract: Worthington jets ejected after the impact of a solid or liquid object on a liquid surface have extensive applications in natural, industrial, and scientific contexts. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the jet generated by sphere impact with no cavity formed. Experiments identify three distinct pinch-off modes, whose regime boundaries are independent of sphere wettability and density, and are theoretically determined by the Rayleigh--Plateau instability. From momentum and energy conservation, a new scaling law is derived for the dimensionless maximum jet height and agrees remarkably well with experiments across various impact conditions, thus validating its universal character and clarifying its dependence on the Froude, Weber, and Reynolds numbers as well as the density ratio. Coupling self-similar solutions with a kinematic condition at the jet tip yields good predictions for the evolution of jet height and shape, revealing gravity-dominated jet dynamics, with a modification from surface tension that is most pronounced without pinch-off. These findings demonstrate that the upward jet is sustained by the collision of converging flow behind the sphere, a generation mechanism fundamentally distinct from the cavity collapsing forced case.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Framework for Turbulent Systems</title>

Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems can be computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatiotemporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks, for spatial dimension reduction, with an innovative recurrent architecture, inspired by large language models, to model long-range temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Since RBC exhibits turbulent behavior, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key physical features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Real-time identification of parametric sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylindrical tank</title>

Abstract: Vertical forcing of partially filled tanks can induce parametric sloshing. Under non-isothermal conditions, the resulting mixing can disrupt the thermal stratification between liquid and vapor, leading to enhanced heat and mass transfer and large pressure fluctuations. This work presents an experimental investigation of sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylindrical tank under vertical harmonic excitation. This configuration is particularly relevant for cryogenic fuel storage in aircraft and ground transportation, yet its thermodynamic response under parametric sloshing remains largely uncharacterized. The present study provides the first experimental characterization of the sloshing-induced pressure drop and associated heat and mass transfer in this geometry. Decoupled isothermal and non-isothermal experimental campaigns are carried out across multiple fill levels and forcing amplitudes, near resonance of the first longitudinal symmetric mode $(2,0)$, using a hydrofluoroether fluid (3M Novec HFE-7000). To quantify heat and mass transfer, a lumped thermodynamic model is combined with an Augmented-state Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF), enabling real-time, time-resolved inference of Nusselt numbers. A critical forcing threshold is identified: below it, the fluid remains quiescent and thermally stratified; above it, parametric resonance drives strong sloshing, complete thermal destratification, and a rapid pressure drop. At 50% fill, the dominant (2,0) response intermittently alternates with a planar $(1,0)$ mode, indicating subharmonic mode interaction. The inferred Nusselt numbers increase by several orders of magnitude after destratification, and pressure-rate analysis confirms that condensation governs the pressure evolution.</description>
