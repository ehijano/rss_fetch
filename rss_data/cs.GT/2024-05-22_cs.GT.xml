      <title>The Power of Two in Token Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economies without monetary transfers, token systems serve as an alternative to sustain cooperation, alleviate free riding, and increase efficiency. This paper studies whether a token-based economy can be effective in marketplaces with thin exogenous supply. We consider a marketplace in which at each time period one agent requests a service, one agent provides the service, and one token (artificial currency) is used to pay for service provision. The number of tokens each agent has represents the difference between the amount of service provisions and service requests by the agent. We are interested in the behavior of this economy when very few agents are available to provide the requested service. Since balancing the number of tokens across agents is key to sustain cooperation, the agent with the minimum amount of tokens is selected to provide service among the available agents. When exactly one random agent is available to provide service, we show that the token distribution is unstable. However, already when just two random agents are available to provide service, the token distribution is stable, in the sense that agents' token balance is unlikely to deviate much from their initial endowment, and agents return to their initial endowment in finite expected time. Our results mirror the power of two choices paradigm in load balancing problems. Supported by numerical simulations using kidney exchange data, our findings suggest that token systems may generate efficient outcomes in kidney exchange marketplaces by sustaining cooperation between hospitals.</description>

      <title>A flow-based ascending auction to compute buyer-optimal Walrasian prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a market where a set of objects is sold to a set of buyers, each equipped with a valuation function for the objects. The goal of the auctioneer is to determine reasonable prices together with a stable allocation. One definition of "reasonable" and "stable" is a Walrasian equilibrium, which is a tuple consisting of a price vector together with an allocation satisfying the following desirable properties: (i) the allocation is market-clearing in the sense that as much as possible is sold, and (ii) the allocation is stable in the sense that every buyer ends up with an optimal set with respect to the given prices. Moreover, "buyer-optimal" means that the prices are smallest possible among all Walrasian prices.
  In this paper, we present a combinatorial network flow algorithm to compute buyer-optimal Walrasian prices in a multi-unit matching market with additive valuation functions and buyer demands. The algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the classical housing market auction and mimics the very natural procedure of an ascending auction. We use our structural insights to prove monotonicity of the buyer-optimal Walrasian prices with respect to changes in supply or demand.</description>

      <title>Strategy-Proof Auctions through Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auctions are key for maximizing sellers' revenue and ensuring truthful bidding among buyers. Recently, an approach known as differentiable economics based on deep learning shows promise in learning optimal auction mechanisms for multiple items and participants. However, this approach has no guarantee of strategy-proofness at test time. Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures that buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal and fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. Building on conformal prediction, we introduce a novel approach to achieve strategy-proofness with rigorous statistical guarantees. The key novelties of our method are: (i) the formulation of a regret prediction model, used to quantify at test time violations of strategy-proofness; and (ii) an auction acceptance rule that leverages the predicted regret to ensure that for a new auction, the data-driven mechanism meets the strategy-proofness requirement with high probability (e.g., 99\%). Numerical experiments demonstrate the necessity for rigorous guarantees, the validity of our theoretical results, and the applicability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Data as voters: instance selection using approval-based multi-winner voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the instance selection problem in machine learning (or data mining). Our approach is based on recent results on (proportional) representation in approval-based multi-winner elections. In our model, instances play a double role as voters and candidates. The approval set of each instance in the training set (acting as a voter) is defined from the concept of local set, which already exists in the literature. We then select the election winners by using a representative voting rule, and such winners are the data instances kept in the reduced training set. Our experiments show that, for KNN, the rule Simple 2-EJR (a variant of the Simple EJR voting rule that satisfies 2-EJR) outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms and all the baselines that we consider in this paper in terms of accuracy vs reduction. For SVMs, we have obtained slight increases in the average accuracy by using several voting rules that satisfy EJR or PJR compared to the results obtained with the original datasets.</description>

      <title>RetinaRegNet: A Versatile Approach for Retinal Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RetinaRegNet model, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various retinal image registration tasks. RetinaRegNet does not require training on any retinal images. It begins by establishing point correspondences between two retinal images using image features derived from diffusion models. This process involves the selection of feature points from the moving image using the SIFT algorithm alongside random point sampling. For each selected feature point, a 2D correlation map is computed by assessing the similarity between the feature vector at that point and the feature vectors of all pixels in the fixed image. The pixel with the highest similarity score in the correlation map corresponds to the feature point in the moving image. To remove outliers in the estimated point correspondences, we first applied an inverse consistency constraint, followed by a transformation-based outlier detector. This method proved to outperform the widely used random sample consensus (RANSAC) outlier detector by a significant margin. To handle large deformations, we utilized a two-stage image registration framework. A homography transformation was used in the first stage and a more accurate third-order polynomial transformation was used in the second stage. The model's effectiveness was demonstrated across three retinal image datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. RetinaRegNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in all three datasets. It was especially effective for registering image pairs with large displacement and scaling deformations. This innovation holds promise for various applications in retinal image analysis. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet .</description>
