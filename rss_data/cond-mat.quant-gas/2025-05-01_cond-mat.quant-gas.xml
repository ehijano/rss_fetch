      <title>Anyonization of bosons in one dimension: an effective swap model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyons emerge as elementary excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems and exhibit behavior distinct from bosons or fermions. Previous models of anyons in one dimension (1D) are mainly categorized into two types: those that rely on nontrivial scattering behavior, and those based on density-dependent hopping processes in discrete lattices. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a "swap" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as "host particles" and "impurities". The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. For a single impurity, our swap model can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., arXiv:2412.21131]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities. Our work provides new avenues for engineering many-body anyonic behavior in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate universal few-body bound states in microwave-shielded ultracold polar molecules. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the tetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic state, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies and spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems. Universal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of effective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective potential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of pairing in imbalanced three-component one-dimensional Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional, three-component Fermi gas with population imbalance using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We specifically consider pairing in two channels while deliberately excluding the third by setting its interaction strength to zero. By systematically varying the interaction strength and population imbalance, we identify a rich set of spatially modulated superfluid states, including structures akin to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase and phase-separated domains. A clear hierarchy emerges in the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of states and the Fermi momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the density further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial reorganizations. Our results shed light on how pairing symmetry and population imbalance determine the structure of spatially inhomogeneous superfluid phases in multicomponent systems with reduced dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling law for quantum droplet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the right set of circumstances, ultracold quantum gases are able to change character and condense into a liquid state of quantum droplets. The size distribution of the droplets is determined dynamically in the condensation process. A semi-quantitative argument is presented which suggests that, at zero temperature, a multiple droplet system has is a preferred scale $\propto v^{-d}$, with $d\approx 0.5$, where $v$ is the rate of change of parameters at the time of droplet formation. Numerical simulations of two dimensional systems strongly support a power law, but with an exponent $d\in(0.3,0.4)$.</description>

      <title>A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</description>

      <title>Kelvin-Wave-Inspired Optical Vortex Excitation in Kerr Nonlinear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.</description>

      <title>Observation of Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking. This time crystal phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced time crystal is closer to the idea of crystal, compared to other time crystal realizations.</description>
