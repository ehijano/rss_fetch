      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we establish how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands not seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is important for receptor co-specificity, in contrast with the hydrophobic properties that more prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. We furthermore find that positions not in direct contact with the peptide still significantly impact specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Protein Language Models for Function Prediction and Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have shown promise in improving the understanding of protein sequences, contributing to advances in areas such as function prediction and protein engineering. However, training these models from scratch requires significant computational resources, limiting their accessibility. To address this, we integrate a PLM into DeepChem, an open-source framework for computational biology and chemistry, to provide a more accessible platform for protein-related tasks.
  We evaluate the performance of the integrated model on various protein prediction tasks, showing that it achieves reasonable results across benchmarks. Additionally, we present an exploration of generating plastic-degrading enzyme candidates using the model's embeddings and latent space manipulation techniques. While the results suggest that further refinement is needed, this approach provides a foundation for future work in enzyme design. This study aims to facilitate the use of PLMs in research fields like synthetic biology and environmental sustainability, even for those with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Length-dependent residence time of contacts in simple polymeric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the reported experimental evidence that the residence time of contacts between the ends of biopolymers is length dependent, we investigate the kinetics of contact breaking in simple polymer models from a theoretical point of view. We solved Kramers equation first for an ideal chain and then for a polymer with attracting ends, and compared the predictions with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the mean residence time always shows a power--law dependence on the length of the polymer with exponent $-1$, although is significantly smaller when obtained from the analysis of a single trajectory than when calculated from independent initial conformations. Only when the interaction is strong (&gt;&gt;kT) and the interaction range is small (of the order of the distance between consecutive monomers) does the residence time converge to that of the Arrhenius equation, independent of the length. We are able to provide expressions of the mean residence time for cases when the exact definition of contact is not available a priori, expressions that can be useful in typical cases of microscopy experiments.</description>
