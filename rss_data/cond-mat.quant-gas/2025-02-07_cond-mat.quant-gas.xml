      <title>Shortcuts to Analog Preparation of Non-Equilibrium Quantum Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the weakly interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Modeling the laser-pulse induced helium trimer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by ongoing pump-probe spectroscopy experiments, this work develops a theoretical framework for describing the rovibrational wave packet dynamics that ensues when a single weakly-bound van der Waals trimer is exposed to a short, sub-picosecond linearly polarized pump laser pulse. The intensity I of the pump laser is chosen such that excitation and ionization of the electronic degrees of freedom are negligible while excitation of the wavepacket in the nuclear degrees of freedom is non-negligible. The numerical treatment, which takes advantage of the fact that the laser pulse is very short compared to typical molecular time scales, is based on a wave packet decomposition that utilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The framework is applied to the extremely floppy bosonic helium trimer. A convergence analysis of the partial wave decomposition is conducted. The kinetic energy release and orientation dynamics are presented. While the dynamics of more strongly-bound van der Waals trimers such as, e.g., the argon trimer display negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture appropriate, those of weakly-bound trimers display non-negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture inappropriate. It is shown that a model that constructs the helium trimer dynamics from the dynamics of the helium dimer captures a number of key characteristics of the alignment signal, including the interference between different angular momentum wave packet components.</description>

      <title>Geometrical frustration, power law tunneling and non-local gauge fields from scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Volume-entangled exact scar states in the PXP and related models in any dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.</description>

      <title>Polaronic neutron in dilute alpha matter: A $p$-wave Bose polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quasiparticle properties of a neutron immersed in an alpha condensate, which is one of the possible states of dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The resonant $p$-wave neutron-alpha scattering, which plays a crucial role in forming halo nuclei, is considered. This system is similar to a Bose polaron near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance that can be realized in cold-atomic experiments. Calculating the self-energy within the field-theoretical approach, we give an analytical formula for the effective mass of a polaronic neutron as a function of alpha condensation density. Moreover, two adjacent neutrons in a medium, each of which behaves like a stable polaron having an enhanced effective mass, can form a bound dineutron, with the help of $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron attraction. This is in contrast to the case of the vacuum, where a dineutron is known to be unbound. Our result would be useful for understanding many-body physics in astrophysical environments as well as the formation of multi-nucleon clusters in neutron-halo nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian disordered fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions. The change in the eigenspectrum with tunning boundary parameter is intimately connected to the non-Hermitian skin effect. The single-particle systems are affected by the boundary perturbations; however the interplay of a random disorder potential and non-reciprocal hopping under boundary perturbations of an interacting many-body system is not yet clear. In this work, we examine the boundary sensitivity of a non-Hermitian interacting fermionic system in the presence of a random disorder potential. A non-zero boundary parameter results in real-complex spectral transitions with non-reciprocal (or unidirectional) hopping at weak disorder. While the many-body localization at strong disorder washes away real-complex transitions leading to dynamical stability and real eigenvalue spectrum. We show that the boundary-driven real-complex spectral transitions of the non-Hermitian chain are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the level statistics and nearest level-spacing distributions. The intriguing features of non-reciprocity and boundary sensitivity are further revealed using the averaged inverse participation ratios. Finally, we find distinct behaviour in the quench dynamics of local particle density, population imbalance, and entanglement entropy of charge-density-wave ordered state that corroborate the real-complex and localization transitions. Our results provide a route to understanding disordered many-body systems under a generalized boundary.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>
