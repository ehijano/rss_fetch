      <description>arXiv:2505.17486v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Universal geometrical link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non-semi simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants. The geometrical origin of our construction provides a new topological perspective for the study of the asymptotics of these (non) semi-simple invariants, for which a purely topological $3$-dimensional description is a deep problem in quantum topology. Since our models are defined for links they open avenues for constructing universal invariants for three manifolds unifying the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and the Costantino-Geer-Patureau invariants through purely geometrical lenses.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Lie foliations with locally symmetric leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if the leaves of a minimal Lie foliation are locally isometric to a symmetric space of non-compact type without a Poincare disk factor, then the foliation is smoothly conjugate to a homogeneous Lie foliation up to finite covering. This result generalizes and strengthens Zimmer's theorem, which characterizes minimal Lie foliations with leaves isometric to a symmetric space of non-compact type without real rank one factors as pullbacks of homogeneous foliations. As applications, we extend Zimmer's arithmeticity theorem for holonomy groups and establish a rigidity theorem for Riemannian foliations with locally symmetric leaves.</description>

      <title>On ratios of Chern numbers for complex hyperbolic branched covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that, at least in even complex dimensions, the ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic branched cover manifold are not all equal to the corresponding ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic manifold. This leads to an answer for a question posed by Deraux and Seshadri, and proves that an almost $1/4$-pinched metric constructed by the author in a previous article is not K\"{a}hler.</description>

      <title>Virtual Knotoids in Thickened Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometric interpretation of virtual knotoids as arcs in thickened surfaces. Then we show that virtual knotoid theory is a generalization of classical knotoid theory. This gives a proof of a conjecture of Kauffman and the first author.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Solutions of the Haydys-Witten Equations and Symplectic Khovanov Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An influential conjecture by Witten states that there is an instanton Floer homology of four-manifolds with corners that in certain situations is isomorphic to Khovanov homology of a given knot $K$. The Floer chain complex is generated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular behaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$. The Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an additional flow direction $\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions of a decoupled version of the Kapustin-Witten and Haydys-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}_s \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to the full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed as a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five dimensions. Inspired by Gaiotto-Witten's approach of adiabatically braiding EBE-solutions to obtain generators of the Floer homology, we propose that there is an equivalence between adiabatic solutions of the decoupled Haydys-Witten equations and non-vertical paths in the moduli space of EBE-solutions fibered over the space of monopole positions. Moreover, we argue that the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the Lie algebra of the gauge group provides a finite-dimensional model of this moduli space of monopole solutions. These considerations suggest an intriguing similarity between Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology and symplectic Khovanov homology and provide a novel approach towards a proof of Witten's gauge-theoretic interpretations of Khovanov homology.</description>
