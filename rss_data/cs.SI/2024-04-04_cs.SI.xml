      <title>A Holistic Indicator of Polarization to Measure Online Sexism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online trend of the manosphere and feminist discourse on social networks requires a holistic measure of the level of sexism in an online community. This indicator is important for policymakers and moderators of online communities (e.g., subreddits) and computational social scientists, either to revise moderation strategies based on the degree of sexism or to match and compare the temporal sexism across different platforms and communities with real-time events and infer social scientific insights.
  In this paper, we build a model that can provide a comparable holistic indicator of toxicity targeted toward male and female identity and male and female individuals. Despite previous supervised NLP methods that require annotation of toxic comments at the target level (e.g. annotating comments that are specifically toxic toward women) to detect targeted toxic comments, our indicator uses supervised NLP to detect the presence of toxicity and unsupervised word embedding association test to detect the target automatically.
  We apply our model to gender discourse communities (e.g., r/TheRedPill, r/MGTOW, r/FemaleDatingStrategy) to detect the level of toxicity toward genders (i.e., sexism). Our results show that our framework accurately and consistently (93% correlation) measures the level of sexism in a community. We finally discuss how our framework can be generalized in the future to measure qualities other than toxicity (e.g. sentiment, humor) toward general-purpose targets and turn into an indicator of different sorts of polarizations.</description>

      <title>Why do people think liberals drink lattes? How social media afforded self-presentation can shape subjective social sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social sorting, the alignment of social identities, affiliations, and/or preferences with partisan groups, can increase in-party attachment and decrease out-party tolerance. We propose that self-presentation afforded by social media profiles fosters subjective social sorting by shaping perceptions of alignments between non-political and political identifiers. Unlike previous work, we evaluate social sorting of naturally occurring, public-facing identifiers in social media profiles selected using a bottom-up approach. Using a sample of 50 million X users collected five times between 2016 and 2018, we identify users who define themselves politically and generate networks representing simultaneous co-occurrence of identifiers in profiles. We then systematically measure the alignment of non-political identifiers along political dimensions, revealing alignments that reinforce existing associations, reveal unexpected relationships, and reflect online and offline events. We find that while most identifiers bridge political divides, social sorting of identifiers along political lines is occurring to some degree in X profiles. Our results have implications for understanding the role of social media in facilitating (the perception of) polarization and polarization mitigation strategies such as bridging interventions and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Correlation Patterns in the Ethereum Validator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several studies into measuring the level of decentralization in Ethereum through applying various indices to indicate the relative dominance of entities in different domains in the ecosystem. However, these indices do not capture any correlation between those different entities, that could potentially make them the subject of external coercion, or covert collusion. We propose an index that measures the relative dominance of entities based on the application of correlation factors. We posit that this approach produces a more nuanced and accurate index of decentralization.</description>

      <title>Exploring Urban Mobility Trends using Cellular Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of urban areas intensifies the need for sustainable, efficient transportation infrastructure and mobility systems, driving initiatives to enhance infrastructure and public transport while reducing congestion and emissions. By utilizing real-world mobility data, a data-driven approach can provide crucial insights for planning and decision-making.
  This study explores the efficacy of leveraging telecoms data from cellular network signals for studying crowd movement patterns, focusing on Trondheim, Norway. It examines routing reports to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of various transportation routes and modes.
  A data preprocessing and feature engineering framework was developed to process raw routing reports for historical analysis. This enabled the examination of geospatial trends and temporal patterns, including a comparative analysis of various transportation modes, along with public transit usage. Specific routes and areas were analyzed in-depth to compare their mobility patterns with the broader city context.
  The study highlights the potential of cellular network data as a resource for shaping urban transportation and mobility systems. By identifying deficiencies and potential improvements, city planners and stakeholders can foster more sustainable and effective transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>RAT: Retrieval-Augmented Transformer for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting click-through rates (CTR) is a fundamental task for Web applications, where a key issue is to devise effective models for feature interactions. Current methodologies predominantly concentrate on modeling feature interactions within an individual sample, while overlooking the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as a reference context to enhance the prediction. To make up for such deficiency, this paper develops a Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (RAT), aiming to acquire fine-grained feature interactions within and across samples. By retrieving similar samples, we construct augmented input for each target sample. We then build Transformer layers with cascaded attention to capture both intra- and cross-sample feature interactions, facilitating comprehensive reasoning for improved CTR prediction while retaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of RAT and suggest its advantage in long-tail scenarios. The code has been open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/YushenLi807/WWW24-RAT}.</description>

      <title>Automated Transparency: A Legal and Empirical Analysis of the Digital Services Act Transparency Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a much awaited platforms liability reform in the European Union that was adopted on 1 November 2022 with the ambition to set a global example in terms of accountability and transparency. Among other obligations, the DSA emphasizes the need for online platforms to report on their content moderation decisions (`statements of reasons' - SoRs), which is a novel transparency mechanism we refer to as automated transparency in this study. SoRs are currently made available in the DSA Transparency Database, launched by the European Commission in September 2023. The DSA Transparency Database marks a historical achievement in platform governance, and allows investigations about the actual transparency gains, both at structure level as well as at the level of platform compliance. This study aims to understand whether the Transparency Database helps the DSA to live up to its transparency promises. We use legal and empirical arguments to show that while there are some transparency gains, compliance remains problematic, as the current database structure allows for a lot of discretion from platforms in terms of transparency practices. In our empirical study, we analyze a representative sample of the Transparency Database (131m SoRs) submitted in November 2023, to characterise and evaluate platform content moderation practices.</description>

      <title>A tensor factorization model of multilayer network interdependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer networks describe the rich ways in which nodes are related by accounting for different relationships in separate layers. These multiple relationships are naturally represented by an adjacency tensor. In this work we study the use of the nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NNTuck) of such tensors under a KL loss as an expressive factor model that naturally generalizes existing stochastic block models of multilayer networks. Quantifying interdependencies between layers can identify redundancies in the structure of a network, indicate relationships between disparate layers, and potentially inform survey instruments for collecting social network data. We propose definitions of layer independence, dependence, and redundancy based on likelihood ratio tests between nested nonnegative Tucker decompositions. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we evaluate the use and interpretation of the NNTuck as a model of multilayer networks. Algorithmically, we show that using expectation maximization (EM) to maximize the log-likelihood under the NNTuck is step-by-step equivalent to tensorial multiplicative updates for the NNTuck under a KL loss, extending a previously known equivalence from nonnegative matrices to nonnegative tensors.</description>

      <title>HyperGraphDis: Leveraging Hypergraphs for Contextual and Social-Based Disinformation Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the growing impact of disinformation on social, economic, and political landscapes, accurate and efficient identification methods are increasingly critical. This paper introduces HyperGraphDis, a novel approach for detecting disinformation on Twitter that employs a hypergraph-based representation to capture (i) the intricate social structures arising from retweet cascades, (ii) relational features among users, and (iii) semantic and topical nuances. Evaluated on four Twitter datasets -- focusing on the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic -- HyperGraphDis outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring its effectiveness and scalability for tackling the challenges posed by disinformation dissemination. HyperGraphDis displays exceptional performance on a COVID-19-related dataset, achieving an impressive F1 score (weighted) of approximately 89.5%. This result represents a notable improvement of around 4% compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, significant enhancements in computation time are observed for both model training and inference. In terms of model training, completion times are accelerated by a factor ranging from 2.3 to 7.6 compared to the second-best method across the four datasets. Similarly, during inference, computation times are 1.3 to 6.8 times faster than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Non-coresident family as a driver of migration change in a crisis: The case of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changes in U.S. migration during the COVID-19 pandemic show that many moved to less populated cities from larger cities, deviating from previous trends. In this study, building on prior work in the literature showing that the abundance of family ties is inversely related to population size, we analyze these migration changes with a focus on the crucial, yet overlooked factor of extended family. Employing two large-scale data sets, census microdata and mobile phone GPS relocation data, we show a collection of empirical results that paints a picture of migration change affected by kin. Namely, we find that people migrated closer to family at higher rates after the COVID-19 pandemic started. Moreover, even controlling for factors such as population density and cost of living, we find that changes in net in-migration tended to be larger and positive in cities with larger proportions of people who can be parents to adult children (our proxy for parental family availability, which is also inversely related to population size). Our study advances the demography-disaster nexus and amplifies ongoing literature highlighting the role of broader kinship systems in large-scale socioeconomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Graph Generation through Iterative Local Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of generative models for graphs, extensive research has been conducted. However, most existing methods struggle with large graphs due to the complexity of representing the entire joint distribution across all node pairs and capturing both global and local graph structures simultaneously. To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity through multiscale generation. Our experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-established benchmark datasets while successfully scaling to graphs with at least 5000 nodes. Our method is also the first to successfully extrapolate to graphs outside of the training distribution, showcasing a much better generalization capability over existing methods.</description>
