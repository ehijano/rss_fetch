      <title>Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface: Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes using a geometric Hamiltonian approach to the Schr\"odinger-like representation. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools.
  The mathematical aspects of Gaussian integration theory in infinite-dimensional Topological Vector Spaces (TVS) are thoroughly reviewed. It also reviews the complex and holomorphic versions of important results and concepts of Gaussian integration. For example, the Wiener-It\^o decomposition theorem or the definition of Hida test functions.
  The physical framework builds upon three interconnected levels: classical General Relativity (GR), Classical Statistical Field Theory (CSFT), and QFT. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove (KvH) formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. This description is based upon prequantization theory. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.
  Upon the prequantum program, the QFT of the scalar field is built mixing Geometric Quantization with the choice of Wick and Weyl orderings. Various quantum representations are introduced: the holomorphic, Schr\"odinger, field-momentum, and antiholomorphic. The relation among them is studied using integral transforms, including novel infinite-dimensional Fourier transforms. From a geometrical analysis, it is argued that a covariant time derivative that modifies the evolution equations should be added to the Schr\"odinger equation. This connection is unique and required by the geometrodynamical description ofthe coupling of QFT and GR.
  Finally, studying the free model on cosmological spacetimes it obtains particle creation effects on a dynamical equation.</description>

      <title>The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices. The infinite matrices in idMPS give rise to operators acting on (possibly infinite-dimensional) auxiliary Hilbert spaces. As an example we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Weighing the curvature invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities, as well as asymptotic properties of spacetimes. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors, independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>The elliptic lattice KdV system revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper [Nijhoff,Puttock,2003], a 2-parameter extension of the lattice potential KdV equation was derived, associated with an elliptic curve. This comprises a rather complicated 3-component system on the quad lattice which contains the moduli of the elliptic curve as parameters. In the present paper, we investigate this system further and, among other results, we derive a 2-component multiquartic form of the system on the quad lattice. Furthermore, we construct an elliptic Yang-Baxter map, and study the associated continuous and semi-discrete systems. In particular, we derive the so-called ``generating PDE'' for this system, comprising a 6-component system of second order PDEs which could be considered to constitute an elliptic extension of the Ernst equations of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the rod cross section shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct method for solving the inverse problem of determining the shape of the cross section of a rod is proposed. The method is based on Neumann series of Bessel functions representations for solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations. The first coefficient of the representation is sufficient for the recovery of the unknown function. A system of linear algebraic equations for finding this coefficient is obtained. The proposed method leads to an efficient numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product States as Observations of Entangled Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reveals the intrinsic structure of Matrix Product States (MPS) by establishing their deep connection to entangled hidden Markov models (EHMMs). It is demonstrated that a significant class of MPS can be derived as the outcomes of EHMMs, showcasing their underlying quantum correlations. Additionally, a lower bound is derived for the relative entropy between the EHMM-observation process and the corresponding MPS, providing a quantitative measure of their informational divergence. Conversely, it is shown that every MPS is naturally associated with an EHMM, further highlighting the interplay between these frameworks. These results are supported by illustrative examples from quantum information, emphasizing their importance in understanding entanglement, quantum correlations, and tensor network representations.</description>

      <title>Thermal time of noncommutative Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermal time hypothesis of arXiv:gr-qc/9406019 in the context of noncommutative deformations of Minkowski. We show that a natural modular group arises from the modular function of the momentum space. In the specific case of $\kappa$-Minkowski, we show that this thermal time flow corresponds to the globally defined time coordinate translation. On the other hand, the absence of thermal time for $\rho$-Minkowski is directly related to the discreteness of its global time. The impact of inner automorphism transformation on the physics and the treatment of unimodular case (unthermalised spacetimes) are discussed. Moreover, a reflection on the use of thermal field theory for quantum gravity phenomenology is put forward, as we just bridged thermal spacetimes with $\kappa$-Minkowski, often considered a "flat limit" of a quantum gravity candidate theory.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations in first-passage percolation for bounded weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moderate and large deviations in first-passage percolation (FPP) with bounded weights on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. Write $T(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ for the first-passage time and denote by $\mu(\mathbf{u})$ the time constant in direction $\mathbf{u}$. In this paper, we establish that, if one assumes that the sublinear error term $T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) - N\mu(\mathbf{u})$ is of order $N^\chi$, then under some unverified (but widely believed) assumptions, for $\chi &lt; a &lt; 1$, \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &gt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) + N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{d(1+o(1))}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)},
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &lt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) - N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{1+o(1)}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)}, \end{align*} with accompanying estimates in the borderline case $a=1$. Moreover, the exponents $\frac{d}{1-\chi}$ and $\frac{1}{1-\chi}$ also appear in the asymptotic behavior near $0$ of the rate functions for upper and lower tail large deviations. Notably, some of our estimates are established rigorously without relying on any unverified assumptions. Our main results highlight the interplay between fluctuations and the decay rates of large deviations, and bridge the gap between these two regimes.
  A key ingredient of our proof is an improved concentration via multi-scale analysis for several moderate deviation estimates, a phenomenon that has previously appeared in the contexts of two-dimensional last-passage percolation and two-dimensional rotationally invariant FPP.</description>

      <title>Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.
  In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits. In: Active Particles, Volume 2, 2019) in the microscopic setting.</description>

      <title>General soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation via the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with various soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation, as well as to the Sasa-Satsuma equation which can be viewed as one reduction case of the coupled Hirota equation. First, we derive bright-bright, dark-dark, and bright-dark soliton solutions of the coupled Hirota equation by using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction method. Then, we present the bright and dark soliton solutions to the Sasa-Satsuma equation which are expressed by determinants of $N \times N$ instead of $2N \times 2N$ in the literature. The dynamics of first-, second-order solutions are investigated in detail. It is intriguing that, for the SS equation, the bright soliton for \(N=1\) is also the soliton to the complex mKdV equation while the amplitude and velocity of dark soliton for \(N=1\) are determined by the background plane wave. For \(N=2\), the bright soliton can be classified into three types: oscillating, single-hump, and two-hump ones while the dark soliton can be classified into five types: dark (single-hole), anti-dark, Mexican hat, anti-Mexican hat and double-hole. Moreover, the types of bright solitons for the Sasa-Satsuma equation can be changed due to collision.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Nonlinear Stability of Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Riesz Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\"onwall type estimate is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential. Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing concentration compactness arguments. Steady states properties are obtained by variational arguments connecting to recent advances in aggregation-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>Deformations in spinor bundles: Lorentz violation and further physical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the deformation of spinor structures within nontrivial topologies and their physical implications. The deformation is modeled by introducing real functions that modify the standard spinor dynamics, leading to distinct physical regions characterized by varying degrees of Lorentz symmetry violation. It allows us to investigate the effects in the dynamical equation and a geometrized nonlinear sigma model. The findings suggest significant implications for the spinor fields in regions with nontrivial topologies, providing a robust mathematical approach to studying exotic spinor behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography from the evolution of a single expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of performing full quantum tomography based on the homogeneous time evolution of a single expectation value. Remarkably, every non-trivial binary measurement evolved by any quantum channel, except for a null set, in principle enables full quantum state tomography. We show that this remains true when restricted to Lindblad semigroups, although unitary evolution -- even with added simply depolarizing noise -- is insufficient beyond the qubit case, highlighting the necessity of non-trivial noise. We establish an analog of Takens' embedding theorem for quantum channels, which incorporates prior information into the framework. We also provide estimation bounds for finite statistics and analyze the feasibility of recovering an infinite time series of expectation values from a finite one using only spectral properties of the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1112.6375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetic response of hollow semimetal cylinders and rings to the presence of an axial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux, in the absence of interactions. We predict nullification of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a class of dispersion laws that includes "non-relativistic" dispersion and demonstrate that at zero flux the ground-state of a very short "armchair" graphene tube will exhibit a ferromagnetic broken symmetry. We also compute the diamagnetic response of bulk semimetals to the presence of a uniform magnetic field, specifically predicting that the susceptibility has a logarithmic dependence on the size of the sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of optical geometry, defined to be a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a null line distribution, from the perspective of intrinsic torsion. This is an instance of a non-integrable version of holonomy reduction in Lorentzian geometry. These generate congruences of null curves, which play an important r\^{o}le in general relativity. Conformal properties of these are investigated. We also extend this concept to generalised optical geometries as introduced by Robinson and Trautman.</description>

      <title>Hidden Wave Function of Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Flat Band as a Landau Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.02915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the chirally symmetric continuum model (CS-CM) of the twisted bilayer graphene. The equation on a flat band could be interpreted as a Dirac equation on a torus in the external non-abelian magnetic field. We prove that the existence of the flat band implies that the wave-function has a zero and vice verse. We found a hidden solution in the CS-CM model that has a pole instead of a zero. Our main result is that in the basis of the flat band and hidden wave functions the flat band could be interpreted as Landau level in the external magnetic field. From that interpretation we show the existence of extra flat bands in the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Non-orthogonal eigenvectors, fluctuation-dissipation relations and entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) linking the response function to time dependent correlations of observables measured in the reference unperturbed state is one of the central results in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Letter we discuss an extension of the standard FDT to the case when multidimensional matrix representing transition probabilities is strictly non-normal. This feature dramatically modifies the dynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvector nonorthogonality via the associated overlap matrix of Chalker-Mehlig type. In particular, the rate of entropy production per unit time is strongly enhanced by that matrix. We suggest, that this mechanism has an impact on the studies of collective phenomena in neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such phenomena as synchronization and emergence of the memory. We also expect, that the described mechanism generating the entropy production is generic for wide class of phenomena, where dynamics is driven by non-normal operators. For the case of driving by a large Ginibre matrix the entropy production rate is evaluated analytically, as well as for the Rajan-Abbott model for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Lie-Poisson discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a structure preserving spatio-temporal discretization for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on the sphere. Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model towards the quantum chaos transition conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider $D$ random systems that are modeled by independent $N\times N$ complex Hermitian Wigner matrices. Suppose they are lying on a circle and the neighboring systems interact with each other through a deterministic matrix $A$. We prove that in the asymptotic limit $N\to \infty$, the whole system exhibits a quantum chaos transition when the interaction strength $\|A\|_{HS}$ varies. Specifically, when $\|A\|_{HS}\ge N^{\varepsilon}$, we prove that the bulk eigenvalue statistics match those of a $DN\times DN$ GUE asymptotically and each bulk eigenvector is approximately equally distributed among the $D$ subsystems with probability $1-o(1)$. These phenomena indicate quantum chaos of the whole system. In contrast, when $\|A\|_{HS}\le N^{-\varepsilon}$, we show that the system is integrable: the bulk eigenvalue statistics behave like $D$ independent copies of GUE statistics asymptotically and each bulk eigenvector is localized on only one subsystem. In particular, if we take $D\to \infty$ after the $N\to \infty$ limit, the bulk statistics converge to a Poisson point process under the $DN$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomalies for (maximal) 6d conformal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <title>Improved $L^\infty$ bounds for eigenfunctions under random perturbations in negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatics, Pentagon Equations, and Hexagon Equations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4 (i.e., 3+1) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We discover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions and any violations indicate a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and the study of non-invertible symmetries and symmetry topological field theories in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a double shifted power analog of free fermion fields to introduce current operators, Hamiltonians, and vertex operators which are deformed by two families of parameters and satisfy analogous formulas to the classical case. We show that the deformed half vertex operators correspond to the row transfer matrices of a solvable six vertex model recently given by Naprienko [arXiv:2301.12110], which under a specialization yields the factorial Schur functions (up to a reindexing of parameters). As a consequence, we show that under the boson-fermion correspondence using our deformed half vertex operators, the natural basis (under this specialization) maps to the double factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, the image of the natural basis vectors are tau function solutions to the 2D Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions to all orders in fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>
