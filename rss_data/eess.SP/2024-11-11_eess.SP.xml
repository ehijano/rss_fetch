      <title>Cooperative Maximum Likelihood Target Position Estimation for MIMO-ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates target position estimation in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) networks composed of multiple cooperating monostatic base stations (BSs). Each BS employs a MIMO-orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) scheme, enabling the coexistence of communication and sensing. A general cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) framework is derived, directly estimating the target position in a common reference system rather than relying on local range and angle estimates at each BS. Positioning accuracy is evaluated in single-target scenarios by varying the number of collaborating BSs, using root mean square error (RMSE), and comparing against the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound. Numerical results demonstrate that the ML framework significantly reduces the position RMSE as the number of cooperating BSs increases.</description>

      <title>Integrated Location Sensing and Communication for Ultra-Massive MIMO With Hybrid-Field Beam-Squint Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple output systems holds great promise for next-generation communications, yet their channels exhibit hybrid far- and near- field beam-squint (HFBS) effect. In this paper, we not only overcome but also harness the HFBS effect to propose an integrated location sensing and communication (ILSC) framework. During the uplink training stage, user terminals (UTs) transmit reference signals for simultaneous channel estimation and location sensing. This stage leverages an elaborately designed hybrid-field projection matrix to overcome the HFBS effect and estimate the channel in compressive manner. Subsequently, the scatterers' locations can be sensed from the spherical wavefront based on the channel estimation results. By treating the sensed scatterers as virtual anchors, we employ a weighted least-squares approach to derive UT' s location. Moreover, we propose an iterative refinement mechanism, which utilizes the accurately estimated time difference of arrival of multipath components to enhance location sensing precision. In the following downlink data transmission stage, we leverage the acquired location information to further optimize the hybrid beamformer, which combines the beam broadening and focusing to mitigate the spectral efficiency degradation resulted from the HFBS effect. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed ILSC scheme has superior location sensing and communication performance than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoding with Per-Beam Timing Advance for Asynchronous Cell-free mmWave Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is regarded as one of the promising technologies for next-generation wireless networks. However, due to its distributed architecture, geographically separated access points (APs) jointly serve a large number of user-equipments (UEs), there will inevitably be a discrepancies in the arrival time of transmitted signals. In this paper, we investigate millimeter-wave (mmWave) CF-mMIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with asynchronous reception in a wide area coverage scenario, where asynchronous timing offsets may extend far beyond the cyclic prefix (CP) range. A comprehensive asynchronous beam-domain signal transmission model is presented for mmWave CF-mMIMO-OFDM systems in both downlink and uplink, incorporating phase offset, inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). To address the issue of asynchronous reception, we propose a novel per-beam timing advance (PBTA) hybrid precoding architecture and analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) in the beam domain for downlink and uplink asynchronous receptions. Both scalable centralized and distributed implementations are taken into account, and the asynchronous delay phase is utilized to design precoding/combining vectors. Furthermore, we formulate the sum rate maximization problem and develop two low-complexity joint beam selection and UE association algorithms considering the impact of asynchronous timing offset exceeding the CP range. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance will be severely limited by ICI and ISI, and our proposed PBTA hybrid precoding architecture effectively mitigates asynchronous interference compared to the nearest AAU/UE-based timing-advance scheme. Additionally, numerical results show that our proposed low-complexity joint beam selection and UE association algorithms achieve superior SE performance.</description>

      <title>Privacy Protection Framework against Unauthorized Sensing in the 5.8 GHz ISM Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unauthorized sensing activities pose an increasing threat to individual privacy, particularly in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band where regulatory frameworks remain limited. This paper presents a novel signal process methodology to monitor and counter unauthorized sensing activities. Specifically, we model the pedestrian trajectories as a random process. Then, we leverage the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) to evaluate sensing performance and model it as sampling error of such a random process. Through simulation, we verify the accuracy of monitoring unauthorized sensing activities in urban scenarios, and validate the effectiveness of corresponding mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Single-Collision Model for Non-Line-of-Sight UV Communication Channel With Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research on non-line-of-sight (NLoS) ultraviolet (UV) channel modeling mainly focuses on scenarios where the signal propagation process is not affected by any obstacle and the radiation intensity (RI) of the light source is uniformly distributed. To eliminate these restrictions, we propose a single-collision model for the NLoS UV channel incorporating a cuboid-shaped obstacle, where the RI of the UV light source is modeled as the Lambertian distribution. For easy interpretation, we categorize the intersection circumstances between the receiver field-of-view and the obstacle into six cases and provide derivations of the weighting factor for each case. To investigate the accuracy of the proposed model, we compare it with the associated Monte Carlo photon tracing model via simulations and experiments. Results verify the correctness of the proposed model. This work reveals that obstacle avoidance is not always beneficial for NLoS UV communications and provides guidelines for relevant system design.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Integrated Passive Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the base station (BS) passively senses the channel parameters using the information carrying signals from a user. To simultaneously guarantee decoding and sensing performance, the user adopts sparse regression codes (SPARCs) with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to transmit its information bits. The BS generates an initial coarse channel estimation of the parameters after receiving the pilot signal. Then, a novel iterative decoding and parameter sensing algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords indicated by the CRC bits are utilized to improve the sensing and channel estimation performance at the BS. In turn, the improved estimate of the channel parameters lead to a better decoding performance. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed iterative decoding and sensing algorithm, where both the sensing and the communication performance are significantly improved with a few iterations. Extensive ablation studies concerning different channel estimation methods and number of CRC bits are carried out for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Inter-RIS Beam Focusing Codebook Design in Cooperative Distributed RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) by introducing a cooperative dimension that enhances adaptability and performance. It focuses on strategically deploying multiple RISs to improve Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity with the Base Station (BS) and among RISs, thereby aiding users in areas with weak BS coverage and enhancing spatial multiplexing gain. Each RIS can act as a main RIS (mRIS) to directly support users or as an intermediate RIS (iRIS) to reflect signals to another mRIS. This dual functionality allows for flexible responses to changing conditions. We implement an inter-RIS signal focusing design for phase shifts, creating a tailored codebook for precise control over signal direction. This design considers the interplay of incidence and reflection angles to maximize reflected signal power, based on the RIS response function and the physical properties of the RIS elements.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Structure of Two Graphs with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution to deal with unstructured data, outperforming traditional deep learning architectures. However, most of the current GNN models are designed to work with a single graph, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios where multiple graphs may be involved. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning architecture to handle tasks where two sets of signals exist, each defined on a different graph. First we consider the setting where the input is represented as a signal on top of one graph (input graph) and the output is a graph signal defined over a different graph (output graph). For this setup, we propose a three-block architecture where we first process the input data using a GNN that operates over the input graph, then apply a transformation function that operates in a latent space and maps the signals from the input to the output graph, and finally implement a second GNN that operates over the output graph. Our goal is not to propose a single specific definition for each of the three blocks, but rather to provide a flexible approach to solve tasks involving data defined on two graphs. The second part of the paper addresses a self-supervised setup, where the focus is not on the output space but on the underlying latent space and, inspired by Canonical Correlation Analysis, we seek informative representations of the data that can be leveraged to solve a downstream task. By leveraging information from multiple graphs, the proposed architecture can capture more intricate relationships between different entities in the data. We test this in several experimental setups using synthetic and real world datasets, and observe that the proposed architecture works better than traditional deep learning architectures, showcasing the importance of leveraging the information of the two graphs.</description>

      <title>Discern-XR: An Online Classifier for Metaverse Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design an exclusive Metaverse network traffic classifier, named Discern-XR, to help Internet service providers (ISP) and router manufacturers enhance the quality of Metaverse services. Leveraging segmented learning, the Frame Vector Representation (FVR) algorithm and Frame Identification Algorithm (FIA) are proposed to extract critical frame-related statistics from raw network data having only four application-level features. A novel Augmentation, Aggregation, and Retention Online Training (A2R-OT) algorithm is proposed to find an accurate classification model through online training methodology. In addition, we contribute to the real-world Metaverse dataset comprising virtual reality (VR) games, VR video, VR chat, augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) traffic, providing a comprehensive benchmark. Discern-XR outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers by 7% while improving training efficiency and reducing false-negative rates. Our work advances Metaverse network traffic classification by standing as the state-of-the-art solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design to Dual-Scale Channel Estimation for Sensing-Assisted Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication is critical to enhance the system efficiency in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, most existing literature focuses on large-scale channel sensing, without considering the impacts of small-scale channel aging. In this paper, we investigate a dual-scale channel estimation framework for sensing-assisted communication, where both large-scale channel sensing and small-scale channel aging are considered. By modeling the channel aging effect with block fading and incorporating CRB (Cram\'er-Rao bound)-based sensing errors, we optimize both the time duration of large-scale detection and the frequency of small-scale update within each subframe to maximize the achievable rate while satisfying sensing requirements. Since the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose a two-dimensional search-based optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed optimal design over three counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting active users in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network poses a significant challenge for 5G/6G applications. Traditional algorithms tackling this task, relying on classical processors, have to make a compromise between performance and complexity. However, a quantum computing based strategy called quantum annealing (QA) can mitigate this trade-off. In this paper, we first propose a mapping between the AUD searching problem and the identification of the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. Then, we compare the execution times of our QA approach for several code domain multiple access (CDMA) scenarios. We evaluate the impact of the cross-correlation properties of the chosen codes in a NOMA network for detecting the active user's set.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms for solving the MLE problem: an exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm and an inexact CD algorithm. The exact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem exactly using matrix eigenvalue decomposition and polynomial root-finding. By approximating the objective function appropriately, the inexact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem inexactly with lower complexity and more robust numerical performance. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Simulation results demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight QoS-Aware Resource Allocation Method for NR-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which includes Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) networks, is gaining significant attention due to the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles. V2X systems require diverse Quality of Service (QoS) provisions, with V2V communication demanding stricter latency and reliability compared to V2I. The 5G New Radio-V2X (NR-V2X) standard addresses these needs using multi-numerology Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which allows for flexible allocation of radio resources. However, V2I and V2V users sharing the same radio resources leads to interference, necessitating efficient power and resource allocation. In this work, we propose a novel resource allocation and sharing algorithm for 5G-based V2X systems. Our approach first groups Resource Blocks (RBs) into Resource Chunks (RCs) and allocates them to V2I users using the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. Power is then allocated to RCs to facilitate efficient resource sharing between V2I and V2V users through a bisection search method. Finally, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to pair V2I and V2V users, maintaining low computational complexity while ensuring high performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed Gale-Shapley Resource Allocation with Gale-Shapley Sharing (GSRAGS) achieves competitive performance with lower complexity compared to existing works while effectively meeting the QoS demands of V2X communication systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs)-aided multiuser multiple-input single output (MISO) antenna systems. The main objective is to minimize total transmitted power by the DMAs while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink beamforming. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMAs require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wavedomain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. The dynamic reconfigurability and holography-based beamforming of metasurface arrays make DMAs promising candidates for power-efficient networks by reducing the need for power-hungry RF chains. On the other hand, the physical constraints on DMA weights and wave-domain precoding of multiple DMA elements through reduced number of RF suppliers can limit the degrees of freedom (DoF) in beamforming optimizations compared to conventional fully digital (FD) architectures. This paper investigates the optimization of downlink beamforming in DMA-aided networks, focusing on power efficiency and addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>An ambient denoising method based on multi-channel non-negative matrix factorization for wheezing detection</title>

Abstract: In this paper, a parallel computing method is proposed to perform the background denoising and wheezing detection from a multi-channel recording captured during the auscultation process. The proposed system is based on a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach and a detection strategy. Moreover, the initialization of the proposed model is based on singular value decomposition to avoid dependence on the initial values of the NMF parameters. Additionally, novel update rules to simultaneously address the multichannel denoising while preserving an orthogonal constraint to maximize source separation have been designed. The proposed system has been evaluated for the task of wheezing detection showing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms when noisy sound sources are present. Moreover, parallel and high-performance techniques have been used to speedup the execution of the proposed system, showing that it is possible to achieve fast execution times, which enables its implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pan-Tompkins++: A Robust Approach to Detect R-peaks in ECG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R-peak detection is crucial in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing as it is the basis of heart rate variability analysis. The Pan-Tompkins algorithm is the most widely used QRS complex detector for the monitoring of many cardiac diseases including arrhythmia detection. However, the performance of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm in detecting the QRS complexes degrades in low-quality and noisy signals. This article introduces Pan-Tompkins++, an improved Pan-Tompkins algorithm. A bandpass filter with a passband of 5--18 Hz followed by an N-point moving average filter has been applied to remove the noise without discarding the significant signal components. Pan-Tompkins++ uses three thresholds to distinguish between R-peaks and noise peaks. Rather than using a generalized equation, different rules are applied to adjust the thresholds based on the pattern of the signal for the accurate detection of R-peaks under significant changes in signal pattern. The proposed algorithm reduces the False Positive and False Negative detections, and hence improves the robustness and performance of Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Pan-Tompkins++ has been tested on four open source datasets. The experimental results show noticeable improvement for both R-peak detection and execution time. We achieve 2.8% and 1.8% reduction in FP and FN, respectively, and 2.2% increase in F-score on average across four datasets, with 33% reduction in execution time. We show specific examples to demonstrate that in situations where the Pan-Tompkins algorithm fails to identify R-peaks, the proposed algorithm is found to be effective. The results have also been contrasted with other well-known R-peak detection algorithms. Code available at: https://github.com/Niaz-Imtiaz/Pan-Tompkins-Plus-Plus</description>

      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) schemes for image transmission over cooperative relay channels. The relay either amplifies-and-forwards its received signal, called DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features from its received signal, called DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). We consider both half- and full-duplex relays, and propose a novel transformer-based model at the relay. For a half-duplex relay, it is shown that the proposed scheme learns to generate correlated signals at the relay and source to obtain beamforming gains. In the full-duplex case, we introduce a novel block-based transmission strategy, in which the source transmits in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal. To enhance practicality, a single transformer-based model is used at the relay at each block, together with an adaptive transmission module, which allows the model to seamlessly adapt to different channel qualities and the transmission powers}. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepJSCC-PF compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, in both half- and full-duplex relay scenarios over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.</description>

      <title>Unmasking the Role of Remote Sensors in Comfort, Energy and Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single-zone multi-node systems (SZMRSs), temperature controls rely on a single probe near the thermostat, resulting in temperature discrepancies that cause thermal discomfort and energy waste. Augmenting smart thermostats (STs) with per-room sensors has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers. This paper leverages additional sensory information to empirically characterize the services provided by buildings, including thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and demand response (DR). Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMNSs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3{\deg}F to 2.5{\deg}F from the average. Moreover, in 95% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25%. This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMNSs.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Multi-Object Estimation via Labeled Random Finite Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the Labeled Random Finite Set (LRFS) framework for multi-object systems-systems in which the number of objects and their states are unknown and vary randomly with time. In particular, we focus on state and trajectory estimation via a multi-object State Space Model (SSM) that admits principled tractable multi-object tracking filters/smoothers. Unlike the single-object counterpart, a time sequence of states does not necessarily represent the trajectory of a multi-object system. The LRFS formulation enables a time sequence of multi-object states to represent the multi-object trajectory that accommodates trajectory crossings and fragmentations. We present the basics of LRFS, covering a suite of commonly used models and mathematical apparatus (including the latest results not published elsewhere). Building on this, we outline the fundamentals of multi-object state space modeling and estimation using LRFS, which formally address object identities/trajectories, ancestries for spawning objects, and characterization of the uncertainty on the ensemble of objects (and their trajectories). Numerical solutions to multi-object SSM problems are inherently far more challenging than those in standard SSM. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we discuss state-of-the-art implementations that address key computational bottlenecks in the number of objects, measurements, sensors, and scans.</description>

      <title>Upper Mid-Band Channel Measurements and Characterization at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 in an Indoor Factory Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor factory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth channel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes a representative small factory with diverse machinery and open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) path loss model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss exponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS PLE is similar to free-space propagation. The RMS delay spread (DS) decreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Similarly, RMS angular spread (AS) measurements show wider spreads in NLOS compared to LOS at both frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These observations in a dense-scatterer environment demonstrate frequency-dependent behavior that deviate from existing industry-standard models. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation mechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust industrial wireless networks at upper mid-band frequencies.</description>

      <title>Is K-fold cross validation the best model selection method for Machine Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a technique that can compactly represent complex patterns, machine learning has significant potential for predictive inference. K-fold cross-validation (CV) is the most common approach to ascertaining the likelihood that a machine learning outcome is generated by chance, and it frequently outperforms conventional hypothesis testing. This improvement uses measures directly obtained from machine learning classifications, such as accuracy, that do not have a parametric description. To approach a frequentist analysis within machine learning pipelines, a permutation test or simple statistics from data partitions (i.e., folds) can be added to estimate confidence intervals. Unfortunately, neither parametric nor non-parametric tests solve the inherent problems of partitioning small sample-size datasets and learning from heterogeneous data sources. The fact that machine learning strongly depends on the learning parameters and the distribution of data across folds recapitulates familiar difficulties around excess false positives and replication. A novel statistical test based on K-fold CV and the Upper Bound of the actual risk (K-fold CUBV) is proposed, where uncertain predictions of machine learning with CV are bounded by the worst case through the evaluation of concentration inequalities. Probably Approximately Correct-Bayesian upper bounds for linear classifiers in combination with K-fold CV are derived and used to estimate the actual risk. The performance with simulated and neuroimaging datasets suggests that K-fold CUBV is a robust criterion for detecting effects and validating accuracy values obtained from machine learning and classical CV schemes, while avoiding excess false positives.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>
