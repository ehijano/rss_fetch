      <title>Ab initio study of the neutron and Fermi polarons on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) many-body approach on the lattice to study the equation of state for a fermionic impurity interacting with a background sea of spin-polarized fermions. The impurity, or polaron, is an interesting system in both cold atomic and nuclear physics. Our approach is general, and we are able to straightforwardly study the polaron across these regimes. We first study the Fermi polaron at unitarity and for a wide range of scattering lengths, comparing against previous theoretical and experimental studies. We then explore the neutron polaron which has been shown to be an important constraint for nuclear physics. We have also employed the recently developed parametric matrix model to emulate AFQMC solutions to the two-body problem on the lattice, to accelerate the tuning of our lattice Hamiltonian parameters directly to two-body energies in a periodic box, following Lscher's formula. Our lattice Quantum Monte Carlo results for the polaron in both a cold atomic and nuclear physics context can serve as stringent benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental research.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Factorial cumulants of proton multiplicity near a critical point using maximum entropy freeze-out prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of the maximum-entropy freeze-out prescription to calculate factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities near the conjectured QCD critical point in thermal equilibrium. We map the Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model to a parameterized class of possible EoS near QCD critical point. This equilibrium baseline highlights how factorial cumulants isolate critical fluctuations by subtracting trivial self-correlations, setting the stage for future out-of-equilibrium analyses. We identify the key non-universal aspects of the mapping to the Ising model that strongly control the characteristic properties, such as magnitude and location of the peaks of the factorial cumulants along the freeze-out curve.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of nuclei synthesis in pycnonuclear reaction $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose To investigate synthesis of nuclei in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium of neutron stars on the basis of understanding, how the compound nucleus is formed during collision of two nuclei. To implement microscopic formulation of nuclear interactions and fusion in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium. Methods (1) Nuclei synthesis in pycnonuclear reaction in dense medium of neutron star is investigated in the folding approximation of the cluster model. (2) Formation of compound nucleus in dense medium is studied with the method of Multiple Internal Reflections. Results (1) Wave functions of resonance states of $^{24}$Mg are determined by interaction of two $^{12}$C nuclei. (2) Clear maxima of probability of formation of compound nucleus in dense stellar medium are established at first time. (3) Difference between quasibound energies for potential of Woods-Saxon type and folding potentials with the shell-model approximation for wave functions is essential. (4) Formation of the compound nucleus is much more probable in the quasibound states than in states of zero-point vibrations. (5) Only the first quasibound energies for $^{12}$C + $^{12}$Care smaller than the barrier maximums. At these energies compound nuclear system has barrier which prevents its decay going through tunneling phenomenon. This is the new excited nucleus $^{24}$Mg synthesised in the neutron star. \item[Conclusions] Cluster approach with folding potential provides significant modification of picture of formation of compound nucleus, previously obtained concerning the potential of Woods-Saxon type. The highest precision is provided by the folding potential, created by semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and shell-model description of the internal structure of interacting $p$-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation patterns of nuclear response: low-spin giant resonances and soft modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear resonances provide a rich and versatile testbed for exploring fundamental aspects of physics, particularly within the domain of strongly correlated many-body systems. The overarching goal of the theory is to develop a consistent and predictive framework that is (i) capable of a spectroscopically accurate description and (ii) sufficiently general to be applied across different energy scales and transferable to a wide range of complex systems. Thoroughly capturing emergent collective phenomena that arise in nuclear media is the central challenge for the theory, which is discussed in this contribution. It concentrates on the themes inspired and influenced by Angela Bracco's research, in particular, on the fragmentation patterns of the monopole and dipole responses of medium-heavy nuclei and associated open problems.</description>

      <title>Low lying isomers in the region of superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study we want to give an overview on low lying isomeric states in the heaviest nuclei. After a short report on the early history on the discovery of nuclear isomerism and attempts to understand their physical nature, decay probabilities and structure of all low lying isomeric states in heaviest nuclei with half-lives typically longer than one microsecond are presentet. Special emphasisis is laid on cases where the above mentioned properties are still unclear or under discussion. We do not claim to have solved the problems in that cases, we rather want to give som hints for further discussions.</description>

      <title>Kaon-meson coupling from SU(3) flavour symmetry and application to antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron stars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, creating a favourable environment for the appearance of exotic states, such as strange and non-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we investigate these interactions by, for the first time, employing SU(3) flavor symmetry to study antikaon condensation in dense matter. We determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A Universal Four-Fermion Formation Framework and Odd-Even Staggering in $\alpha$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering phenomena are common in many physical systems across multiple scales. The nuclear $\alpha$ decay is one of the earliest observed evidences of clustering in quantum systems, yet its formation process remains poorly understood even today. In this letter, we propose a novel global odd-even staggering (OES) feature in $\alpha$ decay, which emerges during the clustering process. To unveil its origin, we develop a Universal Four-Fermion Formation Framework (U4F), which describes the formation of any four-nucleon cluster, such as $\alpha$ particle, from a general microscopic wave function, without assuming the preexistence of clustering or pairing. By combining U4F with the large-scale configuration-interaction approach, we demonstrate that the OES effect in $\alpha$ decay arises from the suppression of clustering correlations due to unpaired nucleons. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cluster formation in nuclei and have important implications for the production of new elements and nuclear synthesis in the universe.</description>

      <title>Estimation of deuteron binding energy with renormalization group-based effective interactions using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have obtained the binding energy of the deuteron on a quantum simulator using the variational quantum eigensolver for renormalization group (RG)-based low-momentum effective interactions. The binding energy (BE) has been calculated in the truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, using the Qiskit-Aer simulator in both noise-free and noisy cases. The noise models have been taken from the actual IBM quantum hardware, and the results obtained have been extrapolated to the zero noise limit. The number of HO basis states (hence qubits) needed for computing the BE to within 1 percent of the experimental value in the quantum simulator, decreases with decreasing RG parameter $\lambda$. The $\lambda$-dependence of the extent of entanglement between the oscillator modes has been analysed.</description>

      <title>Electron Capture and Bound-State $\beta$ Decays in Ions and Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new theory describing the variation of electron capture and bound-state $\beta$-decays in atomic ions and (non) local thermodynamic equilibrium ((N)LTE) plasmas. We adopt the Takahashi-Yokoi nuclear model with added corrections to first calculate the decay rate for each atomic configuration of the isotope, and then evaluate the in-plasma decay rate by combining them with the charge state distribution (CSD) consistent with plasma density and temperature. Our approach expands the thermodynamic parameter space in which in-plasma $\beta$-decays can be studied, opening the possibility to validate the model in low-density laboratory magnetoplasmas before application to stellar nucleosynthesis. The model is explained using $^{7}$Be, and then applied to higher mass isotopes such as $^{140}$Pr$^{0+,57+,58+}$, $^{142}$Pm$^{0+,59+,60+}$ and $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$. Our model is therefore amenable to isotopes in a wide range of masses, in both single charge state or in a plasma-generated CSD.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and nuclear symmetry energy from neutron star observations: Constraints in light of PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition (FOPT) in neutron-star interiors remains an open question. Whether such a transition can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of $B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities ($&lt;1.1\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates positively with the radius difference between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$ stars.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Semi-Inclusive Electron-Positron Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>
