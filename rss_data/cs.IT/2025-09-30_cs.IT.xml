      <title>The Service Rate Region of Hamming Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of individual data objects. We establish upper bounds on the sum of service rates of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated generator matrix.</description>

      <title>Multihead Finite-State Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multihead finite-state dimension, a generalization of finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time, enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using betting strategies called gales, determines the multihead finite-state dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head finite-state gamblers. We prove that multihead finite-state dimension is stable under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number $h&gt;1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability property.</description>

      <title>Zigzag Codes Revisited: From Optimal Rebuilding to Small Skip Cost and Small Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit zigzag array codes, a family of MDS codes known for achieving optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio in single-node repair. In this work, we endow zigzag codes with two new properties: small field size and low skip cost. First, we prove that when the row-indexing group is $\mathcal{G} = \mathbb{Z}_2^m$ and the field has characteristic two, explicit coefficients over any field with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge N$ guarantee the MDS property, thereby decoupling the dependence among $p$, $k$, and $M$. Second, we introduce an ordering-and-subgroup framework that yields repair-by-transfer schemes with bounded skip cost and low repair-fragmentation ratio (RFR), while preserving optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio. Our explicit constructions include families with zero skip cost whose rates approach $2/3$, and families with bounded skip cost whose rates approach $3/4$ and $4/5$. These rates are comparable to those of MDS array codes widely deployed in practice. Together, these results demonstrate that zigzag codes can be made both more flexible in theory and more practical for modern distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>RIS- and Multi-Snapshot-Enabled SISO 3D Position and Velocity Estimation With Single Base Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS) anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this, we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements. Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to passive RIS.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted XL-MIMO for Near-Field and Far-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) downlink system, where an XL-MIMO array serves two groups of single-antennas users, namely near-field users (NFUEs) and far-field users (FFUEs). FFUEs are subject to blockage, and their communication is facilitated through the RIS. We consider three precoding schemes at the XL-MIMO array, namely central zero-forcing (CZF), local zero-forcing (LZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users are derived for MRT precoding, while statistical-form expressions are obtained for CZF and LZF processing. A heuristic visibility region (VR) selection algorithm is also introduced to help reduce the computational complexity of the precoding scheme. Furthermore, we devise a two-stage phase shifts design and power control algorithm to maximize the sum of weighted minimum SE of two groups of users with CZF, LZF and MRT precoding schemes. The simulation results indicate that, when equal priority is given to NFUEs and FFUEs, the proposed design improves the sum of the weighted minimum SE by 31.9\%, 37.8\%, and 119.2\% with CZF, LZF, and MRT, respectively, compared to the case with equal power allocation and random phase shifts design. CZF achieves the best performance, while LZF offers comparable results with lower complexity. When prioritizing NFUEs or FFUEs, LZF achieves strong performance for the prioritized group, whereas CZF ensures balanced performance between NFUEs and FFUEs.</description>

      <title>Absorbing Markov Chain-Based Analysis of Age of Information in Discrete-Time Dual-Queue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Status update systems require the timely collection of sensing information for which deploying multiple sensors/servers to obtain diversity gains is considered as a promising solution. In this work, we construct an absorbing Markov chain (AMC) to exactly model Age of Information (AoI) in a discretetime dual-queue (DTDQ) status update system with generate at will (GAW) status updates, discrete phase-type (DPH-type) distributed service times and transmission freezing. Specifically, transmission is frozen for a certain number of slots following the initiation of a transmission, after which one of the two servers is allowed to simultaneously sample the monitored physical process and transmit a status update packet, according to the availabilities and priorities of the two servers. Based on the discrete-time AMC, we provide the exact distributions of both AoI and peak AoI (PAoI), enabling the derivation of arbitrary order moments. In addition, we analytically study the role of freezing using several typical service time distributions, including geometric, uniform, and triangular distributions. The introduction of freezing for DTDQ systems is demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in reducing the mean AoI for various service time distributions. Additionally, we study the impact of the statistical parameters of the service times and heterogeneity between the two servers on the freezing gain, i.e., reduction in mean AoI attained with optimum freezing policies.</description>

      <title>Noise-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Three Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel three-user noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA) scheme by introducing the correlation as a new dimension besides mean and variance quantities used in two-user ND-NOMA. The new three-user ND-NOMA scheme includes both uplink and downlink scenarios, with detectors designed to decode the information embedded in mean, variance, and correlation. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results under Rician fading channels show that the proposed system is capable of achieving promising bit error rate (BER) performance while preserving the low power and low complexity advantages of ND-NOMA. This new ND-NOMA design enables simultaneous communication among three users using different dimensions, paving the way for scalable multi-user communication in noise-domain systems and in the Internet-of-things (IoT) environments.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Distributed Computing for Linearly Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of distributed computation of linearly separable functions, where a master node with access to $K$ datasets, employs $N$ servers to compute $L$ user-requested functions, each defined over the datasets. Servers are instructed to compute subfunctions of the datasets and must communicate computed outputs to the user, who reconstructs the requested outputs. The central challenge is to reduce the per-server computational load and the communication cost from servers to the user, while ensuring recovery for any possible set of $L$ demanded functions.
  We here establish the fundamental communication-computation tradeoffs for arbitrary $K$ and $L$, through novel task-assignment and communication strategies that, under the linear-encoding and no-subpacketization assumptions, are proven to be either exactly optimal or within a factor of three from the optimum. In contrast to prior approaches that relied on fixed assignments of tasks -- either disjoint or cyclic assignments -- our key innovation is a nullspace-based design that jointly governs task assignment and server transmissions, ensuring exact decodability for all demands, and attaining optimality over all assignment and delivery methods. To prove this optimality, we here uncover a duality between nullspaces and sparse matrix factorizations, enabling us to recast the distributed computing problem as an equivalent factorization task and derive a sharp information-theoretic converse bound. Building on this, we establish an additional converse that, for the first time, links the communication cost to the covering number from the theory of general covering designs.</description>

      <title>Post-disaster Max-Min Rate Optimization for Multi-UAV RSMA Network in Obstacle Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission scheme to maximize the minimum achievable rate among ground users for emergency communications in post-disaster scenarios with obstacles, with which the optimal positioning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled base stations can be achieved timely.To address the resulting non-convex and intractable optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization approach. Specifically, we relax obstacle-related constraints using penalty terms. In each iteration, block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) are applied alternately to obtain locally optimal solutions, and penalty multipliers are updated to ensure convergence of the relaxed problem to the original one. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the minimum achievable rate, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Achieving Codes for Noisy Insertion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding capacity.</description>

      <title>Finite-blocklength Fluid Antenna Systems With Spatial Block-Correlation Channel Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP). Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed antenna placement.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Communication with Distortion Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting, in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors, communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics, suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered compression methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Movable Antennas: Mechanical Power Modeling and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs' positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks</description>

      <title>Splitting Alternating Algorithms for Sparse Solutions of Linear Systems with Concatenated Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of splitting alternating algorithms is proposed for finding the sparse solution of linear systems with concatenated orthogonal matrices. Depending on the number of matrices concatenated, the proposed algorithms are classified into the two-block splitting alternating algorithm (TSAA) and the multi-block splitting alternating algorithm (MSAA). These algorithms aim to decompose a large-scale linear system into two or more coupled subsystems, each significantly smaller than the original system, and then combine the solutions of these subsystems to produce the sparse solution of the original system. The proposed algorithms only involve matrix-vector products and reduced orthogonal projections. It turns out that the proposed algorithms are globally convergent to the sparse solution of a linear system if the matrix (along with the sparsity level of the solution) satisfies a coherence-type condition. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are very promising and can quickly and accurately locate the sparse solution of a linear system with significantly fewer iterations than several mainstream iterative methods.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Amplitude-Based Models for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on low-rank phase retrieval, which aims to reconstruct a matrix $\mathbf{X}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ with ${\mathrm{ rank}}(\mathbf{X}_0)\le r$ from noise-corrupted amplitude measurements $\mathbf{y}=|\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X}_0)|+\boldsymbol{\eta}$, where $\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a linear map and $\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the noise vector. We first examine the rank-constrained nonlinear least-squares model $\hat{\mathbf{X}}\in \mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m},\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{X})\le r}}\||\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X})|-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$ to estimate $\mathbf{X}_0$, and demonstrate that the reconstruction error satisfies $\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F, \|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim \frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ with high probability, provided $\mathcal{A}$ is a Gaussian measurement ensemble and $p\gtrsim (m+n)r$. We also prove that the error bound $\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ is tight up to a constant. Furthermore, we relax the rank constraint to a nuclear-norm constraint. Hence, we propose the Lasso model for low-rank phase retrieval, i.e., the constrained nuclear-norm model and the unconstrained version. We also establish comparable theoretical guarantees for these models. To achieve this, we introduce a strong restricted isometry property (SRIP) for the linear map $\mathcal{A}$, analogous to the strong RIP in phase retrieval. This work provides a unified treatment that extends existing results in both phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery from rank-one measurements.</description>

      <title>On the Error Rate of Binary BCH Codes under Error-and-erasure Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the exact decoding error probability of linear block codes is an interesting problem. For binary BCH codes, McEliece derived methods to estimate the error probability of a simple bounded distance decoding (BDD) for BCH codes. However, BDD falls short in many applications. In this work, we consider error-and-erasure decoding and its variants that improve upon BDD. We derive closed-form expressions for their error probabilities and validate them through simulations. Then, we illustrate their use in assessing concatenated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security over Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-assisted Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the secrecy performance of wireless communication systems assisted by a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS). Unlike conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed geometries, FRISs dynamically select a subset of reflective elements based on real-time channel conditions, offering enhanced spatial diversity and adaptability. Using this foundation, we model a secure downlink scenario where a base station communicates with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the propagation is assisted by a FRIS with a limited number of elements set to the ON state. We analyze the system's secrecy performance under spatial correlation by deriving analytical lower and upper bounds for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), respectively. Our results demonstrate that FRIS effectively enables secure communication under spatial correlation. Even with partial activation, FRIS significantly outperforms conventional RISs in enhancing secrecy performance under varying deployment densities and element correlations.</description>

      <title>Capacity Achieving Design for Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wireless networks are designed to optimize spectral efficiency for human users, who typically require sustained connections for high-data-rate applications like file transfers and video streaming. However, these networks are increasingly inadequate for the emerging era of machine-type communications (MTC). With a vast number of devices exhibiting sporadic traffic patterns consisting of short packets, the grant-based multiple access procedures utilized by existing networks lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. To address this issue the unsourced random access (URA) paradigm has been proposed. This paradigm assumes the devices to share a common encoder thus simplifying the reception process by eliminating the identification procedure. The URA paradigm not only addresses the computational challenges but it also considers the random access (RA) as a coding problem, i.e., takes into account both medium access protocols and physical layer effects. In this monograph we provide a comprehensive overview of the URA problem in noisy channels, with the main task being to explain the major ideas rather than to list all existing solutions.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>On the hardness of approximating minimum distances of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing distances of error-correcting codes is fundamental in both the classical and quantum settings. While hardness for the classical version of these problems has been known for some time (in both the exact and approximate settings), it was only recently that Kapshikar and Kundu showed these problems are also hard in the quantum setting. As our first main result, we reprove this using arguably simpler arguments based on hypergraph product codes. In particular, we get a direct reduction to CSS codes, the most commonly used type of quantum code, from the minimum distance problem for classical linear codes.
  Our second set of results considers the distance of a graph state, which is a key parameter for quantum codes obtained via the codeword stabilized formalism. We show that it is NP-hard to compute/approximate the distance of a graph state when the adjacency matrix of the graph is the input. In fact, we show this is true even if we only consider X-type errors of a graph state. Our techniques moreover imply an interesting classical consequence: the hardness of computing or approximating the distance of classical codes with rate equal to 1/2.
  One of the main motivations of the present work is a question raised by Kapshikar and Kundu concerning the NP-hardness of approximation when there is an additive error proportional to a quantum code's length. We show that no such hardness can hold for hypergraph product codes. These observations suggest the possibility of a new kind of square root barrier.</description>

      <title>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</description>

      <title>Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay scheme.</description>

      <title>Calibration Meets Reality: Making Machine Learning Predictions Trustworthy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

      <title>Semantic Representation of Processes with Ontology Design Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation of workflows and processes is essential in materials science engineering, where experimental and computational reproducibility depend on structured and semantically coherent process models. Although numerous ontologies have been developed for process modeling, they are often complex and challenging to reuse. Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) offer modular and reusable modeling solutions to recurring problems; however, these patterns are frequently neither explicitly published nor documented in a manner accessible to domain experts. This study surveys ontologies relevant to scientific workflows and engineering process modeling and identifies implicit design patterns embedded within their structures. We evaluate the capacity of these ontologies to fulfill key requirements for process representation in materials science. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for the automatic extraction of design patterns from existing ontologies and assess the approach against curated ground truth patterns. All resources associated with this work, including the extracted patterns and the extraction workflow, are made openly available in a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the edge inducibility problem. This is a common refinement of both the well known Kruskal--Katona theorem and the inducibility question introduced by Pippenger and Golumbic.
  Our first result is a hardness result. It shows that for any graph $G$, there is a related graph $G'$ whose edge inducibility determines the vertex inducibility of $G$. Moreover, we determine the edge inducibility of every $G$ with at most $4$ vertices, and make some progress on the cases $G=C_5,P_6$. Lastly, we extend our hardness result to graphs with a perfect matching that is the unique fractional perfect matching. This is done by introducing locally directed graphs, which are natural generalizations of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limit of Discrete Distribution Estimation under Utility-Optimized Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of discrete distribution estimation under utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP), which enforces local differential privacy (LDP) on sensitive data while allowing more accurate inference on non-sensitive data. In this setting, we completely characterize the fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. The converse proof builds on several key ideas, including a generalized uniform asymptotic Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, a reduction showing that it suffices to consider a newly defined class of extremal ULDP mechanisms, and a novel distribution decomposition technique tailored to ULDP constraints. For the achievability, we propose a class of utility-optimized block design (uBD) schemes, obtained as nontrivial modifications of the block design mechanism known to be optimal under standard LDP constraints, while incorporating the distribution decomposition idea used in the converse proof and a score-based linear estimator. These results provide a tight characterization of the estimation accuracy achievable under ULDP and reveal new insights into the structure of optimal mechanisms for privacy-preserving statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Source-Channel Coding for Multi-User Semantic and Data Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-user semantic and data communication (MU-SemDaCom) system, where a base station (BS) simultaneously serves users with different semantic and data tasks through a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) channel. The coexistence of heterogeneous communication tasks, diverse channel conditions, and the requirements for digital compatibility poses significant challenges to the efficient design of MU-SemDaCom systems. To address these issues, we propose a multi-user adaptive source-channel coding (MU-ASCC) framework that adaptively optimizes deep neural network (DNN)-based source coding, digital channel coding, and superposition broadcasting. First, we employ a data-regression method to approximate the end-to-end (E2E) semantic and data distortions, for which no closed-form expressions exist. The obtained logistic formulas decompose the E2E distortion as the addition of the source and channel distortion terms, in which the logistic parameter variations are task-dependent and jointly determined by both the DNN and channel parameters. Then, based on the derived formulas, we formulate a weighted-sum E2E distortion minimization problem that jointly optimizes the source-channel coding rates, power allocation, and beamforming vectors for both the data and semantic users. Finally, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is developed, where the adaptive rate optimization is solved using the subgradient descent method, while the joint power and beamforming is addressed via the uplink-downlink duality (UDD) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) and deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) schemes that are designed for a single task, the proposed MU-ASCC scheme achieves simultaneous improvements in both the data recovery and semantic task performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rejection sampling is a popular method used to generate numbers that follow some given distribution. We study the use of this method to generate random numbers in the unit interval from increasing probability density functions. We focus on the problem of sampling from $n$ correlated random variables from a joint distribution whose marginal distributions are all increasing. We show that, in the worst case, the expected number of random bits required to accept or reject a sample grows at least linearly and at most quadratically with $n$.</description>

      <title>Parametrized complexity of relations between multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parametrized complexity of fundamental relations between multidimensional subshifts, such as equality, conjugacy, inclusion, and embedding, for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and effective subshifts. We build on previous work of E. Jeandel and P. Vanier on the complexity of these relations as two-input problems, by fixing one subshift as parameter and taking the other subshift as input. We study the impact of various dynamical properties related to periodicity, minimality, finite type, etc. on the computational properties of the parameter subshift, which reveals interesting differences and asymmetries.
  Among other notable results, we find choices of parameter that reach the maximum difficulty for each problem; we find nontrivial decidable problems for multidimensional SFT, where most properties are undecidable; and we find connections with recent work relating having computable language and being minimal for some property, showing in particular that this property may not always be chosen conjugacy-invariant.</description>

      <title>Delsarte duality on subspaces and applications to rank-metric codes and q-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the lattice of F_{q^m}-subspaces and the lattice of F_{q^m}-subspaces of an F_{q^m}-vector space. Introducing notions of weight and defect relative to an F_q-subspace, we analyze the sequence of maximum non-zero defects. We establish a correspondence between subspaces of positive defect and their Delsarte duals, enabling explicit characterizations of the associated sequences of maximum non-zero defects. Our framework unifies several classes of subspaces studied in finite geometry and connects them to linear rank-metric codes by providing a new geometric interpretation of code duality. Building on these results, we characterize classes of rank-metric codes closed under duality, including MRD, near MRD, quasi-MRD, and a new family of (n, k)-MRD codes. Finally, we explore applications to q-matroids, by studying the problem of F_{q^m}-representability for direct sums of uniform q-matroids and describing their rank generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies several research directions concerning the Shannon capacity of graphs. Building on Schrijver's recent framework, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Shannon capacity of a polynomial in graphs equals the corresponding polynomial of the individual capacities, thereby simplifying their evaluation. We derive exact values and new bounds for the Shannon capacity of two families of graphs: the q-Kneser graphs and the Tadpole graphs. Furthermore, we construct graphs whose Shannon capacity is never attained by the independence number of any finite power of these graphs, including a countably infinite family of connected graphs with this property. We further prove an inequality relating the Shannon capacities of the strong product of graphs and their disjoint union, leading to streamlined proofs of known bounds.</description>

      <title>RDD: Pareto Analysis of the Rate-Distortion-Distinguishability Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.</description>

      <title>Inductive Bias and Spectral Properties of Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Performance Limit for Radar Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.04986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the thoughts and methodologies of Shannon's information theory to solve the problem of the optimal radar parameter estimation. Based on a general radar system model, the \textit{a posteriori} probability density function of targets' parameters is derived. Range information (RI) and entropy error (EE) are defined to evaluate the performance. It is proved that acquiring 1 bit of the range information is equivalent to reducing estimation deviation by half. The closed-form approximation for the EE is deduced in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, which demonstrates that the EE degenerates to the mean square error (MSE) when the SNR is tending to infinity. Parameter estimation theorem is then proved, which claims that the theoretical RI is achievable.
  The converse claims that there exists no unbiased estimator whose empirical RI is larger than the theoretical RI. Simulation result demonstrates that the theoretical EE is tighter than the commonly used Cram\'er-Rao bound and the ZivZakai bound.</description>

      <title>Pattern Division Random Access (PDRA) for M2M Communications with Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the pattern-domain pilot design paradigm based on a "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" with significantly larger contention space to enhance the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) random access (RA) performance in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.Specifically, the pattern-domain pilot is constructed based on the superposition of $L$ cyclically-shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The pattern-domain pilots exhibit zero correlation values between non-colliding patterns from the same root and low correlation values between patterns from different roots. The increased contention space, i.e., from N to $\binom{N}{L}$, where $\binom{N}{L}$ denotes the number of all L-combinations of a set N, and low correlation valueslead to a significantly lower pilot collision probability without compromising excessively on channel estimation performance for mMTC RA in massive MIMO systems.We present the framework and analysis of the RA success probability of the pattern-domain based scheme with massive MIMO systems.Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pattern division random access (PDRA) scheme achieves an appreciable performance gain over the conventional one,while preserving the existing physical layer virtually unchanged. The extension of the "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" scheme to "superposition of quasi-orthogonal-building-blocks" is straightforward.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the sum-rank metric analogue of Reed--Muller codes, which we called linearized Reed--Muller codes, using multivariate Ore polynomials. We study the parameters of these codes, compute their dimension and give a lower bound for their minimum distance. Our codes exhibit quite good parameters, respecting a similar bound to Reed--Muller codes in the Hamming metric. Finally, we also show that many of the newly introduced linearized Reed--Muller codes can be embedded in some linearized Algebraic Geometry codes, recently defined in arXiv:2303.08903, a property which could turn out to be useful in light of decoding.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Explicit Constructions for Rack-Aware Minimum Storage Partially Cooperative Regenerating Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rack-aware storage model improves repair efficiency by exploiting locality within racks to minimize cross-rack traffic in a distributed storage system. While the partially cooperative repair model presents a solution for multiple node failures that reduces the need to exchange data with all other host racks (defined as racks containing failed nodes), thus enhancing system flexibility. In this paper, we focus on rack-aware minimum storage partially cooperative regenerating (MSPCR) codes for repairing multiple node failures. We first derive the lower bound on the repair bandwidth for rack-aware MSPCR codes using extremal combinatorics, and then explicitly construct the first class of (asymptotically) optimal repair schemes for rack-aware MSPCR codes with a sub-packetization level of $(\bar{s}+\bar{h}-\delta)\bar{s}^{\bar{n}}$, which is smaller than that of the known rack-aware minimum-storage cooperative regenerating (MSCR) codes when $\delta \geq 2$. By utilizing the grouping technique, we explicitly construct the second class of (asymptotically) optimal repair schemes for rack-aware MSPCR codes with a sub-packetization level of $2^{\bar{n}}$. In particular, when $\delta=1$, our second codes reduce to rack-aware MSCR codes, while achieving an $(\bar{h}+1)$-fold reduction in sub-packetization level compared to the known rack-aware MSCR codes.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting $b$-symbol Codes for Locally $(\lambda, \rho,b)$-Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of functions plays a central role in the design and effectiveness of function-correcting codes. By focusing on a well-defined family of functions, function-correcting codes can be constructed with minimal length while still ensuring full error detection and correction within that family. In this work, we explore the concept of locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-functions for $b$-symbol read channels and investigate the optimal redundancy of the corresponding function-correcting $b$-symbol codes (FCBSC) by introducing the notions of locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. First, we discuss the values of $\lambda$ and $\rho$ for which a function can be considered as a locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-function in $b$-symbol metric. The findings improve some known results in the Hamming metric and present several new results in the $b$-symbol metric. Then we investigate the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-FCBSCs for locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. We establish a recurrence relation between the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting codes for the $(b+1)$-symbol read and $b$-symbol read channels. We present an upper bound on the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for general locally ($\lambda,\rho$, $b$)-functions by associating it to the minimum achievable length of $b$-symbol error-correcting codes and traditional Hamming-metric codes, given a fixed number of codewords and a specified minimum distance. We derive some explicit upper bounds on the redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for locally $(\lambda,2t,b)$-functions. Moreover, for the case where $b=1$, we show that a locally ($3,2t,1$)-function achieves the optimal redundancy of $3t$. Additionally, we explicitly investigate the locality and optimal redundancy of FCBSCs for the
  $b$-symbol weight function and weight distribution function for $b\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

Abstract: The paper explores three known methods, their variants and limitations, that can be used to obtain new entropy inequalities. The Copy Lemma was distilled from the original Zhang-Yeung construction which produced the first non-Shannon inequality. Its iterated version, effects of symmetrizations, and connections with polyhedral vertex enumeration are discussed. Another method, derived from the principle of maximum entropy, has the Copy Lemma as a special case. Nevertheless, none of the two presented variants is known to generate more inequalities than the iterated Copy Lemma. Finally, the Ahlswede-K\"orner method is shown to employ a hidden application of the Copy Lemma - the underlying lemma alone cannot generate new inequalities -, which makes this method strictly weaker than the Copy Lemma. The paper is written in a tutorial style and concludes with a list of open questions and research problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient $\varepsilon$-approximate minimum-entropy couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $m \ge 2$ discrete probability distributions over $n$ states each, the minimum-entropy coupling is the minimum-entropy joint distribution whose marginals are the same as the input distributions. Computing the minimum-entropy coupling is NP-hard, but there has been significant progress in designing approximation algorithms; prior to this work, the best known polynomial-time algorithms attain guarantees of the form $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + c$, where $c \approx 0.53$ for $m=2$, and $c \approx 1.22$ for general $m$ [CKQGK '23].
  A main open question is whether this task is APX-hard, or whether there exists a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). In this work, we design an algorithm that produces a coupling with entropy $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in running time $n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \operatorname{exp}(m) )}$: showing a PTAS exists for constant $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Understanding Transformer Architecture through Continuous Dynamics: A Partial Differential Equation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks through the lens of continuous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR &gt; 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Value Estimation and Bidding in Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.</description>

      <title>A Unified MDL-based Binning and Tensor Factorization Framework for PDF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

      <title>Curse of Slicing: Why Sliced Mutual Information is a Deceptive Measure of Statistical Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior. Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence (even under linear transformations designed to enhance the extraction of information), prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some cases, performs worse than simpler dependence measures like the correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</description>

      <title>Conditions for equality and stability in Shannon's and Tao's entropy power inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is equality in Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) if and only if the random variables involved are Gaussian, assuming nothing beyond the existence of differential entropies. This is done by justifying de Bruijn's identity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a re-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that there exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$ such that $h(X+Y) = \infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite entropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for any independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the continuity of $t \mapsto h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then establish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's EPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a quantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under log-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a compactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality and leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</description>
