      <title>Testing Shape Restrictions with Continuous Treatment: A Transformation Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose tests for the convexity/linearity/concavity of a transformation of the dependent variable in a semiparametric transformation model. These tests can be used to verify monotonicity of the treatment effect, or, equivalently, concavity/convexity of the outcome with respect to the treatment, in (quasi-)experimental settings. Our procedure does not require estimation of the transformation or the distribution of the error terms, thus it is easy to implement. The statistic takes the form of a U statistic or a localised U statistic, and we show that critical values can be obtained by bootstrapping. In our application we test the convexity of loan demand with respect to the interest rate using experimental data from South Africa.</description>

      <title>Fragility in Average Treatment Effect on the Treated under Limited Covariate Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under unconfoundedness when covariate overlap is partial. A formal diagnostic is proposed to characterize empirical support -- the subset of the covariate space where ATT is point-identified due to the presence of comparable untreated units. Where support is absent, standard estimators remain computable but cease to identify meaningful causal parameters. A general sensitivity framework is developed, indexing identified sets by curvature constraints on the selection mechanism. This yields a structural selection frontier tracing the trade-off between assumption strength and inferential precision. Two diagnostic statistics are introduced: the minimum assumption strength for sign identification (MAS-SI), and a fragility index that quantifies the minimal deviation from ignorability required to overturn qualitative conclusions. Applied to the LaLonde (1986) dataset, the framework reveals that nearly half the treated strata lack empirical support, rendering the ATT undefined in those regions. Simulations confirm that ATT estimates may be stable in magnitude yet fragile in epistemic content. These findings reframe overlap not as a regularity condition but as a prerequisite for identification, and recast sensitivity analysis as integral to empirical credibility rather than auxiliary robustness.</description>

      <title>A Distance Covariance-based Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an estimator that significantly weakens the relevance condition of conventional instrumental variable (IV) methods, allowing endogenous covariates to be weakly correlated, uncorrelated, or even mean-independent, though not independent of instruments. As a result, the estimator can exploit the maximum number of relevant instruments in any given empirical setting. Identification is feasible without excludability, and the disturbance term does not need to possess finite moments. Identification is achieved under a weak conditional median independence condition on pairwise differences in disturbances, along with mild regularity conditions. Furthermore, the estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The relevance condition required for identification is shown to be testable.</description>

      <title>Inference on the value of a linear program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies inference on the value of a linear program (LP) when both the objective function and constraints are possibly unknown and must be estimated from data. We show that many inference problems in partially identified models can be reformulated in this way. Building on Shapiro (1991) and Fang and Santos (2019), we develop a pointwise valid inference procedure for the value of an LP. We modify this pointwise inference procedure to construct one-sided inference procedures that are uniformly valid over large classes of data-generating processes. Our results provide alternative testing procedures for problems considered in Andrews et al. (2023), Cox and Shi (2023), and Fang et al. (2023) (in the low-dimensional case), and remain valid when key components--such as the coefficient matrix--are unknown and must be estimated. Moreover, our framework also accommodates inference on the identified set of a subvector, in models defined by linear moment inequalities, and does so under weaker constraint qualifications than those in Gafarov (2025).</description>

      <title>rd2d: Causal Inference in Boundary Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary discontinuity designs -- also known as Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs, with Geographic RD designs as a prominent example -- are often used in empirical research to learn about causal treatment effects along a continuous assignment boundary defined by a bivariate score. This article introduces the R package rd2d, which implements and extends the methodological results developed in Cattaneo, Titiunik and Yu (2025) for boundary discontinuity designs. The package employs local polynomial estimation and inference using either the bivariate score or a univariate distance-to-boundary metric. It features novel data-driven bandwidth selection procedures, and offers both pointwise and uniform estimation and inference along the assignment boundary. The numerical performance of the package is demonstrated through a simulation study.</description>
