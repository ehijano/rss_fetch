      <title>Unmasking Correlations in Nuclear Cross Sections with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to learn the relationships between nuclear cross-sections across the chart of isotopes. As a proof of principle, we focus on the neutron-induced reactions in the fast energy regime that are the most important in nuclear science and engineering. We use variational autoencoders (VAEs) and implicit neural representations (INRs) to build a learned feature representation space of nuclear cross sections and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We then train graph neural networks (GNNs) on the resulting latent space to leverage the topological information encoded in the chart of isotopes and to capture the relationships between cross sections in different nuclei. We find that hypernetworks based on INRs significantly outperforms VAEs in encoding nuclear cross-sections. This superiority is attributed to INR's ability to model complex, varying frequency details, which enables lower prediction errors when combined with GNNs. We also observe that GNN optimization is much more successful when performed in the latent space, whether using INRs or VAEs. However VAEs' continuous representation also allows for direct GNN training in the original input space. We leverage these representational learning techniques and successfully predict cross sections for a 17x17 block of nuclei with high accuracy and precision. These findings suggest that both representation encoding of cross-sections and the prediction task hold significant potential in augmenting nuclear theory models, e.g., providing reliable estimates of covariances of cross sections, including cross-material covariances.</description>

      <title>An implementation of nuclear many-body wave functions by the superposition of localized Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for the low-energy nuclear structure calculations, which describes the single-particle wave function as a superposition of localized Gaussians. It is a hybrid of the Hartree-Fock and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics models. In the numerical calculations of oxygen, calcium isotopes and 100Sn, the framework shows its potential by significantly improving upon AMD and yielding the results consistent with or even better than Hartree-Fock(-Bogoliubov) calculations based on harmonic oscillator expansions. In addition to the basic equations, general form of the matrix elements is also given.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for \hyt ~than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights to the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of $K^\ast$ induced by strange-baryon density inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference between the spin alignments of $K^\ast$ and those of $\phi$ at the low collision energies is a puzzle raised by the recent experiments. Unlike $\phi$ meson, $K^\ast$, carrying a unit strange charge, should react to strange chemical potential $\mu_S$. In this paper, we shall first convince you that $\mu_S$ is not small in a brayon-rich medium for keeping strange neutrality, and then derive the spin alignment induced by the gradient of $\mu_S$, and hence of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, using linear response theory, with the transport coefficients expressed, without any approximation, in terms of the $K^\ast$'s in-medium spectral properties by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. It turns out that such an effect applies mainly to the particles whose longitudinal and transverse modes diverge, and induces only the local spin alignment in a static medium. The magnitudes of these coefficients will be further estimated under the quasi-particle approximation.</description>

      <title>Avenues for a number density interpretation of dihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we reassess the underlying physics of the number sum rule for dihadron fragmentation functions. We will argue that, currently, there are no settled constraints on what constitutes a valid number density interpretation for multihadron fragmentation functions. Imposing overly restrictive criteria might lead to misinterpretating the data. Most importantly, and on the basis of phenomenological analyses, the slightly varying definitions used in previous work are not excluded from possessing legitimate number density interpretations (up to the usual issues with ultraviolet divergences and renormalization), so long as they are paired with appropriate factorization theorems. We advocate for further theoretical analyses to be challenged with experimental data, available at JLab or at the future EIC.</description>

      <title>Net proton number cumulants from viscous hydro with equation of state including a critical end point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the SMASH-CLVisc-hybrid framework, including SMASH for the initial conditions and the hadronic rescattering stage, and CLVisc for the quark gluon plasma (QGP) evolution, we investigate net baryon number fluctuations via considering the equation of state (EoS) with and without a critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase transition. Specifically, two distinct QCD EoS are utilized: one with smooth crossover derived from NEOS and another with a critical end point sourced from the rPNJL model. Our results show that non-monotonic behavior of $\kappa\sigma^2$ is not observed above the collision energy $7.7 {\rm GeV}$, nor are there explicit differences between the EoS characterized by crossover and that by CEP. This could be attributed to the significant deviation of the freeze-out line from the location of CEP. It is also found that the pure SMASH result of $\kappa \sigma^2$ is positive and close to zero at 3 GeV, which is different from the negative value observed from STAR.</description>

      <title>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom mixture, and investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom mixtures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how deep convolutional neural networks can be trained to predict 2+1 D hydrodynamic simulation results for flow coefficients, mean-transverse-momentum and charged particle multiplicity from the initial energy density profile. We show that this method provides results that are accurate enough, so that one can use neural networks to reliably estimate multi-particle flow correlators. Additionally, we train networks that can take any model parameter as an additional input and demonstrate with a few examples that the accuracy remains good. The usage of neural networks can reduce the computation time needed in performing Bayesian analyses with multi-particle flow correlators by many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance at leading order in a renormalizable framework of covariant chiral effective field theory. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes, which are obtained by solving the scattering equation within time-ordered perturbation theory, follow the quark mass trajectory of the Coordinated Lattice Simulations consortium. At $M_\pi\approx 200$ MeV and $M_K\approx 487$ MeV, our parameter-free prediction of $\Lambda(1405)$ poles is consistent with the recent lattice results of BaSc Collaboration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 051901 (2024)]. Varying the pion mass from $135$ MeV to $400$ MeV, we present the evolution of double-pole positions of $\Lambda(1405)$: the higher pole remains a resonance around the $\bar{K}N$ threshold; whereas the lower pole undergoes a transition from resonance to a virtual state, and ultimately to a bound state of the $\pi\Sigma$ system, which could serve as a prediction of the forthcoming lattice QCD simulations.</description>

Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute photon and dilepton production in the chemically equilibrating out-of-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma created in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We derive universal scaling functions for the pre-equilibrium spectra of photons and dileptons. These scaling functions can be used to make realistic predictions for the pre-equilibrium emission and consequently establish the significance of the pre-equilibrium phase for the production of electromagnetic probes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Addressing energy density functionals in the language of path-integrals I: Comparative study of diagrammatic techniques applied to the (0+0)-D $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^{4}$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy density functional (EDF) method is currently the only microscopic theoretical approach able to tackle the entire nuclear chart. Nevertheless, it suffers from limitations resulting from its empirical character and deteriorating its reliability. This paper is part of a larger program that aims at formulating the EDF approach as an effective field theory (EFT) in order to overcome these limitations. A relevant framework to achieve this is the path-integral (PI) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT). The latter indeed provides a wide variety of treatments of the many-body problem well suited to deal with non-perturbative interactions and to exploit a Lagrangian resulting from an EFT as a starting point. While developing the formalism in a general setting, we present a comparative study of such techniques applied to a toy model, i.e. the (0+0)-D $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^{4}$-theory. More specifically, our focus will be on the following diagrammatic techniques: loop expansion (LE), optimized perturbation theory (OPT) and self-consistent perturbation theory (SCPT). With these methods, we notably address the spontaneous breakdown of the $O(N)$ symmetry with care especially since spontaneous symmetry breakings (SSBs) play a paramount role in current implementations of the EDF approach.</description>

Abstract: An analysis of the slab phase as it is expected in the innermost layer of neutron-star crusts is performed within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework. We take the periodicity of the slabs into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to well describe the interplay between the band structure and superfluidity. We introduce a relative flow between the slabs and the surrounding neutron gas in a time-independent way. This induces a non-trivial phase of the complex order parameter, leading to a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the slabs. With the resulting current, we compute the actual neutron superfluid fraction. For the latter our results are slightly larger than previous ones obtained in normal band theory, suggesting that normal band theory overestimates the entrainment effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute photon production in the chemically equilibrating Quark-Gluon Plasma created in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We do a detailed comparison of pre-equilibrium photon rates to the thermal photon production. We show that the photon spectrum radiated from a hydrodynamic attractor evolution satisfies a simple scaling form in terms of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ and entropy density $dS/d\zeta \sim {\scriptstyle \left(T\tau^{1/3}\right)^{3/2}}_\infty$. We confirm the analytical predictions with numerical kinetic theory simulations. We use the extracted scaling function to compute the pre-equilibrium photon contribution in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\,\text{TeV}$ 0-20\% PbPb collisions. We demonstrate that our matching procedure allows for a smooth switching from pre-equilibrium kinetic to thermal hydrodynamic photon production. Finally, our publicly available implementation can be straightforwardly added to existing heavy ion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mass spectrum of the molecular pentaquarks composed of a baryon and a meson. We establish the underlying relations among the near-threshold interactions of the molecular tetraquark and pentaquark systems. We find the existence of the molecule candidates in the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $DD^\ast$, and $D\bar{D}^\ast$ systems indicates a substantial presence of the hadronic molecules in the {\it heavy} baryon plus {\it heavy} meson systems ({\it heavy} refers to the hadrons with the $c$ and/or $s$ quarks). We make an exhaustive prediction of the possible bound/virtual molecular states in the systems: $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)} K^\ast$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)} \bar{K}^\ast$, $\Xi^{(\ast)} K^\ast$, $\Xi^{(\ast)} \bar{K}^\ast$. Hunting for the predicted states in experiments will significantly deepen our understanding of the formation mechanism of the hadronic molecules, and shed light on the manifestation of flavor symmetry in the low-energy residual strong interactions.</description>
