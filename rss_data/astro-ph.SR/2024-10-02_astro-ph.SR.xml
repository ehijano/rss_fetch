      <title>APOKASC-3: The Third Joint Spectroscopic and Asteroseismic catalog for Evolved Stars in the Kepler Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the third APOKASC catalog, we present data for the complete sample of 15,808 evolved stars with APOGEE spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismology. We used ten independent asteroseismic analysis techniques and anchor our system on fundamental radii derived from Gaia $L$ and spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$. We provide evolutionary state, asteroseismic surface gravity, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them for 12,418 stars. This includes 10,036 exceptionally precise measurements, with median fractional uncertainties in \nmax, \dnu, mass, radius and age of 0.6\%, 0.6\%, 3.8\%, 1.8\%, and 11.1\% respectively. We provide more limited data for 1,624 additional stars which either have lower quality data or are outside of our primary calibration domain. Using lower red giant branch (RGB) stars, we find a median age for the chemical thick disk of $9.14 \pm 0.05 ({\rm ran}) \pm 0.9 ({\rm sys})$ Gyr with an age dispersion of 1.1 Gyr, consistent with our error model. We calibrate our red clump (RC) mass loss to derive an age consistent with the lower RGB and provide asymptotic GB and RGB ages for luminous stars. We also find a sharp upper age boundary in the chemical thin disk. We find that scaling relations are precise and accurate on the lower RGB and RC, but they become more model dependent for more luminous giants and break down at the tip of the RGB. We recommend the usage of multiple methods, calibration to a fundamental scale, and the usage of stellar models to interpret frequency spacings.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Blue large-amplitude pulsators formed from the merger of low-mass white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot stars pulsating in radial modes. Their origin needs to be explained, and several scenarios for their formation have already been proposed. We investigate whether BLAPs can originate as the product of a merger of two low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) and estimate how many BLAPs can be formed in this evolutionary channel. We used the MESA code to model the merger of three different double extremely low-mass (DELM) WDs and the subsequent evolution of the merger product. We also performed a population synthesis of Galactic DELM WDs using the COSMIC code. We find that BLAPs can be formed from DELM WDs provided that the total mass of the system ranges between 0.32 and 0.7 M$_\odot$. BLAPs born in this scenario either do not have any thermonuclear fusion at all or show off-centre He burning. The final product evolves to hot subdwarfs and eventually finishes its evolution either as a cooling He WD or a hybrid He/CO WD. The merger products become BLAPs only a few thousand years after coalescence, and it takes them 20 to 70 thousand years to pass the BLAP region. We found the instability of the fundamental radial mode to be in fair agreement with observations, but we also observed instability of the radial first overtone. From the population synthesis, we found that up to a few hundred BLAPs born in this scenario can exist at present in the Galaxy. Given the estimated number of BLAPs formed in the studied DELM WD merger scenario, there is a good chance to observe BLAPs that originated through this scenario. Since strong magnetic fields can be generated during mergers, this scenario could lead to the formation of magnetic BLAPs. This fits well with the discovery of two likely magnetic BLAPs whose pulsations can be explained in terms of the oblique rotator model.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks. III. Drastic morphological transformation across the mid-infrared in Oph163131</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST broadband images of the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTc2d J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131) from 2.0 to 21$\mu$m. The images show a remarkable evolution in disk structure with wavelength, quite different from previous JWST observations of other edge-on disks. At 2.0 and 4.4$\mu$m, Oph163131 shows two scattering surfaces separated by a dark lane, typical of highly inclined disks. Starting at 7.7$\mu$m however, 1) the two linear nebulosities flanking the dark lane disappear; 2) the brighter nebula tracing the disk upper surface transitions into a compact central source distinctly larger than the JWST PSF and whose intrinsic size increases with wavelength; and 3) patches of extended emission appear at low latitudes, and at surprisingly large radii nearly twice that of the scattered light seen with $HST$ and NIRCam, and of the gas. We interpret the compact central source as thermal emission from the star and the inner disk that is not seen directly, but which instead is able to progressively propagate to greater distances at longer wavelengths. The lack of sharp-edged structures in the extended patchy emission argues against the presence of shocks and suggests photoexcitation or stochastic heating of material smoothly flowing away from the star along the disk surface. Finally, the dark lane thickness decreases significantly between 0.6$\mu$m and 4.4$\mu$m which indicates that the surface layers of Oph163131 lack grains larger than 1$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation Learning for Predicting Solar Flares from Extremely Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major solar flares are abrupt surges in the Sun's magnetic flux, presenting significant risks to technological infrastructure. In view of this, effectively predicting major flares from solar active region magnetic field data through machine learning methods becomes highly important in space weather research. Magnetic field data can be represented in multivariate time series modality where the data displays an extreme class imbalance due to the rarity of major flare events. In time series classification-based flare prediction, the use of contrastive representation learning methods has been relatively limited. In this paper, we introduce CONTREX, a novel contrastive representation learning approach for multivariate time series data, addressing challenges of temporal dependencies and extreme class imbalance. Our method involves extracting dynamic features from the multivariate time series instances, deriving two extremes from positive and negative class feature vectors that provide maximum separation capability, and training a sequence representation embedding module with the original multivariate time series data guided by our novel contrastive reconstruction loss to generate embeddings aligned with the extreme points. These embeddings capture essential time series characteristics and enhance discriminative power. Our approach shows promising solar flare prediction results on the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) multivariate time series benchmark dataset against baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of five candidate delta Scuti-type pulsators in detached eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries (EBs) provide an excellent opportunity to obtain precise, model-independent stellar parameters for studying oscillations in detail. One common class of pulsators in these EBs exhibits delta Scuti-type oscillations. Characterising these pulsators using the precise parameters obtained from EB modelling enhances our understanding of such stars and strengthens asteroseismic studies.
  We conducted a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of candidate pulsators in detached EBs to expand the sample of systems with accurately determined absolute parameters. We performed radial velocity and light curve modelling to estimate the absolute stellar parameters, along with detailed spectroscopic modelling to obtain global metallicity and temperatures. Frequency power spectra were derived from the residuals of binary modelling. Isochrones were used to determine the stars' ages, which were then compared to theoretically obtained values.
  We present a detailed analysis of four candidate delta Scuti-type pulsators in EBs and update the light curve analysis of the previously studied system TIC 308953703. The masses and radii of the components are constrained with high accuracy, aiding in age estimation. We perform a Fourier analysis of the observed oscillations and explore their origin. For TIC 81702112, we report tidal effects causing amplitude variation in the oscillation frequencies over the orbital phase.</description>

      <title>Deriving the interaction point between a Coronal Mass Ejection and High Speed Stream: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing High-Speed Stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use Minimum Variance Analysis and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a Graduated Cylindrical Shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step Drag Based Model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle (MO) observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km/s and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km/s . We find that the HSS interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (approx 0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.</description>

      <title>The catalogue of $\delta$ Sct pulsators in binary systems in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The updated catalogue of $\delta$ Sct stars in binary systems as well as their statistical properties are presented. Thanks to the Kepler, K2 and TESS space missions, this version of the catalogue contains more than 1000 $\delta$ Sct pulsators in binaries. The sample is divided according to the Roche Geometry of the binary systems in order to check for any systematic differences in the pulsators' evolution due to the proximity of the companion star. Statistics, demographics, and distributions of these pulsating stars within the H-R and mass-radius diagrams are provided. We notice that the absolute parameters have been accurately determined for only approximately 10% of the whole sample. Additionally, updated correlations between pulsation and orbital periods and evolutionary status are presented. This work aims to motivate the researchers for systematic analyses of such objects in order to increase the sample of systems with well known physical properties.</description>

      <title>CME-associated type-IV radio bursts: The solar paradigm and the unique case of AD Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type-IV bursts, associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occasionally extend to the decameter-hectrometric (DH) range. We present a comprehensive catalog of simultaneous multi-vantage point observations of DH type-IV bursts by Wind and STEREO spacecraft since 2006. 73% of the bursts are associated with fast ($&gt; 900\,km\,s^{-1}$) and wide ($&gt;60^0$) CMEs, which are mostly geoeffective halo CMEs. Also, we find that the bursts are best observed by the spacecraft located within $|60^0|$ line of sight (LOS), highlighting the importance of LOS towards active latitudes while choosing target stars for a type-IV search campaign. In young active M dwarfs, CME-associated bursts have remained elusive despite many monitoring campaigns. We present the first detection of long-duration type-III, type-IV, and type-V bursts during an active event in AD Leo (M3.5V; $0.4M_\odot$). The observed burst characteristics support a multipole model over a solar-like active region magnetic field profile on the star.</description>

      <title>A catalog of multi-vantage point observations of type-II bursts: Statistics and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejection (CME) often produces a soft X-ray (SXR) flare associated with the low-coronal reconnection and a type-II radio burst associated with an interplanetary (IP) CME-shock. SXR flares and type-II bursts outshine the background emission, making them sun-as-a-star observables. Though there exist SXR flare catalogs covering decades of observations, they do not provide the associated type-II luminosity. Besides, since radio burst emission could be beamed, the observed flux dynamic spectrum may vary with line of sight. Using long-term calibrated decameter-hectometric dynamic spectra from the Wind and STEREO spacecraft, we build a catalog of multi-vantage point observations of type-II bursts. Cross-matching with existing catalogs we compile the properties of the associated flare, reconnection, and the CME. Cross-correlation analysis was done between various parameters. Two novel metrics of flare and CME power show a strong correlation revealing a link between particle acceleration strengths in the low-corona and IP space.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Key Factors in the Solar Eruptions Leading to the Solar Superstorm in 2024 May</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NOAA Active Region (AR) 13664/8 produced the most intense geomagnetic effects since the ``Halloween'' event of 2003. The resulting extreme solar storm is believed to be the consequence of multiple interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Notably, this AR exhibites an exceptionally rapid magnetic flux emergence. The eruptions we are focusing on all occurred along collisional polarity inversion lines (PILs) through ``collisional shearing'' during a three-day period of extraordinarily high flux emergence ($\sim$10$^{21}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$). Our key findings reveal how photospheric magnetic configurations in eruption sources influence solar superstorm formation and geomagnetic responses, and link exceptionally strong flux emergence to sequential homologous eruptions: (1) We identified the source regions of seven halo CMEs, distributed primarily along two distinct PILs, suggesting the presence of two groups of homologous CMEs. (2) The variations in magnetic flux emergence rates at the source regions correlate with CME intensities, potentially explaining the two contrasting cases of complex ejecta observed at Earth. (3) Calculations of magnetic field gradients around CME source regions show strong correlations with eruptions, providing crucial insights into solar eruption mechanisms and enhancing future prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>JWST captures a sudden stellar outburst and inner disk wall destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.</description>

      <title>The Compositions of Rocky Planets in Close-in Orbits Tend to be Earth-Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hundreds of exoplanets between 1-1.8 times the size of the Earth have been discovered on close in orbits. However, these planets show such a diversity in densities that some appear to be made entirely of iron, while others appear to host gaseous envelopes. To test this diversity in composition, we update the masses of 5 rocky exoplanets (HD 93963 A b, Kepler-10 b, Kepler-100 b, Kepler-407 b, and TOI-1444 b) and present the confirmation of a new planet (TOI-1011) using 187 high precision RVs from Gemini/MAROON-X and Keck/KPF. Our updated planet masses suggest compositions closer to that of the Earth than previous literature values for all planets in our sample. In particular, we report that two previously identified ``super-Mercuries'' (Kepler-100 b and HD 93963 A b) have lower masses that suggest less iron-rich compositions. We then compare the ratio of iron to rock-building species to the abundance ratios of those elements in their host stars. These updated planet compositions do not suggest a steep relationship between planet and host star compositions, contradictory to previous results, and suggest that planets and host stars have similar abundance ratios.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barnard's star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTO) as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the $\alpha$ Centauri stellar system. We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO observations of Barnard's star carried out over four years with the goal of exploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone (HZ). Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model stellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200d and confirms stellar activity due to rotation at 140d as the dominant source of radial velocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on publicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not support the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233d. After subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period candidate planet signals at periods of 3.15d, 4.12d, 2.34d, and 6.74d. We confirm the 3.15d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of $55 \pm 7$cm/s, leading to a planet minimum mass $m_p \sin i$ of $0.37 \pm 0.05$Mearth, which is about three times the mass of Mars. ESPRESSO RVs suggest the possible existence of a candidate system with four sub-Earth mass planets in circular orbits with semi-amplitudes from 20 to 47cm/s, thus corresponding to minimum masses in the range of 0.17-0.32Mearth. The sub-Earth mass planet at $3.1533 \pm 0.0006$d is in a close-to circular orbit with a semi-major axis of $0.0229 \pm 0.0003$AU, thus located inwards from the HZ of Barnard's star, with an equilibrium temperature of 400K. Additional ESPRESSO observations would be required to confirm that the other three candidate signals originate from a compact short-period planet system orbiting Barnard's star inwards from its HZ.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star: No evidence of transits in TESS photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At a similar time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root-mean-square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>

      <title>Millimetre observations of the S-type AGB star $\chi$ Cygni: variability of the emission of the inner envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New observations are presented of millimetre line emissions of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB star $\chi$ Cygni using the recently upgraded NOEMA array. $\chi$ Cygni is an S-type Mira variable, at the border between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, that has been observed for over 40 years to display features giving evidence for the strong role played by pulsation-associated shock waves in the generation of its wind. The new observations give evidence for a bright H$^{12}$CN(3-2) line emission confined to the very close neighbourhood of the star, however significantly more extended in 2024 than in 2023. Interpretation of such variability in terms of maser emission is considered but found to raise significant unanswered questions. Moreover, other unexpected features are observed in the very close neighbourhood of the star, including low Si$^{16}$O(6-5)/Si$^{17}$O(6-5), $^{28}$SiO(5-4)/$^{29}$SiO(5-4) and $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1) line emission ratios. Possibly confirming the important role played by shocks, we discuss a measurement of the SiO(5-4)/SiO(6-5) emission ratio, evidence for a recent mass ejection particularly enhanced in the north-western red-shifted octant of the circumstellar envelope, leaving a depression of emission in its wake, and patterns of enhanced CO(2-1) line-emission suggesting an interpretation in terms of episodic outflows enhanced over solid angles associated with the surface of convective cells and on a time scale of a few decades. Unravelling the mechanisms underlying such newly observed features is very challenging and confirmation of the reported observations with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would be highly welcome. Observation of SiO maser emission in the ($\nu$=1,$J$=6-5) transition is reported for the first time.</description>

      <title>Precision orbital dynamics from interstellar scintillation arcs for PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.12757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity scintillations of radio pulsars are known to originate from interference between waves scattered by the electron density irregularities of interstellar plasma, often leading to parabolic arcs in the two-dimensional power spectrum of the recorded dynamic spectrum. The degree of arc curvature depends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity with respect to the line-of-sight. We report the observation of annual and orbital variations in the curvature of scintillation arcs over a period of 16 years for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations are the signature of the relative transverse motions of the Earth, pulsar, and scattering medium, which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters of the pulsar's binary orbit and the scattering medium itself. We observe two clear scintillation arcs in most of our $&gt;$5000 observations and we show that they originate from scattering by thin screens located at distances $D_1 = 89.8 \pm 0.4$ pc and $D_2 = 124 \pm 3$ pc from Earth. The best-fit scattering model we derive for the brightest arc yields the pulsar's orbital inclination angle $i = 137.1 \pm 0.3^\circ$, and longitude of ascending node, $\Omega=206.3\pm0.4^\circ$. Using scintillation arcs for precise astrometry and orbital dynamics can be superior to modelling variations in the diffractive scintillation timescale, because the arc curvature is independent of variations in the level of turbulence of interstellar plasma. This technique can be used in combination with pulsar timing to determine the full three-dimensional orbital geometries of binary pulsars, and provides parameters essential for testing theories of gravity and constraining neutron star masses.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

Abstract: Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of $1.8 - 2.3$kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] $\leq -0.5$). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of $20 \pm 4$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (a transverse velocity of 214 km s$^{-1}$ at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.</description>
