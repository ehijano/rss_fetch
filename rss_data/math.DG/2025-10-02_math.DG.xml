      <title>Notes on the Geometry of Electromagnetic Fields and Maxwell's Equations along a non-null curves in non flat-3D space forms $M_{q}^{3}(c)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the directional derivatives in accordance with the orthonormal frame {T, N, B} are defined in $M_{q}^{3}(c)$, and the extended Serret-Frenet relations by using Frenet formulas are expressed. Furthermore, we express the bending elastic energy function for the same particle in $M_{q}^{3}(c)$ according to curve $\alpha (s,\xi ,\eta )$ and geometrical interpretation of the energy for unit vector fields and we also solve Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic field vectors in $M_{q}^{3}(c).$</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the asymptotic limits for Ricci-flat manifolds with linear volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under natural assumptions on curvature and cross section, we establish the uniqueness of asymptotic limits and the exponential convergence rate for complete noncollapsed Ricci-flat manifolds with linear volume growth, which are known to only admit cylindrical asymptotic limits. In dimension four, these assumptions hold automatically, yielding unconditional uniqueness and convergence. In particular, our results show that all asymptotically cylindrical Calabi--Yau manifolds converge exponentially to their asymptotic limits, thereby answering affirmatively a question by Haskins--Hein--Nordstr\"om. In dimension four our result strengthens those of Chen--Chen, who proved exponential convergence to its asymptotic limit space for any ALH instanton.</description>

      <title>Extension of a problem of Euler in $\mathbb{H}^2$ and in $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of stationary curves with respect to the moment of inertia from a point $N$ in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the case that the ambient space is either the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ or the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. We characterize the critical points of this energy in terms of the curvature of the curve and the distance to $N$. In $\mathbb{H}^2$, we prove that the only closed stationary curves are circles centered at $N$. In $\mathbb{S}^2$, we estimate the value of $\alpha$ for closed curves according to the hemisphere of $\mathbb{S}^2$ in which the curve lies. In addition, we find the first integrals of the ODEs that describe the parametrizations of stationary curves in both ambient spaces. Finally, we consider the energy minimization problem for curves connecting two points collinear with $N$, in particular solving the case of geodesics.</description>

      <title>A Simplification of the Aubin-Yau Proof and a New $C^{0}$ Estimate for the Monge-Amp\`ere Equation on Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a simplified exposition of the celebrated Aubin-Yau proof for the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics is provided. For the case of a compact K\"ahler manifold with vanishing first Chern class, we improve Yau's celebrated $C^0$ a priori estimate. Instead of relying on the $L^{\infty}$ norm of the K\"ahler potential $F$ as in the original proof, we establish a new uniform bound for the solution to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation that depends only on the $L^{p}$ norm of $e^{F}$. This new approach to the $C^0$ estimate offers an alternative method for establishing uniform bounds for solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations.</description>

      <title>Approximate mean curvature flows of a general varifold, and their limit spacetime Brakke flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a construction of mean curvature flows by approximation for very general initial data, in the spirit of the works of Brakke and of Kim &amp; Tonegawa based on the theory of varifolds. Given a general varifold, we construct by iterated push-forwards an approximate time-discrete mean curvature flow depending on both a given time step and an approximation parameter. We show that, as the time step tends to $0$, this time-discrete flow converges to a unique limit flow, which we call the approximate mean curvature flow. An interesting feature of our approach is its generality, as it provides an approximate notion of mean curvature flow for very general structures of any dimension and codimension, ranging from continuous surfaces to discrete point clouds. We prove that our approximate mean curvature flow satisfies several properties: stability, uniqueness, Brakke-type equality, mass decay. By coupling this approximate flow with the canonical time measure, we prove convergence, as the approximation parameter tends to $0$, to a spacetime limit measure whose generalized mean curvature is bounded. Under an additional rectifiability assumption, we further prove that this limit measure is a spacetime Brakke flow.</description>

      <title>A semi-symmetric metric connection, perfect fluid space-time and phantom barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection and its application. The Ricci tensors with respect to the concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection are symmetric, and they are used to define Einstein type manifolds. In this way, conditions under which a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is quasi-Einstein are obtained. On a Lorentzian manifold, a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection with a unit timelike generator becomes a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection, and a Lorentzian manifold becomes a GRW space-time. The scalar curvature of a perfect fluid space-time with that connection is not constant in the general case. By applying previously established results for quasi-Einstein manifolds, we examine the cases when the scalar curvature is constant. Furthermore, an application to the theory of relativity is presented, and the value of the equation of state is examined. It is ultimately shown that the equation of state in a perfect fluid space-time that satisfies Einstein field equation with cosmological constant and admits a unit timelike torse-forming vector represents a phantom barrier.</description>

      <title>The exterior derivative and the mean value equality in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey revisits classical results in vector calculus and analysis by exploring a generalised perspective on the exterior derivative, interpreting it as a measure of "infinitesimal flux". This viewpoint leads to a higher-dimensional analogue of the Mean Value Theorem, valid for differential $k$-forms, and provides a natural formulation of Stokes' theorem that mirrors the exact hypotheses of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - without requiring full $C^1$ smoothness of the differential form.
  As a numerical application, we propose an algorithm for exterior differentiation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that relies solely on black-box access to the differential form, offering a practical tool for computation without the need for mesh discretization or explicit symbolic expressions.</description>

      <title>The Enriquez connection for higher genus polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the variation of the Enriquez connection for higher genus polylogarithms under degenerations of Riemann surfaces with marked points, and show that this connection becomes the connection constructed by the author for degenerating families of pointed Riemann surfaces. Therefore, we have an important application that the higher genus polylogarithms derived from the Enriquez connection can be described explicitly as power series in deformation parameters and their logarithms associated with the families whose coefficients are expressed by multiple zeta values.</description>

      <title>Compactness of conformal metrics with constant $Q$-curvature of higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k\ge1$ be a positive integer and let $P_g$ be the GJMS operator $P_{g}$ of order $2k$ on a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n&gt;2k$. We investigate the compactness of the set of conformal metrics to $g$ with prescribed constant positive $Q$-curvature of order $2k$- or, equivalently, of the set of positive solutions for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation. Under a natural positivity-preserving condition on $P_{g}$ we establish compactness, for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, under the following assumptions: $(M,g)$ is locally conformally flat and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $2k+1 \le n \le 2k+5$ and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $n \ge 2k+4$ and $|\text{W}_g|_g &gt;0$ in $M$.
  For an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the expression of $P_g$ is not explicit, which is an obstacle to proving compactness. We overcome this by relying on Juhl's celebrated recursive formulae for $P_g$ to perform a refined blow-up analysis for solutions of the $Q$-curvature equation and to prove a Weyl vanishing result for $P_g$. This is the first compactness result for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$ and the first successful instance where Juhl's formulae are used to yield compactness. Our result also hints that the threshold dimension for compactness for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation diverges as $k \to + \infty$.</description>

      <title>The Tits alternative for visibility spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on a visibility CAT(0) space $X$ that satisfies the bounded packing property. We prove that $\Gamma$ satisfies the Tits alternative: it is either almost nilpotent or contains a free nonabelian subgroup of rank $2$. In the former case, it is equivalent to that the cardinality of the limit set of $\Gamma$ in the geometric boundary of $X$ is no greater than $2$. As an application of the Tits alternative, we show that any finitely generated torsion group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on such a space must be a finite group and have a global fixed point.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic systole of Seifert surfaces and distortion of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Gromov introduced the notion of distortion of a knot, and asked if there are knots with arbitrarily large distortion. In 2011, Pardon proved that the distortion of $T_{p,q}$ is at least $\min\{p,q\}$ up to a constant factor. We prove that the distortion of $T_{p, p+1}\# K$ is at least $p$ up to a constant, independent of $K$. We also prove that any embedding of a minimal genus Seifert surface for $T_{p,p+1}\# K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has small extrinsic systole, in the sense that it contains a non-contractible loop with small $\mathbb{R}^3$-diameter relative to the length of the knot. These results are related to combinatorial properties of the monodromy map associated to torus knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex manifold. Assume that $Y\subset X$ is a K\"{a}hler submanifold such that $X\setminus Y$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that $(X, Y)$ is biholomorphic to the standard example $(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathbb{P}^{n-1})$. We then study certain K\"{a}hler orbifold compactifications of $\mathbb{C}^n$ and, as an application, prove that on $\mathbb{C}^3$ the flat metric is the only asymptotically conical Ricci-flat K\"{a}hler metric whose metric cone at infinity has a smooth link. As a key technical ingredient, we derive a new characterization of minimal discrepancy of isolated Fano cone singularities by using $S^1$-equivariant positive symplectic homology.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Compact Dupin Hypersurfaces with Non-constant Lie Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypersurface $M$ in the unit sphere $S^n \subset {\bf R}^{n+1}$ is Dupin if along each curvature surface of $M$, the corresponding principal curvature is constant. If the number $g$ of distinct principal curvatures is constant on $M$, then $M$ is called proper Dupin. In this expository paper, we give a detailed description of two important types of constructions of compact proper Dupin hypersurfaces in $S^n$. One construction was published in 1989 by Pinkall and Thorbergsson, and the second was published in 1989 by Miyaoka and Ozawa. Both types of examples have the property that they do not have constant Lie curvatures (Lie invariants discovered by Miyaoka), which are the cross-ratios of the principal curvatures, taken four at a time. Thus, these examples are not equivalent by a Lie sphere transformation to an isoparametric (constant principal curvatures) hypersurface in $S^n$. So they are counterexamples to a conjecture of Cecil and Ryan in 1985 that every compact proper Dupin hypersurface in $S^n$ is equivalent to an isoparametric hypersurface by a Lie sphere transformation.</description>

Abstract: This is a survey of the twistor lifts of surfaces in 4-spaces. In most part of this survey, the space is the Euclidean $4$-space $E^4$. The definitions of the Gauss maps and the twistor lifts of surfaces in $E^4$ are given by complex structures of $E^4$. Based on these definitions, we can understand that the Gauss maps of minimal surfaces are holomorphic and characterize isotropicity of minimal surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction strength I(X) of a compact hyperbolic surface X is the best upper bound for the intersection number of two closed geodesics divided by the product of their lengths. Let $M_g$ be the moduli space of compact hyperbolic surfaces of genus g and sys(X) the length of a shortest closed geodesic on $X \in M_g$. We determine the asymptotic behavior of I(X), as $X \to \infty$ in $M_g$, in terms of sys(X). We also determine the approximate behavior of the minimum of I(X) over $M_g$, as $g \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Minimality of level sets in phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove minimality of the zero level set with respect to a certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In addition, we obtain that the zero level set of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation has zero mean curvature. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture in it's original statement, without the limiting assumption of O. Savin, by reducing it to classical Bernstein type results for minimal graphs, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>

      <title>On the volume of K-semistable Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the anti-canonical volume of an $n$-dimensional K-semistable Fano manifold that is not $\mathbb{P}^n$ is at most $2n^n$. Moreover, the volume is equal to $2n^n$ if and only if $X\cong \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ or $X$ is a smooth quadric hypersurface $Q\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}$. Our proof is based on a new connection between K-semistability and minimal rational curves.</description>

      <title>LoRA meets Riemannion: Muon Optimizer for Parametrization-independent Low-Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel, fully Riemannian framework for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that geometrically treats low-rank adapters by optimizing them directly on the fixed-rank manifold. This formulation eliminates the parametrization ambiguity present in standard Euclidean optimizers. Our framework integrates three key components to achieve this: (1) we derive Riemannion, a new Riemannian optimizer on the fixed-rank matrix manifold that generalizes the recently proposed Muon optimizer; (2) we develop a Riemannian gradient-informed LoRA initialization, and (3) we provide an efficient implementation without prominent overhead that uses automatic differentiation to compute arising geometric operations while adhering to best practices in numerical linear algebra. Comprehensive experimental results on both LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that our approach yields consistent and noticeable improvements in convergence speed and final task performance over both standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.</description>
