      <title>Kullback-Leibler cluster entropy to quantify volatility correlation and risk diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler cluster entropy $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ is evaluated for the empirical and model probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ of the clusters formed in the realized volatility time series of five assets (SP\&amp;500, NASDAQ, DJIA, DAX, FTSEMIB). The Kullback-Leibler functional $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ provides complementary perspectives about the stochastic volatility process compared to the Shannon functional $\mathcal{S_{C}}[P]$. While $\mathcal{D_{C}}[P \| Q] $ is maximum at the short time scales, $\mathcal{S_{C}}[P]$ is maximum at the large time scales leading to complementary optimization criteria tracing back respectively to the maximum and minimum relative entropy evolution principles. The realized volatility is modelled as a time-dependent fractional stochastic process characterized by power-law decaying distributions with positive correlation ($H&gt;1/2$). As a case study, a multiperiod portfolio built on diversity indexes derived from the Kullback-Leibler entropy measure of the realized volatility. The portfolio is robust and exhibits better performances over the horizon periods. A comparison with the portfolio built either according to the uniform distribution or in the framework of the Markowitz theory is also reported.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic properties of equity markets: stylized facts and portfolio performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic properties of equity markets affect the performance of active equity strategies but many are not adequately captured by conventional models of financial mathematics and econometrics. Using the CRSP Database of the US equity market, we study empirically several macroscopic properties defined in terms of market capitalizations and returns, and highlight a list of stylized facts and open questions motivated in part by stochastic portfolio theory. Additionally, we present a systematic backtest of the diversity-weighted portfolio under various configurations and study its performance in relation to macroscopic quantities. All of our results can be replicated using codes made available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Tuning into Climate Risks: Extracting Innovation from Television News for Clean Energy Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops multiple novel climate risk measures (or variables) based on the television news coverage by Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business, and examines how they affect the systematic and idiosyncratic risks of clean energy firms in the United States. The measures are built on climate related keywords and cover the volume of coverage, type of coverage (climate crisis, renewable energy, and government &amp; human initiatives), and media sentiments. We show that an increase in the aggregate measure of climate risk, as indicated by coverage volume, reduces idiosyncratic risk while increasing systematic risk. When climate risk is segregated, we find that systematic risk is positively affected by the physical risk of climate crises and transition risk from government &amp; human initiatives, but no such impact is evident for idiosyncratic risk. Additionally, we observe an asymmetry in risk behavior: negative sentiments tend to increase idiosyncratic risk and decrease systematic risk, while positive sentiments have no significant impact. These findings remain robust to including print media and climate policy uncertainty variables, though some deviations are noted during the COVID-19 period.</description>

      <title>Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals: A Statistical Jump Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at mitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated unfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for market regime identification, a recently developed robust model that distinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing regime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our JM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely from the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a time-series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy performance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample performance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany, and Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading delays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided strategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and enhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both hidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These findings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of strategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.</description>
