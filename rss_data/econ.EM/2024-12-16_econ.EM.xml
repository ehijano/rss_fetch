      <title>A Neyman-Orthogonalization Approach to the Incidental Parameter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular approach to perform inference on a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters is to construct estimating equations that are orthogonal to the nuisance parameters, in the sense that their expected first derivative is zero. Such first-order orthogonalization may, however, not suffice when the nuisance parameters are very imprecisely estimated. Leading examples where this is the case are models for panel and network data that feature fixed effects. In this paper, we show how, in the conditional-likelihood setting, estimating equations can be constructed that are orthogonal to any chosen order. Combining these equations with sample splitting yields higher-order bias-corrected estimators of target parameters. In an empirical application we apply our method to a fixed-effect model of team production and obtain estimates of complementarity in production and impacts of counterfactual re-allocations.</description>

      <title>Identifying causal effects with subjective ordinal outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survey questions often ask respondents to select from ordered scales where the meanings of the categories are subjective, leaving each individual free to apply their own definitions when answering. This paper studies the use of these responses as an outcome variable in causal inference, accounting for variation in the interpretation of categories across individuals. I find that when a continuous treatment is statistically independent of both i) potential outcomes; and ii) heterogeneity in reporting styles, a nonparametric regression of response category number on that treatment variable recovers a quantity proportional to an average causal effect among individuals who are on the margin between successive response categories. The magnitude of a given regression coefficient is not meaningful on its own, but the ratio of local regression derivatives with respect to two such treatment variables identifies the relative magnitudes of convex averages of their effects. I find that comparisons involving discrete treatment variables are not as readily interpretable, but obtain a partial identification result for such cases under additional assumptions. I illustrate the results by revisiting the effects of income comparisons on subjective well-being, without assuming cardinality or interpersonal comparability of responses.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Inference for Regression-Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) are often estimated using local regression methods. \cite{Hahn:01} demonstrated that the identification of the average treatment effect at the cutoff in RDDs relies on the unconfoundedness assumption and that, without this assumption, only the local average treatment effect at the cutoff can be identified. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric framework tailored for identifying the average treatment effect in RDDs, eliminating the need for the unconfoundedness assumption. Our approach globally conceptualizes the identification as a partially linear modeling problem, with the coefficient of a specified polynomial function of propensity score in the linear component capturing the average treatment effect. This identification result underpins our semiparametric inference for RDDs, employing the $P$-spline method to approximate the nonparametric function and establishing a procedure for conducting inference within this framework. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our global approach achieves a faster convergence rate compared to the local method. Monte Carlo simulations further confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms alternatives across various scenarios. Furthermore, applications to real-world datasets illustrate that our global approach can provide more reliable inference for practical problems.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Potential Outcomes and Causal Mixture Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous data from multiple populations, sub-groups, or sources is often represented as a ``mixture model'' with a single latent class influencing all of the observed covariates. Heterogeneity can be resolved at multiple levels by grouping populations according to different notions of similarity. This paper proposes grouping with respect to the causal response of an intervention or perturbation on the system. This definition is distinct from previous notions, such as similar covariate values (e.g. clustering) or similar correlations between covariates (e.g. Gaussian mixture models). To solve the problem, we ``synthetically sample'' from a counterfactual distribution using higher-order multi-linear moments of the observable data. To understand how these ``causal mixtures'' fit in with more classical notions, we develop a hierarchy of mixture identifiability.</description>

      <title>Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment: a review of selected NICE technology appraisals in oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Surrogate endpoints, used to substitute for and predict final clinical outcomes, are increasingly being used to support submissions to health technology assessment agencies. The increase in use of surrogate endpoints has been accompanied by literature describing frameworks and statistical methods to ensure their robust validation. The aim of this review was to assess how surrogate endpoints have recently been used in oncology technology appraisals by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.
  Methods: This paper identified technology appraisals in oncology published by NICE between February 2022 and May 2023. Data are extracted on methods for the use and validation of surrogate endpoints.
  Results: Of the 47 technology appraisals in oncology available for review, 18 (38 percent) utilised surrogate endpoints, with 37 separate surrogate endpoints being discussed. However, the evidence supporting the validity of the surrogate relationship varied significantly across putative surrogate relationships with 11 providing RCT evidence, 7 providing evidence from observational studies, 12 based on clinical opinion and 7 providing no evidence for the use of surrogate endpoints.
  Conclusions: This review supports the assertion that surrogate endpoints are frequently used in oncology technology appraisals in England and Wales. Despite increasing availability of statistical methods and guidance on appropriate validation of surrogate endpoints, this review highlights that use and validation of surrogate endpoints can vary between technology appraisals which can lead to uncertainty in decision-making.</description>
