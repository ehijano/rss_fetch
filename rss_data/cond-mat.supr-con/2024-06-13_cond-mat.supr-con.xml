      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Quantum Spin Hall Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a magneto-electric phenomenon where an external magnetic field imparts a non-zero center-of-mass momentum to Cooper pairs, either facilitating or hindering the flow of supercurrent depending on its direction. We propose that quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI)-based Josephson junctions can serve as versatile platforms for non-dissipative electronics exhibiting the SDE when triggered by a phase bias and an out-of-plane magnetic field. By computing the contributions from Andreev bound states and the continuum of quasi-particle states, we provide both numerical and analytical results scrutinizing various aspects of the SDE, including its quality Q-factor. The maximum value of the $Q$-factor is found to be universal at low (zero) temperatures, which ties its origin to underlying topological properties that are independent of the junction's specific details. As the magnetic field increases, the SDE diminishes due to the closing of the induced superconducting gap caused by orbital effects. To observe the SDE, the QSHI-based Josephson junction must be designed so that its edges are transport-wise non-equivalent. Additionally, we explore the SDE in a more exotic yet realistic scenario, where the fermionic ground-state parity of the Josephson junction remains conserved while driving a current. In this 4$\pi$-periodic situation, we predict an enhancement of the SDE compared to its 2$\pi$-periodic, parity-unconstrained counterpart.</description>

      <title>Linear spectroscopy of collective modes and the gap structure in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes, can be detected in linear response. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via gate electrodes; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Lastly, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2|\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Growth and characterization of the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films: dominant contribution of the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the pulsed-laser-ablation technique, we have successfully grown the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films with $c$-axis orientation perpendicular to the film surface. X-ray diffraction shows that the (00l) peaks can be well indexed to the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ phase. Resistive measurements show that the samples can be tuned from weak insulating to metallic behavior through adjusting the growth conditions. Surprisingly, all curves of $\rho-T$ in the temperature region of 2$\sim$300~K do not show the anomalies corresponding to either the spin density wave or the charge density wave orders as seen in bulk samples. Hall effect measurements show a linear field dependence with the dominant hole charge carriers, but the Hall coefficient $R_{H}=\rho_{xy}/H$ exhibits strong temperature dependence. The magnetoresistance above about 50~K is positive but very weak, indicating the absence of multiband effect. However, a negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures, which shows the delocalization effect. Detailed analysis on the magnetoresistance suggests that the delocalization effect at low temperatures is due to the Kondo-like effect, rather than the Anderson weak localization. Our transport results suggest that, the electronic conduction is fulfilled by the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital with holes as the dominant charge carriers, while the interaction through Hund's coupling with the localized $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital plays an important role in the charge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Superconductor bistable vortex memory for data storage and in-memory computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor electronics (SCE) is a promising complementary and beyond CMOS technology. However, despite its practical benefits, the realization of SCE logic faces a significant challenge due to the absence of dense and scalable nonvolatile memory designs. While various nonvolatile memory technologies, including Non-destructive readout, vortex transitional memory (VTM), and magnetic memory, have been explored, achieving a superconductor random-access memory (RAM) crossbar array remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable VTM cell design for SCE applications. Our proposed design addresses scaling issues while boasting zero static power consumption characteristics. Our design leverages current summation, enabling analog multiply-accumulate operations -an essential feature for many in-memory computational tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a 32 x 32 superconductor memory array operating at 20 GHz. This design effectively addresses scaling issues and utilizes current summation that can be used for analog multiply-accumulate operations. Additionally, we showcase the accumulation property of the memory through analog simulations conducted on an 8 x 8 superconductor crossbar array.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>

      <title>Standard Superconductivity in Carbonaceous Sulfur Hydride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered room temperature superconductivity (RTSC) in carbonaceous sulfur hydride reveals the promise of a new superconducting technological era. Since the publication of that report, there has been discussion and debate about this technology. In particular, Hirsch et al. argue that all the recently discovered superconducting hydrides are incorrect, incorrectly interpreted, or point to BCS theory being wrong. A recent publication regarding the RTSC discovery argues that more detailed information about the RTSC discovery is needed. This manuscript aims to respond to this concern by providing the raw data under question as well as providing discussion regarding other aspects of this new RTSC for the sake of the broader scientific community.</description>

      <title>Anomalous supercurrent and diode effect in locally perturbed topological Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry can lead to peculiar effects in Josephson junctions, such as the anomalous Josephson effect or supercurrent rectification, which is a dissipationless analog of the diode effect. Due to their impact in new quantum technologies, it is important to find robust platforms and external means to manipulate the above effects in a controlled way. Here, we theoretically consider a Josephson junction based on a quantum spin Hall system as the normal channel, subjected to a magnetic field in the direction defined by spin-momentum locking, and in presence of a local tip in close proximity to one of the metallic edges in the normal region. We consider different local perturbations, model normal and magnetic tips, and study how they affect the Josephson response of the device. In particular, we argue that magnetic tips are a useful tool that allows for tunability of both $\phi_0$ response and supercurrent rectification.</description>

      <title>Flat Band Josephson Junctions with Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider superconductor/flat band material/superconductor (S/FB/S) Josephson junctions (JJs) where the flat band material possesses isolated flat bands with exactly zero Fermi velocity. Contrary to conventional S/N/S JJs where the critical Josephson current vanishes when the Fermi velocity goes to zero, we show in this work that the critical current in the S/FB/S junction is controlled by the quantum metric length $\xi_\mathrm{QM}$ of the flat bands. Microscopically, when $\xi_\mathrm{QM}$ of the flat band is long enough, the interface bound states originally localized at the two S/FB, FB/S interfaces can penetrate deeply into the flat band material and hybridize to form Andreev bound states (ABSs). These ABSs are able to carry long range and sizable supercurrents. Importantly, $\xi_\mathrm{QM}$ also controls how far the proximity effect can penetrate into the flat band material. This stands in sharp contrast to the de Gennes' theory for S/N junctions which predicts that the proximity effect is expected to be zero when the Fermi velocity of the normal metal is zero. We further suggest that the S/FB/S junctions would give rise to a new type of resonant Josephson transistors which can carry sizable and highly gate-tunable supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption in tilted geometries as an indirect measurement of longitudinal plasma waves in layered cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in a layered superconductor with arbitrary momentum with respect to the main crystallographic directions display an unavoidable mixing between longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. Here we show that this basic physical mechanism explains the emergence of a well-defined absorption peak in the in-plane optical conductivity for light propagating at small tilting angles with respect to the stacking direction in layered cuprates. More specifically, we show that this peak, often interpreted as a spurious leakage of the $c$-axis Josephson plasmon, is instead a signature of the true longitudinal plasma mode occurring at larger momenta. By combining a classical approach based on Maxwell's equations with a full quantum derivation of the plasma modes based on the modelling of the superconducting phase degrees of freedom, we provide an analytical expression for the absorption peak as a function of the tilting angle and light polarization. We suggest that an all-optical measurement in tilted geometry can be used as an alternative way to access plasma-wave dispersion, usually measured by means of large-momenta scattering techniques like resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).</description>

      <title>A two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03208v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains can be used to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this work, we realize a two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electrongas by coupling two quantum dots through a region proximitized by a superconductor. We demonstrate systematic control over inter-dot couplings through in-plane rotations of the magnetic field and via electrostatic gating of the proximitized region. This allows us to tune the system to sweet spots in parameter space, where robust correlated zero bias conductance peaks are observed in tunnelling spectroscopy. To study the extent of hybridization between localized MBSs, we probe the evolution of the energy spectrum with magnetic field and estimate the Majorana polarization, an important metric for Majorana-based qubits. The implementation of a Kitaev chain on a scalable and flexible 2D platform provides a realistic path towards more advanced experiments that require manipulation and readout of multiple MBSs.</description>
