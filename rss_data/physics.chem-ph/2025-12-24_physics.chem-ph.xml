      <title>A generalized rate law for inhomogeneous system and turbulence-chemistry decoupling of reaction rate calculation in combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the rate law for inhomogeneous concentration distributions has been formulated, by applying spatial integration over the products of species concentrations. Reaction rates for typical reactions have been investigated by assuming a linear concentration distribution in the grid. A few examples of one-dimensional concentration distributions, straight line, piecewise, and sine function, for a selected second order reaction have been taken to illustrate the validations of the method developed. Difference between the reaction rates by spatial integration and by mean concentrations have been discussed. It is revealed that the chemical reaction rates for combustion simulation can be calculated by appropriate sub-grid modeling of concentration distributions, without needs of the explicit consideration of turbulent combustion interactions, and the reaction rates for the species transport equation in turbulent combustion simulations can be accurately calculated if the concentration distributions of species within the grid are correctly defined.</description>

      <title>Singlet Fission among two Single Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is a photophysical process where a singlet excitation generates two triplet excited states, enhancing exciton multiplication potentially useful for solar energy conversion. Since SF typically outcompetes radiative decay, single molecule studies of SF have remained elusive. Here, we present single molecule spectroscopy of a terrylenediimide (TDI) dimer at room and cryogenic temperatures. By analysing the stream of photons emitted by single dimers, the rates of formation and decay of SF-born triplet states were determined. We report considerable static and dynamic heterogeneities of the SF process which are reflected in broad rate distributions as well as the occasional occurrence of delayed fluorescence and rate fluctuations during spin evolution. Cryogenic experiments point to the formation of a coherent multiexciton superposition state which decays into the singlet exciton from which a correlated triplet pair evolves. Our results establish single molecule spectroscopy as a new avenue into mechanistic details of the SF process which often are drowned by ensemble av-eraging.</description>

      <title>Maximum Diminished Sombor Index of Molecular Trees with a Perfect Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diminished Sombor index $(DSO)$ of a graph $G$, introduced by Rajathagiri, is defined as $$DSO(G)=\sum_{uv\in E}\frac{\sqrt{d_u^2+d_v^2}}{d_u+d_v},$$ where $d_u$ and $d_v$ are the degrees of vertices $u$ and $v$. A graph $G$ is a molecular graph if $d_G(u)\leq 4$ for all $u\in V(G)$. In this paper, we examine the chemical applicability of the $DSO$ index for predicting physicochemical properties of octane isomers. We also determine the maximum value of the diminished Sombor index among all molecular trees of order $n$ with perfect matching and characterize all the corresponding extremal trees.</description>

      <title>Chemically-Informed Machine Learning Approach for Prediction of Reactivity Ratios in Radical Copolymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting monomer reactivity ratios is crucial for controlling monomer sequence distribution in copolymers and their properties. Traditional experimental methods of determining reactivity ratios are time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing computational methods often struggle with accuracy or scalability. Here, we present a method that combines unsupervised learning with artificial neural networks to predict reactivity ratios in radical copolymerization. By applying spectral clustering to physicochemical features of monomers, we identified three distinct monomer groups with characteristic reactivity patterns. This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes. However, models utilizing complete datasets outperformed specialized models trained on focused subsets, revealing a fundamental trade-off between chemical specificity and data availability. This work demonstrates that unsupervised learning offers rapid chemical insight for exploratory analysis, while supervised learning provides the accuracy necessary for final design predictions, with optimal strategies depending on data availability and application requirements.</description>

      <title>NMIRacle: Multi-modal Generative Molecular Elucidation from IR and NMR Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectroscopic data is a long-standing challenge in Chemistry, traditionally requiring expert interpretation. We introduce NMIRacle, a two-stage generative framework that builds upon recent paradigms in AI-driven spectroscopy with minimal assumptions. In the first stage, NMIRacle learns to reconstruct molecular structures from count-aware fragment encodings, which capture both fragment identities and their occurrences. In the second stage, a spectral encoder maps input spectroscopic measurements (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) into a latent embedding that conditions the pre-trained generator. This formulation bridges fragment-level chemical modeling with spectral evidence, yielding accurate molecular predictions. Empirical results show that NMIRacle outperforms existing baselines on molecular elucidation, while maintaining robust performance across increasing levels of molecular complexity.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Simulations of EMI-BF4 Neutral-Surface Interactions in Electrospray Thrusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospray thrusters promise compact, high specific impulse propulsion for small spacecraft, yet ground characterization remains confounded by secondary species emission and incomplete diagnostics of neutral products. To address these limitations, we perform energy-resolved mixed quantum/classical (QM/MM) ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) of neutral 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, EMI-BF4, colliding with Au extractor surfaces with impact energies from 10 to 100 eV to resolve fragment species spectra, charge states, kinetic energy partitioning, and scattering geometry. The simulations reveal a three-stage sequence with impact energy: the low energy regime, 10 to 20 eV, which favors ionic dissociation, intermediate energy regime, between 30 to 40 eV, opens a neutralization window, and high energy regime, greater than 50 eV, drives covalent fragmentation into many light products with mixed charge states. Fractional energy distributions show a transition from few-body, energy-concentrated outcomes in the low energy regime to many-body, energy-dispersed outcomes in the high energy regime. Deflection angle distributions exhibit a strong mass-to-angle anti-correlation such that heavier fragments favor small deflection, whereas lighter fragments populate larger deflection angles. The fraction of transient metastables peaks near 50 eV, coinciding with abundant neutral fragment production. Importantly, neutral bombardment still produces charged secondaries at the target even when the upstream ion plume is fully suppressed by a decelerating electrode. These findings provide a basis for de-biasing facility measurements by pairing tandem time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and residual gas analyzer with suppression-bias corrections to inform the design of electrospray thrusters that reduce interception and contamination on extractor surfaces.</description>

      <title>Phantom LAM and LLI: Resistance and Hysteresis Bias in Voltage-Curve Degradation Mode Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degradation mode analysis (DMA) is widely used to decompose capacity fade into loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active material (LAM) from low-rate voltage-capacity data. Yet the measured trace is a pseudo-OCV (pOCV) that includes two non-degradation contributions: an SOC-dependent ohmic drop and intrinsic charge-discharge hysteresis, especially in graphite--silicon oxide (C/SiOx) negative electrodes. We show these can dominate attribution and generate Phantom LAM/LLI --apparent material loss created by curve registration, branch choice and voltage-windowing rather than true degradation. Using two commercial 21700 cells (LG M50T: higher resistance; Molicel P45B: lower resistance), we extract an SOC-dependent instantaneous resistance $R_\Omega(\mathrm{SOC})$ from the first $\sim$50,ms pulse step and apply an IR correction to pOCV before fitting. In LG M50T, IR correction lifts the low-rate discharge pOCV by $+13$--$27$,mV with ageing; without it, PE-LAM is increasingly under-diagnosed (to $-8.80%$ relative error at late life) and LLI is suppressed (median $-3.07%$), with compensating inflation of apparent graphite loss. In P45B, on a branch-fair $3.0$--$4.2$,V window, end-of-life charge-branch DMA reports higher PE-LAM ($+3.42$,pp) and LLI ($+5.36$,pp), while the discharge branch recovers larger Si-LAM (discharge--charge difference to $+14.38$,pp). Raising the lower cutoff ($2.5$--$4.2 \rightarrow 3.0$--$4.2$,V) further under-reports Si-LAM by $13.61$,pp by removing the Si-sensitive low-voltage tail. We propose a practical protocol: correct only the instantaneous ohmic term, harmonize the voltage window, and base quantitative attribution on the discharge branch, treating anomalous/negative component LAMs on charge as allocation artefacts rather than recovery.</description>

      <title>Rapid reduction of nitrophenols using reusable magnetic \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient and cost-effective conversion of nitro compounds to amines is crucial for industrial processes and environmental remediation, highlighting the growing demand for earth-abundant metal-based catalysts. In this study, magnetic Ni--NiO nanostructures and their composites with two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (\textit{h}-BN) were synthesized via a simple and scalable combustion method. The structural, morphological, and compositional properties of the synthesized materials were systematically investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV--Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of both Ni--NiO and \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanostructures was evaluated using nitrophenol reduction as a model reaction. The \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to pristine Ni--NiO, highlighting the synergistic interaction between \textit{h}-BN and Ni--NiO nanoparticles. Notably, the magnetic nature of the Ni--NiO core enabled facile recovery of the catalyst using an external magnetic field, and the composite demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for up to six catalytic cycles with minimal loss of activity. The combination of high catalytic efficiency, magnetic separability, and structural stability positions the \textit{h}-BN/Ni--NiO nanocomposite as a promising candidate for green and sustainable catalytic applications, particularly in environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19778v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory, Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.</description>

      <title>Before We Inject: Assessing the Impact of Silica-Based Aerosols on Stratospheric Chemistry via a Kinetic Model Informed by Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a geoengineering strategy to mitigate global warming by increasing Earth's albedo. Silica-based materials, such as diamond-doped silica aerogels, have shown promising optical properties, but their impact on stratospheric chemistry, ozone one in particular, remains largely unknown. Here, we present first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the heterogeneous reaction between hydrogen chloride ($\mathrm{HCl}$) and chlorine nitrate ($\mathrm{ClONO_2}$), two main reservoirs of stratospheric chlorine and nitrogen species, on a dry, hydroxylated $\alpha$-quartz silica interface. Our results reveal a barrierless reaction pathway toward the formation of chlorine gas ($\mathrm{Cl}_2$), a major contributor to stratospheric ozone loss. We design a heterogeneous kinetic model informed by our MD simulation and available experimental data: despite the barrierless formation of $\mathrm{Cl_2}$, the higher surface affinities and partial pressures of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$ and $\mathrm{HCl}$ compared to those of $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ result in a negligible reaction probability, $\gamma_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$, upon chlorine nitrate collision with the silica surface. Since $\gamma_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ enters as a proportionality constant in the definition of the heterogeneous reaction rate, our kinetic model indicates that the injection of silica-based aerosols may have only a limited impact on stratospheric ozone depletion driven by $\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ chemistry. At the same time, our findings also underscore the scarcity of experimental data, the need of better theoretical frameworks for the inclusion of MD results into kinetic models, and the urgency for further experimental validations of silica-based SAI technologies before their deployment in climate intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Topological resolution of conical intersection seams and the coupled cluster bifurcation via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($\mu$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the K\"{o}hn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($\mu=1, \gamma=\pi$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)].</description>

Abstract: We outline the design and characterization of a laser pulse shaper, which creates an ``ultraslow optical centrifuge'' - a linearly polarized field whose polarization vector rotates with arbitrarily low angular acceleration. By directly recording this rotation in time with nonlinear cross-correlation, we demonstrate the tunability of such centrifuge (both in terms of its initial and its final rotational frequencies) in the range of accelerations which are three orders of magnitude lower than those available with a conventional centrifuge design. We showcase the functionality of the ultraslow centrifuge by spinning CS$_2$ molecules in a molecular jet. Utilizing the extremely low angular acceleration to control molecular rotation inside viscous media is a promising application for this unique optical tool.</description>

      <title>Onsager's Real Cavity model near solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an extended Onsager real-cavity framework to describe the Casimir-Polder interaction of small molecules dissolved in dielectric liquids near planar interfaces. By analytically resolving the geometry of the cavity opening, we derive a closed expression that arises when the molecule approaches a surface and connects them smoothly to the asymptotic medium-assisted interaction. Using experimentally established dielectric functions for water, propanol, and PTFE together with accurate molecular polarisabilities for O2 and N2, we compute the full distance-dependent potential for four molecule (O2 and N2)-liquid (water and propanol)-surface (PTFE) combinations. The results reveal how local-field screening inside the cavity, molecular polarisability, and liquid permittivity jointly determine the magnitude and shape of the interaction, including the characteristic transition from the open cavity (small separations) and closed cavity (large separations). The framework provides a transparent baseline for dispersion forces in liquids, while highlighting limitations associated with the point-dipole description, the absence of repulsive contributions, and the breakdown of the dipole approximation at ultrashort separations.</description>

      <title>First results of the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (T2ApIR) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum algorithms for excited-state quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic excited states are central to a vast array of physical and chemical phenomena, yet accurate and efficient methods for preparing them on quantum devices remain challenging and comparatively underexplored. We introduce a general dissipative algorithm for selectively preparing ab initio electronic excited states. The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these schemes through numerical simulations of atomic and molecular spectra, including valence excitations in prototypical planar conjugated molecules and transition-metal complexes. Taken together, these results provide a new pathway for advancing quantum simulation methods for realistic strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Time-domain measurement of Auger electron dynamics in xenon atoms after giant resonant photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved measurement of Auger-Meitner (AM) decay [Nature 419, 803 (2002)] marked a milestone in the development of attosecond science. To date, the time constants for the AM decay processes obtained from the time-domain experiments were found to be consistent with the values deduced from conventional energy-domain measurements. One of the main factors limiting the temporal resolution of these studies is the unlocked carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the laser pulses used to probe the electronic dynamics triggered by inner-shell photoabsorption. In this work, we report time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy of xenon and krypton using attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV in combination with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. We observed that the N$_{4,5}$OO Auger electrons from xenon exhibit a clear streaking pattern, but with an unexpected time shift of $\sim$ 1.32 fs relative to the 4$d$ photoelectrons. Furthermore, the energy-integrated yield of streaked Auger electrons from xenon exhibits a pronounced minimum at a pump-probe time delay of 4 fs. Neither of these observations can be explained by current streaking theories and both are inconsistent with lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. The M$_{4,5}$NN Auger electrons from krypton partly overlap in energy with the 3$d$ inner-shell photoelectrons and do not show these anomalous features. This study offers new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region, laying the groundwork for attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms.</description>

      <title>Fabrication, drug delivery kinetics and cell viability assay of PLGA-coated vancomycin-loaded silicate porous microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous ceramic microspheres are a desirable substance for bone tissue reconstruction and delivery applications. This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside &gt; akermanite &gt; bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite &gt; diopside &gt; bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 {\mu}m is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Long-Wavelength TDDFT Without Empty States: From Polarizability to Kubo Conductivity Across Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(\alpha_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than na\"ive ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end.
  The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital twins.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen bonding in water under extreme confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluids under extreme confinement exhibit unique structures and intermolecular bonding, distinct from their bulk analogs, driving innovative applications at the water-energy nexus. Probing confined water experimentally at the length scale of intermolecular and surface forces has, however, remained a challenge. Here, we report direct molecular-level observations of hydrogen bonding in water confined inside individual carbon nanotubes, enabled by in-situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. Hydrogen bonding is probed via the intramolecular O-H stretching frequency, which serves as a sensitive spectral signature of the local intermolecular bonding environment. Water in larger carbon nanotubes exhibit the bonded O-H vibrations of bulk water, but at smaller diameters, the frequency blueshifts to near the free O-H stretch found in water vapor and hydrophobic surfaces, indicating a highly dispersed, non-H-bonded environment. Theoretical analysis based on quantum vibrational oscillators indicates that enhanced damping rates, corresponding to rapid hydrogen-bond fluctuations, leads the bimodal spectral peaks to merge into a single broad feature, matching the experimental observation. Furthermore, cryogenic experiments provide insights into complex structural phase transitions of confined water. This research reveals the quantum and dynamic nature of hydrogen bonds under confinement and the potential impact of unveiling molecular-level structure and bonding in confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Theory of Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the photoelectron angular distributions produced by elliptical and cross-polarized two-color laser fields interacting with randomly oriented chiral molecules decompose into four irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group. One of these ($A_u$) corresponds to a non-dichroic enantiosensitive (NoDES) contribution. This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects. NoDES spectroscopy thus provides a symmetry-protected and phase-robust route to probe molecular chirality on the ultrafast time scale. The experimental confirmation of our theory is presented in the companion paper [L. Fede et al., arXiv:2512.19062 (2025)].</description>

Abstract: Linear surprisal analysis is applied to state-to-state experimental results for the H-atom abstraction reaction, H + HI -&gt; H2 + I. Contrary to previously reported results that indicated that the products from this reaction were not well fit by a linear surprisal, the reaction can be accurately described by linear surprisal parameters when kinematic energy constraints are taken into account. This is further evidence of the important role mass effects play in the energy disposal of state-to-state reactions and of the quantitative value of a very simple model to predict the maximum energy available to the internal states of the products.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Mediated Chirality Transfer from Organic Cation to Inorganic lattice in Hybrid Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid metal halide perovskites combine strong spin-orbit coupling, soft lattice dynamics and molecular tunability, making them promising platforms for chiral optoelectronics and spin dependent phenomena. While chiral organic spacers are known to induce optical activity, the microscopic mechanism by which molecular chirality couples to the inorganic lattice remains unclear. Here, we investigate coherent vibrational dynamics in the chiral perovskite ($R$-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$ and its racemic analogue using transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by Raman spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. We identify a coherent phonon at ~5.7 meV that couples strongly to excitons in the chiral material but is absent in the racemic counterpart. This mode is assigned to lattice vibrations involving coupled motion of the chiral spacer and Pb-I framework, including rotational displacement patterns. These results establish coherent lattice motion as a pathway for mediating chiral responses in hybrid materials.</description>
