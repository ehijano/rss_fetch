      <title>The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) Python library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis is a crucial methodology in astrophysics, enabling the interpretation of the integrated light of galaxies and stellar clusters. By combining empirical and/or theoretical libraries of the spectral energy distribution emitted by simple stellar populations (SSPs) with models of the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution, population synthesis facilitates the estimation of essential galaxy properties, such as total stellar mass, star formation rate, mass-weighted age and metallicity, etc. The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) is a Python library that offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for stellar population synthesis. Its main goal is to compute composite spectra using different galaxy evolution models and SSP libraries with ease and efficiency. It incorporates additional effects, such as cosmic redshift and dust extinction, and it computes several observable quantities derived from the spectra, including broadband photometric fluxes and equivalent widths.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Celestial Imaging: High Dynamic Range with Neuromorphic Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with limited dynamic range, leading to saturation and loss of detail when capturing scenes with significant brightness variations. Neuromorphic cameras, inspired by human retina, offer a solution by providing an inherently high dynamic range. This capability enables them to capture both bright and faint celestial objects without saturation effects, preserving details across a wide range of luminosities. This paper investigates the application of neuromorphic imaging technology for capturing celestial bodies across a wide range of flux levels. Its advantages are demonstrated through examples such as the bright planet Saturn with its faint moons and the bright star Sirius A alongside its faint companion, Sirius B.</description>

      <title>The Gaia AVU-GSR solver: a CPU + GPU parallel code toward Exascale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solver module of the Astrometric Verification Unit - Global Sphere Reconstruction (AVU-GSR) pipeline aims to find the astrometric parameters of $\sim$$10^8$ stars in the Milky Way, besides the attitude and instrumental settings of the Gaia satellite and the parametrized post Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ with a resolution of 10-100 micro-arcseconds. To perform this task, the code solves a system of linear equations with the iterative Least Squares (LSQR) algorithm, where the coefficient matrix is large (10-50 TB) and sparse and the iterations stop when convergence is reached in the least squares sense. The two matrix-by-vector products performed at each LSQR step were GPU-ported, firstly with OpenACC and then with CUDA, resulting in a $\sim$$1.5$x and $\sim$$14$x speedup, respectively, over an original code version entirely parallelized on the CPU with MPI + OpenMP. The CUDA code was further optimized and then ported with programming frameworks portable across different GPU architectures, obtaining a further $\sim$$2$x acceleration factor. One critical section of the code consists in the computation of covariances, whose total number is $N_{\rm unk} \times (N_{\rm unk} - 1)/2$ and occupy $\sim$1 EB, being $N_{\rm unk}$$\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ the total number of unknowns. This "Big Data" issue cannot be faced with standard approaches: we defined an I/O-based pipeline made of two concurrently launched jobs, where one job, i.e., the LSQR, writes the files and the second job reads them, iteratively computes the covariances and deletes them. The pipeline does not present significant bottlenecks until a number of covariances elements equal to $\sim$$8 \times 10^6$. The code currently runs in production on Leonardo CINECA infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Chorus: Optimizing Synchrotron Transfer Coefficients with Weighted Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate synchrotron transfer coefficients are essential for modeling radiation processes in astrophysics. However, their current calculation methods face significant challenges. Analytical approximations of the synchrotron emissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron distribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic plasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other hand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the transfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a weighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in the weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients, drawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging to approximate the $\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate median errors below $5\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times reduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical integrations. Validation against a single $\kappa$ distribution, as well as its extension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and versatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased errors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges with rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies. Addressing these issues could further enhance the method's reliability. Our method has the potential to provide a powerful tool for radiative transfer simulations, where synchrotron emission is the main radiative process.</description>

      <title>pastamarkers 2: pasta sauce colormaps for your flavorful results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the big data era of Astrophysics, the improvement of visualization techniques can greatly enhance the ability to identify and interpret key features in complex datasets. This aspect of data analysis will become even more relevant in the near future, with the expected growth of data volumes. With our studies, we aim to drive progress in this field and inspire further research. We present the second release of pastamarkers, a Python-based matplotlib package that we initially presented last year. In this new release we focus on big data visualization and update the content of our first release. We find that analyzing complex problems and mining large data sets becomes significantly more intuitive and engaging when using the familiar and appetizing colors of pasta sauces instead of traditional colormaps.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Imaging with Generative Models: Insights from a Two-Models Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have recently revolutionized image generation tasks across diverse domains, including galaxy image synthesis. This study investigates the statistical learning and consistency of three generative models: light-weight-gan (a GAN-based model), Glow (a Normalizing Flow-based model), and a diffusion model based on a U-Net denoiser, all trained on non-overlapping subsets of the SDSS dataset of 64x64 grayscale images. While all models produce visually realistic images with well-preserved morphological variable distributions, we focus on their ability to learn and generalize the underlying data distribution. The diffusion model shows a transition from memorization to generalization as the dataset size increases, confirming previous findings. Smaller datasets lead to overfitting, while larger datasets enable novel sample generation, supported by the denoising process's theoretical basis. For the flow-based model, we propose an "inversion test" leveraging its bijective nature. Similarly, the GAN-based model achieves comparable morphological consistency but lacks bijectivity. We then introduce a "discriminator test", which shows successful learning for larger datasets but poorer confidence with smaller ones. Across all models, dataset sizes below O(100,000) pose challenges to learning. Along our experiments, the "two-models" framework enables robust evaluations, highlighting both the potential and limitations of these models. These findings provide valuable insights into statistical learning in generative modeling, with applications certainly extending beyond galaxy image generation.</description>

      <title>Test and Calibration of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the AdityaL1 mission observes the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This paper presents the results of various on ground and on board tests and their comparison with the specifications. Moreover, we also present the scheme for data calibration. We demonstrate that the test results are compliant with the specified figures, except the spatial resolution. Such discrepancy will limit the photometric measurements only, at a scale of 2.2" instead of 1.4" as originally envisioned. The results obtained here show that SUIT observations open up a new window for solar observations.</description>

      <title>The Problem of the Global Astrometric Sphere Reconstruction in Astrometry -- Issues and Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we give a brief account of the problem of the Global Astrometric Sphere Reconstruction in Astrometry, with particular reference to the Gaia and Gaia-like astrometric missions, namely those adopting a scanning strategy with observations in TDI mode. We sketch the design of the Gaia mission, the mathematical modelling that comes naturally from its observing strategy, and how the problem of the global sphere reconstruction translates into that of the solution of large, sparse, and overdetermined system of linearized equations. After a short description of the two approaches to this problem implemented in the Gaia data reduction pipelines, we list the main known problems of the current approaches, with specific reference to the calibration and the correlation issues. Finally, we suggest how an arc-based solution could help to alleviate some of these problems, how it would be possible to devise a mathematical model for such an observable despite the TDI observing mode, and the main difficulty that a parallel implementation of this model would have to solve.</description>

      <title>Evaluating small vision-language models as AI assistants for radio astronomical source analysis tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23859v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio telescopes is set to transform radio astronomy by producing massive data volumes that challenge traditional processing methods. Deep learning techniques have shown strong potential in automating radio analysis tasks, yet are often constrained by the limited availability of large annotated datasets. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has led to foundational radio vision models, but adapting them for new tasks typically requires coding expertise, limiting their accessibility to a broader astronomical community. Text-based AI interfaces offer a promising alternative by enabling task-specific queries and example-driven learning. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable zero-shot capabilities, are increasingly used in scientific domains. However, deploying large-scale models remains resource-intensive, and there is a growing demand for AI systems that can reason over both visual and textual data in astronomical analysis. This study explores small-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as AI assistants for radio astronomy, combining LLM capabilities with vision transformers. We fine-tuned the LLaVA VLM on a dataset of 59k radio images from multiple surveys, enriched with 38k image-caption pairs from the literature. The fine-tuned models show clear improvements over base models in radio-specific tasks, achieving ~30% F1-score gains in extended source detection, but they underperform pure vision models and exhibit ~20% drop on general multimodal tasks. Inclusion of caption data and LoRA fine-tuning enhances instruction-following and helps recover ~10% accuracy on standard benchmarks. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in radio VLMs, highlighting their potential and limitations, such as the need for better multimodal alignment, higher-quality datasets, and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>From Local to Remote: VisIVO Visual Analytics in the Era of the Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of astrophysics is continuously advancing, with an ever-growing influx of data requiring robust and efficient analysis tools. As the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescopes come fully operational, we anticipate the generation of hundreds of petabytes of data annually, characterized by unprecedented resolution and detail. In this context, scientific visualization becomes a critical component, enabling researchers to interpret complex datasets and extract meaningful insights. The immense volume of data demands not only suitable tools but also substantial infrastructure and computational capacity to analyze it effectively. In this work, we will discuss how we are addressing these challenges with the development of our interactive visualization tool named VisIVO Visual Analytics. The tool is transitioning from a local visualizer to a remote visualizer, utilizing a client-server architecture. This evolution will allow the software to run parallel visualization pipelines on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, thereby enhancing its capacity to handle extensive datasets efficiently.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major advancements in space science and detector technology brought about a revolution in global astrometry, the science of measuring distances and motions of stars in the Milky Way and in the local universe. From the first ESA astrometric mission HIPPARCOS of the early 80s to the current Gaia mission, the data volume and computational complexity of the full reduction process has increased by several orders of magnitude, requiring high-performance computing and data throughput. We review the principles and computational complexity of general global astrometric models that lead to the statistical treatment of an extra-large, highly non-linear estimation problem. Some numerical aspects of inspecting Gaia's proper motions to find cosmological signals at all scales are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: In an effort to reduce drain on grant funds and decrease unused space in publications, we have developed a Python package for inserting advertisements into the space left empty by corner plots. This novel technique can allow authors to reduce or eliminate publication charges for journals such as MNRAS and ApJ. In order to offset publication costs entirely, we recommend that authors include anywhere from 200-700 corner plots per paper, with the exact number depending on the journal used. Finally, we discuss other opportunities to generate ad revenue through publications.</description>

      <title>Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with the Photonic Lantern Nuller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets within a single beam-width from its host star. The PLN leverages the spatial symmetry of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to create nulled ports, which cancel out on-axis starlight but allow off-axis exoplanet light to couple. The null-depths are limited by wavefront aberrations in the system as well as by imperfections in the lantern. We show that the implicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar coupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority of the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher sensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff we observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some ports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead to deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports at once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port and discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for science observations.</description>

      <title>Infant Core-collapse Supernovae with Circumstellar Interactions from KMTNet I: Luminous Transitional Case of KSP-SN-2022c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $BVi$ multi-band high-cadence observations of a Type II supernova (SN) KSP-SN-2022c from a star-forming galaxy at $z$ $\simeq$ 0.041 from its infant to nebular phase. Early light curve fitting with a single power-law is consistent with the first detection of roughly 15 minutes after shock breakout. The SN light curves feature a rapid rise and decline across its luminous ($V$ $\simeq$ -18.41 mag) peak together with a short plateau. The presence of the short plateau and rapid post-peak decline place the SN within a small group of transitional type between Type II-P and II-L subtypes. Its (i) broad and asymmetric H profiles with large emission-to-absorption ratios and (ii) near-peak luminosity in excess of predictions from SN shock cooling models both point to circumstellar interactions in this SN. Early colour evolution exhibits a short-lived blueward motion in $B-V$ within the first few days and continuous reddening in $V-i$, inconsistent with simple blackbody heating. Our simulations of SN light curves estimate 13 $M_\odot$ and 680 $R_\odot$ for the mass and radius of the progenitor, respectively, together with CSM of 0.73 $M_\odot$ to account for the excess luminosity and rapid post-peak declines. We discuss the origin of its short plateau and early colour evolution in the context of partial envelope stripping of the progenitor star and a delayed SN shock breakout near the edge of the CSM, respectively, as indicated by our simulations. We establish a correlation between post-peak decline rates and CSM mass in Type II SNe, highlighting that CSM interactions play a major role in shaping the post-peak evolution of transitional types.</description>

      <title>Astronomers Getting Less Creative Over Time Is Why This Title Isn't Better</title>

Abstract: For generations, people have complained that things used to be better in the past. In this paper, we investigate this change by specifically looking at creativity in astronomy. To do this,we explore if older constellations reflected a greater sense of creativity on the part of those designing them than more modern constellations do. We find that things really have become simplistic and less original over time.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirements for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observations -- IV. Bias and variance with time and frequency correlated residual gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observation of multifrequency angular power spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the neutral hydrogen holds the key to understand the structure formation and its evolution during the reionization and post-reionization era. A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen arises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of interest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed through various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect arises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency dependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass error in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an analytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass errors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for detection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\sim 8$ with the upcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of angular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the redshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with residual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these estimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a part of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass errors and their relative effects are discussed. We find, with assumed models of gain and bandpass errors, signal detection is possible at this redshift with $128$ hours of observations. However, to achieve this one needs to have better calibration accuracy than present day interferometers.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_\mathrm{E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract the light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_\mathrm{E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>A Swift analysis of the Eras tour set list and implications for astrophysics research (Taylor's version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects. However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles, enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models (DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</description>

      <title>The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After decades of dismissal and secrecy, it has become clear that a significant number of the world's governments take Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), seriously -- yet still seem to know little about them. As a result, these phenomena are increasingly attracting the attention of scientists around the world, some of whom have recently formed research efforts to monitor and scientifically study UAP. In this paper, we review and summarize approximately 20 historical government studies dating from 1933 to the present (in Scandinavia, WWII, US, Canada, France, Russia, China), several historical private research studies (France, UK, US), and both recent and current scientific research efforts (Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US). In doing so, our objective is to clarify the existing global and historical scientific narrative around UAP. Studies range from field station development and deployment to the collection and analysis of witness reports from around the world. We dispel the common misconception that UAPs are an American phenomenon and show that UAP can be, and have been, scientifically investigated. Our aim here is to enable future studies to draw on the great depth of prior documented experience.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimisation of a Sub-Terahertz Spaceborne VLBI Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the finest angular resolution of all astronomical observation techniques. However, observations with Earth-based instruments are approaching fundamental limits on angular resolution. These can only be overcome by placing at least one interferometric element in space. In this paper, several concepts of spaceborne VLBI systems are discussed, including TeraHertz Exploration and Zooming-in for Astrophysics (THEZA) and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX). Spaceborne VLBI telescopes have some of the most demanding requirements of any space science mission. The VLBI system as a whole includes globally distributed elements, each with their own functional constraints, limiting when observations can be performed. This necessitates optimisation of the system parameters in order to maximise the scientific return of the mission. Presented is an investigation into how the impact of the functional constraints of a spaceborne VLBI telescope affect the overall system performance. A preliminary analysis of how these constraints can be minimised through optimisation of the spacecraft configuration and operation is also provided. A space-based VLBI simulation tool (spacevlbi) has been developed to model such missions and its capabilities are demonstrated throughout the paper. It is imperative that the functional constraints are considered early in the design of the future space-based VLBI systems in order to generate feasible mission concepts and to identify the key technology developments required to mitigate these limitations.</description>

      <title>Modelling variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.</description>

      <title>Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</description>

Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>
