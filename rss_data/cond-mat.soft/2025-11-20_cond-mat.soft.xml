      <title>Rheology of dense vibrated granular flows: non-monotonic response controlled by granular temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rheology of dense granular materials subjected to vertical vibration using numerical simulations of a stress-imposed vane rheometer. The effective viscosity increases with confining pressure, decreases with vibration amplitude, and exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on frequency: weakening is observed at intermediate frequencies but is lost at high frequencies. We show that the rheological response is governed by the balance between grain-scale agitation energy and the stabilizing effect of confinement. This framework reconciles previously observed trends in viscosity and friction weakening and emphasizes the central role of energy injection and dissipation in determining granular flow properties under vibration.</description>

      <title>Particle deformability stabilizes hexatic order and suppresses crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional systems of deformable particles undergo a continuous liquid-hexatic transition upon compression or cooling, but no hexatic-solid transition-even at zero temperature and high density. Numerical simulations reveal that solid-like configurations do not possess a lower energy than hexatic ones, so that at low temperatures the hexatic phase is thermodynamically favored due to its higher entropy. Dislocation condensation, necessary for solid formation, is suppressed as the system accommodates strain via particle shape changes, responding affinely to compression. Our findings identify a generic route by which microscopic mechanical properties control defect energetics and reshape phase behavior in two dimensions, with broad relevance for soft and biological materials such as microgels and epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Shaping the aggregates of discotic particles with directional pair interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation processes in systems of planar macromolecules and colloids drive a broad range of phenomena in natural systems and soft materials. Depending on chemical architecture, intermolecular interactions in these systems may favor different relative pair orientations, such as stacking face-face or percolating edge-edge arrangements. In this work, we employ a versatile coarse-grained interaction model for disk-like particles to provide a general framework to rationalize the thermotropic formation of aggregates and predict the topology of the resulting suprastructures. Monte Carlo and Brownian Dynamics simulations show that, with an appropriate tuning of the interactions, discotics spontaneously nucleate into clusters with globular, planar or stacked geometries, leading to materials with specific internal order and associated physicochemical properties.</description>

      <title>A thermo-mechanically coupled finite deformation model for freezing-induced damage in soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the U.S., approximately 17 patients die each day awaiting an organ transplant, a crisis driven by the inability to store organs long-term via methods like cryopreservation. A primary failure mechanism is the severe thermo-mechanical damage tissues experience during freezing. A predictive understanding of this damage is hindered by the complex interplay between heat transfer, phase change, and large deformation mechanics. Motivated by this fundamental problem, we present a fully coupled, thermo-mechanical phase-field framework for modeling damage evolution in fluid-saturated soft materials under cryogenic conditions. The theoretical framework integrates heat transfer with solid-liquid phase transition, finite deformation nonlinear elasticity, and progressive mechanical damage. The governing equations are solved using \texttt{FEniCS} finite element package. The presentation will detail the theoretical framework and showcase representative simulations that capture the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature, freezing phase field, stress, and damage fields during representative freezing protocols. The developed framework serves as a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of freezing-induced injury and for designing improved cryopreservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Spin-quenching in molecule-transition-metal-dichalcogenide heterostructure through inverse proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.</description>

      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>

      <title>Topological flowscape reveals state transitions in nonreciprocal living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations reveal internal tension in native state collagen fibrils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.</description>

      <title>Cell Shape Emerges from Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different fixed $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle after it is suddenly released from a harmonic trap moving with constant velocity through a fluctuating correlated medium, described by a scalar Gaussian field with relaxational dynamics and in contact with a thermal bath. We show that, after the release, the particle exhibits recoil, i.e., it moves in the direction opposite to the drag. As expected, this effect vanishes if the field equilibrates instantaneously. The final value of the average position of the particle is reached algebraically in time in the case of conserved dynamics of the field or for non-conserved dynamics at the critical point. Our predictions are expected to be relevant, at least qualitatively, to driven colloidal particles in liquid media close to critical points.</description>

      <title>Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Rotational Jamming of Plasmonic Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</description>
