      <title>Gene-environment interplay and public policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We posit that gene-environment interplay (GxE) studies should be developed both theoretically and empirically to be of relevance to policy makers. On the theoretical front, this development is essential because the current literature lacks the integration of a clear framework capturing the various goals of public policies. Empirically, GxE models need to be further developed because the common way of modelling GxE effects fails to adequately capture the heterogeneous effects public policies may have along the distribution of genetic propensities (as captured by polygenic indices). We fill these gaps by proposing a policy classification for GxE research and by offering guidance on advancing the empirical modelling of policy-informative GxE interplay. While doing so, we provide a systematic review of existing GxE studies on educational outcomes exploiting policy reforms or environments that could be targeted by public policy.</description>

      <title>F-BIAS: Towards a distributed national core facility for Bioimage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss in this article the creation and organization of a national core facility for bioimage analysis, based on a distributed team. F-BIAS federates bioimage analysts across France and relies on them to deliver services to the researchers of this territory. The main challenge in implementing this structure is to provide significant scientific value to its members, thereby encouraging their active participation and persuading their respective host teams to support their involvement. F-BIAS accomplished this by creating a professional network that mitigates the negative effects of isolation experienced by its members, who are often the sole bioimage analyst within their local teams, and fosters the development of their technical skills. In a second phase we capitalized on F-BIAS to create a virtual, remotely-operating core facility for bioimage analysis, offering consultations and collaborative project services to the scientific community of France. The services are organized so that they also contribute to the technical proficiency of the analysts. To promote the creation of similar structures, we present and discuss here the organization of this nationally distributed bioimage analysis service core, highlighting successes and challenges.</description>
