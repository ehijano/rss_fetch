      <title>Maximum augmented Zagreb index on polyomino chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a dynamic programming approach for identifying extremal polyomino chains with respect to degree-based topological indices. This approach provides an explicit recurrence and constructive algorithm that enables both the computation of an extremal polyomino chain in linear time with respect to its number of squares, and the enumeration of all maximal configurations in linear time with respect to their amount. As a main application, we resolve a problem posed in 2016 by characterizing the polyomino chains that maximize the Augmented Zagreb Index ($AZI$) for any fixed number of squares. The $AZI$, a degree-based index known for its strong chemical applicability in numerous studies, attains its maximum on two specific families of polyomino chains depending on the parity of their number of squares. We also derive closed-form expressions for the maximum $AZI$ and determine the exact number of extremal configurations. The results presented in this paper are aligned with previous contributions, and establish a constructive methodology for solving extremal problems in chemical graph theory, for which we provide a link to the code in the last section.</description>

      <title>A generalised Ramsey--Tur\'an problem for matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalised Ramsey--Tur\'an theorem for matchings, which (a) simultaneously generalises the Cockayne--Lorimer Theorem (Ramsey for matchings) and the Erd\H{o}s--Gallai Theorem (Tur\'an for matchings), and (b) is a generalised Tur\'an theorem in the sense that we can optimise the count of any clique (Tur\'an-type theorems optimise the count of edges). More precisely, for integers $q \ge 1$, $n \ge \ell \ge 2$, and $t_1,\dots,t_q \ge 1$ we determine the maximum number of $\ell$-vertex complete subgraphs in an $n$-vertex graph that admits a $q$-edge-colouring in which, for each $j=1,\dots,q$, the $j$-coloured subgraph has no matching of size $t_j$. We achieve this by identifying two explicit constructions and applying a compression argument to show that one of them achieves the maximum. Our compression algorithm is quite intricate and introduces methods that have not previously been applied to these types of problems: it employs an optimisation problem defined by the Gallai--Edmonds decompositions of each colour.</description>

      <title>On the Squared Distance Matrix of a Starlike Block Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.</description>

      <title>2-Distance Coloring of Planar Graphs with Maximum Degree at Least 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A k-distance r-coloring of a graph is a coloring of the vertices of the graph such that if the distance between 2 vertices x and y is less or equal to k, then x and y must have distinct colors. A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn with no edge crossing. We will study the 2-distance coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree at least 6.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Chow ring of a matroid satisfies the Hard Lefschetz property and Hodge Riemann relations. We provide a proof of this theorem by decomposition of the deletion operation into star subdivisions at two dimensional cones. This gives a simple combinatorial proof which avoids intersection cohomology or algebraic geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Sivaraman conjectured that every $P_k$-free graph has cop number at most $k-3$. In the same year, Liu proved this conjecture for $(P_k,\text{claw})$-free graphs. Recently Chudnovsky, Norin, Seymour, and Turcotte proved this conjecture for $P_5$-free graphs. For $k\geq 6$ the conjecture remains widely opened. Let the $E$ graph be the $\text{claw}$ with two subdivided edges. We show that all $(P_k,E)$-free graphs have cop number at most $\lceil \frac{k-1}{2} \rceil +3$, which improves and generalizes Liu's result for $(P_k,\text{claw})$-free graphs. We also prove that if $G$ is a graph whose longest path is length $p$, then $G$ has cop number at most $\lceil \frac{2p}{3} \rceil+3$. This improves a bound of Joret, Kami\'nski, and Theis. Our proof relies on demonstrating that all $(P_k,\text{claw},\text{butterfly},C_4,C_5)$-free graphs have cop number at most $\lceil\frac{k-1}{3}\rceil +3$.</description>

      <title>On Legendre Cordial Labeling of Some Graphs Under Graph Opearations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple connected graph $G$ of order $n$, a bijective function $f:V(G)\to\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ is said to be a Legendre cordial labeling modulo $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime, if the induced function $f_p^*:E(G)\to \{0,1\}$, defined by $f_p^*(uv)=0$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=-1$ or $f(u)+f(v)\equiv 0(\text{mod }p)$, and $f_p^*(uv)=1$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=1$, satisfies the condition $|e_{f_p^*}(0)-e_{f_p^*}(1)|\leq 1$ where $e_{f_p^*}(i)$ is the number of edges with label $i$ ($i=0,1$). This paper investigates the Legendre cordial labeling of graphs obtained through various operations: join, corona, lexicographic product, cartesian product, tensor product, and strong product.</description>

      <title>Applying Hurlbert's Linear Optimization Technique to Establish Bounds on Pebbling Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Hurlbert's Linear Optimization Technique to determine bounds on pebbling numbers. By applying Hurlbert's weight functions and optimization methods, we derive upper bounds for specific graph families. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of these bounds and contributes to a broader understanding of pebbling numbers in graph theory. In particular, the weight function lemma is applied to calculate upper bounds for graphs such as the Petersen graph, the Bruhat graph, and various trees.</description>

      <title>New examples of words for which the binomial complexities and the subword complexity coincide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of an infinite word can be measured in several ways, the two most common measures being the subword complexity and the abelian complexity. In 2015, Rigo and Salimov introduced a family of intermediate complexities indexed by $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$: the $k$-binomial complexities. These complexities scale up from the abelian complexity, with which the $1$-binomial complexity coincides, to the subword complexity, to which they converge pointwise as $k$ tends to $\infty$. In this article, we provide four classes of $d$-ary infinite words -- namely, $d$-ary $1$-balanced words, words with subword complexity $n\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}\mapsto n+(d-1)$ (which form a subclass of quasi-Sturmian words), hypercubic billiard words, and words obtained by coloring a Sturmian word with another Sturmian word -- for which this scale ``collapses'', that is, for which all $k$-binomial complexities, for $k\geq 2$, coincide with the subword complexity. This work generalizes a result of Rigo and Salimov, established in their seminal 2015 paper, which asserts that the $k$-binomial complexity of any Sturmian word coincides with its subword complexity whenever $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Log-Concavity and Log-Convexity of Restricted Infinite Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a classification on the sign distribution of $\Delta _{E,\ell}(n):= p_{E,\ell }(n)^2 - p_{E,\ell }(n-1) \, p_{E,\ell }(n+1)$, where \begin{equation*} \sum_{n =0}^{\infty} p_{E,\ell }(n) \, q^n := \prod_{n \in S}
  \left(1 - q^n \right)^{-f_{\ell}(n)},\quad (\ell \in \mathbb{N}, f_1\equiv 1). \end{equation*} We take the product over $1\in S \subset \mathbb{N}$ and denote the complement by $E$, the set of exceptions. In the case of $\ell=1$ and $E$ the multiples of $k$, $p_{E,1}\left( n\right) $ represents the number of $k$-regular partitions. More generally, let $f_{\ell}$ satisfy a certain growth condition. We determine the signs of $\Delta _{E,\ell }(n)$ for $\ell$ large. The signs mainly depend on the occurrence of subsets of $\{2,3,4,5\}$ as a part of the exception set and the residue class of $n$ modulo $ r$, where $r $ depends on $E$. For example, let $2,3 \in S$ and $4$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) &gt;0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} If we assume $3,4 \in S$ and $2$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) &lt; 0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} Note that this property is independent of the integers $k\in S,k&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Tight complexity bounds for diagram commutativity verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diagram $\mathcal{D} = (G, l)$ over a monoid $M$ is an oriented graph $G = (V, E)$ endowed with a labeling $l\colon E \to M$. A diagram is commutative if and only if for any two oriented paths with the same endpoints, the products in $M$ of their edge labels coincide. We propose the first asymptotically optimal algorithm for diagram commutativity verification applicable to all graph families. For graphs with $\lvert V\rvert \preceq \lvert E\rvert \preceq \lvert V\rvert^2$, which covers most practically relevant cases, our algorithm runs in $$ O\bigl(|V|\,|E|\bigr) \cdot \bigl(T_{\mathrm{equal}} + T_{\mathrm{multi}}\bigr) $$ time; here $T_{\mathrm{equal}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{multi}}$ denote the times to perform an equality check and a multiplication in $M$, respectively. We also establish new lower bounds on the numbers of equality checks and multiplications necessary for commutativity verification, which asymptotically match our algorithm's cost and thus prove its tightness.</description>

      <title>$k$-Fair Coalitions in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple graph. A subset $S \subseteq V$ is called a $k$-fair dominating set if every vertex not in $S$ has exactly $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A, B \subseteq V$ form a $k$-fair coalition of $G$ if neither $A$ nor $B$ is a $k$-fair dominating set and the union $A \cup B$ is a $k$-fair dominating set of $G$. A partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_m\}$ of $V$ is called a $k$-fair coalition partition, if every set $V_i\in\pi$, either $V_i$ is a $k$-fair dominating set with exactly $k$ vertices, or $V_i$ is not a $k$-fair dominating set, but forms a $k$-fair coalition with some other set $V_j$ in $\pi$. The $k$-fair coalition number $C_{kf}(G)$ is the largest possible size of a $k$-fair coalition partition for $G$. The objective of this study is to initiate an examination into the notion of $k$-fair coalitions in graphs and present essential findings.</description>

      <title>Nordhaus--Gaddum type bounds for the complement rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex simple graph with adjacency matrix $A_G$. The complement rank of $G$ is defined as $\operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. In this paper we study Nordhaus--Gaddum type bounds for the complement rank. We prove that for every graph $G$, $$ \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)\cdot\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \ge n, \qquad \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)+\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \ge n+1, $$ with the equality cases characterized. We further obtain strengthened multiplicative lower bounds under additional structural assumptions. Finally, we show that the trivial upper bounds $$ \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)\cdot\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \le n^2, \qquad \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)+\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \le 2n $$ are tight by explicitly constructing, for every $n\ge 4$, graphs $G$ with $\operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)=\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I)=n$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem (Annals of Mathematics, 2015) for the Kadison-Singer conjecture implies the following result in spectral graph theory: For any undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a maximum edge effective resistance at most $\alpha$, there exists a partition of its edge set $E$ into $E_1 \cup E_2$ such that the two edge-induced subgraphs of $G$ spectrally approximates $(1/2)G$ with a relative error $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$. However, the proof of this theorem is non-constructive. It remains an open question whether such a partition can be found in polynomial time, even for special classes of graphs.
  In this paper, we explore polynomial-time algorithms for partitioning circulant graphs via partitioning their generators. We develop an efficient algorithm that partitions a circulant graph whose generators form an arithmetic progression, with an error matching that in the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem and optimal, up to a constant. On the other hand, we prove that if the generators of a circulant graph are ``far" from an arithmetic progression, no partition of the generators can yield two circulant subgraphs with an error matching that in the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem.
  In addition, we extend our algorithm to Cayley graphs whose generators are from a product of multiple arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Cycle systems, coparking functions, and h-vectors of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The h-vector of a matroid M is an important invariant related to the independence complex of M and can also be recovered from an evaluation of its Tutte polynomial. A well-known conjecture of Stanley posits that the h-vector of a matroid is a pure O-sequence, meaning that it can be obtained by counting faces of a pure multicomplex. Merino has established Stanley's conjecture for the case of cographic matroids via chip-firing on graphs and the concept of a G-parking function. Inspired by these constructions, we introduce the notion of a cycle system for a matroid M -- a family of cycles (unions of circuits) of M with overlap properties that mimic cut-sets in a graph. A choice of cycle system on M defines a collection of integer sequences that we call coparking functions. We show that for any cycle system on M, the set of coparking functions is in bijection with the set of bases of M. We show that maximal coparking functions all have the same degree, and that cycle systems behave well under deletion and contraction. This leads to a proof of Stanley's conjecture for the case of matroids that admit cycle systems, which include, for instance, graphic matroids of cones as well as K33-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Ryser's Theorem for Simple Multi-Latin Rectangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general result on completing objects similar to Latin rectangles in which the number of occurrences of each symbol is prescribed, each cell contains multiple symbols, and no cell contains repeated symbols. This generalizes several results in the literature, and leads to confirming a conjecture of Cavenagh, H\"{a}m\"{a}l\"{a}inen, Lefevre, and Stones.
  An $r\times s$ {\it $\lambda$-Latin rectangle} $L$ is an $r\times s$ array in which each cell contains a multiset of $\lambda$ elements from the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$ of symbols such that each symbol occurs at most $\lambda$ times in each row and column. If $r=s=n$, then $L$ is a {\it $\lambda$-Latin square}. A $\lambda$-Latin rectangle is {\it simple} if no symbol is repeated in any cell. Cavenagh et al. asked for conditions that ensure a simple $\lambda$-Latin rectangle can be extended to a simple $\lambda$-Latin square. We solve this problem in a more general setting by allowing the number of occurrences of each symbol to be prescribed. Cavenagh et al. conjectured that for each $r, \lambda$ there exists some $n(r, \lambda)$ such that for any $n \geq n(r, \lambda)$, every simple partial $\lambda$-Latin square of order $r$ (each cell contain at most $\lambda$ symbols) embeds in a simple $\lambda$-Latin square of order $n$. We confirm this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Restricted Jacobi permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi permutations, introduced by Viennot in the context of Jacobi elliptic functions, are counted by the Euler numbers $E_{n}$ appearing in the series expansion $\sec x+\tan x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}E_{n}x^{n}/n!$. We conduct a systematic study of pattern avoidance in Jacobi permutations, achieving a complete enumeration of Jacobi permutations avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. In the case of a single pattern restriction, we obtain refined enumerations with respect to several permutation statistics: the number of ascents (or descents), the number of left-to-right minima, and the last letter. Bijections involving certain subfamilies of binary trees and Dyck paths, as well as generating function techniques, play important roles in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Permutahedron Triangulations via Total Linear Stability and the Dual Braid Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each finite Coxeter group $W$ and each standard Coxeter element of $W$, we construct a triangulation of the $W$-permutahedron. For particular realizations of the $W$-permutahedron, we show that this is a regular triangulation induced by a height function coming from the theory of total linear stability for Dynkin quivers. We also explore several notable combinatorial properties of these triangulations that relate the Bruhat order, the noncrossing partition lattice, and Cambrian congruences. Each triangulation gives an explicit mechanism for relating two different presentations of the corresponding braid group (the standard Artin presentation and Bessis's dual presentation). This is a step toward uniformly proving conjectural simple, explicit, and type-uniform presentations for the corresponding pure braid group.</description>

      <title>Balancing Extensions in Posets of Large Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit classic balancing problems for linear extensions of a partially ordered set $P$, proving results that go far beyond many of the best earlier results on this topic. For example, with $p(x\prec y)$ the probability that $x$ precedes $y$ in a uniform linear extension, $\delta_{xy} = \min\{p(x \prec y), p(y \prec x)\}$, and $\delta(P)=\max \delta_{xy}$, we show that $\delta(P)$ tends to $1/2$ as $n := |P| \to\infty$ if $P$ has width $\Omega(n)$ or $\omega(\log(n))$ minimal elements, and is at least $1/e-o(1)$ if $P$ has width $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ or height $o(n)$.
  Motivated by both consequences for balance problems and intrinsic interest, we also consider several old and new parameters associated with $P$. Here, in addition to balance, we study relations between the parameters and suggest various questions that are thought to be worthy of further investigation.</description>

      <title>Falconer's problem for dot product on paraboloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish dimensional thresholds for dot product sets associated with compact subsets of translated paraboloids. Specifically, we prove that when the dimension of such a subset exceeds $ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $ \frac{d}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8d - 4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 4$, its dot product set has positive Lebesgue measure.
  This result demonstrates that if a compact set in $ \mathbb{R}^d $ exhibits a paraboloidal structure, then the usual dimensional barrier of $ \frac{d}{2} $ for dot product sets can be lowered for $ d \geq 3 $. Our work serves as the continuous counterpart of a paper by Che-Jui Chang, Ali Mohammadi, Thang Pham, and Chun-Yen Shen, which examines the finite field setting with partial reliance on the extension conjecture.
  The key idea, closely following their paper, is to reformulate the dot product set on the paraboloid as a variant of a distance set. This reformulation allows us to leverage state-of-the-art results from the pinned distance problem, as established by Larry Guth, Alex Iosevich, Yumeng Ou, and Hong Wang for $ d = 2 $, and by Xiumin Du, Yumeng Ou, Kevin Ren, and Ruixiang Zhang for higher dimensions. Finally, we present explicit constructions and existence proofs that highlight the sharpness of our results.</description>

      <title>Liar's vertex-edge domination in unit disk graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph. A closed neighbourhood of an edge $e=uv$ between two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, denoted by $N_G[e]$, is the set of vertices in the neighbourhood of $u$ and $v$ including $\{u,v\}$. A subset $L$ of $V$ is said to be liar's vertex-edge dominating set if $(i)$ for every edge $e\in E$, $|N_G[e]\cap L|\geq 2$ and $(ii)$ for every pair of distinct edges $e,e'$, $|(N_G[e]\cup N_G[e'])\cap L|\geq 3$. The minimum liar's vertex-edge domination problem is to find the liar's vertex-edge dominating set of minimum cardinality. In this article, we show that the liar's vertex-edge domination problem is NP-complete in unit disk graphs, and we design a polynomial time approximation scheme(PTAS) for the minimum liar's vertex-edge domination problem in unit disk graphs.</description>

      <title>All-$k$-Isolation in Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an all-$k$-isolating set of a graph to be a set $S$ of vertices such that, if one removes $S$ and all its neighbors, then no component in what remains has order $k$ or more. The case $k=1$ corresponds to a dominating set and the case $k=2$ corresponds to what Caro and Hansberg called an isolating set. We show that every tree of order $n \neq k$ contains an all-$k$-isolating set $S$ of size at most $n/(k+1)$, and moreover, the set $S$ can be chosen to be an independent set. This extends previous bounds on variations of isolation, while improving a result of Luttrell et al., who called the associated parameter the $k$-neighbor component order connectivity. We also characterize the trees where this bound is achieved. Further, we show that for~$k\le 5$, apart from one exception every tree with $n\neq k$ contains $k+1$ disjoint independent all-$k$-isolating sets.</description>

      <title>Homology character of the parabolic coset poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the analogy with the Coxeter complex on one side, and parking functions on the other side, we study the poset of parabolic cosets in a finite Coxeter group. We show that this poset is Cohen-Macaulay, and get an explicit formula for the character of its (unique) nonzero homology group in terms of the M\"obius function of the intersection lattice. This homology character becomes a positive element of the parabolic Burnside ring (in its natural basis) after tensoring with the sign character. The coefficients of this character essentially encode the colored $h$-vector of the positive chamber complex (following Bastidas, Hohlweg, and Saliola, this complex is defined by taking Weyl chambers that lie on the positive side of a generic hyperplane). Roughly speaking, tensoring by the sign character on one side corresponds to the transformation going from the $f$-vector to the $h$-vector on the other side.</description>

      <title>A characterization of locally ordered ternary relations in terms of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1917, Huntington and Kline, followed by Huntington in 1924, studied systems of axioms for ternary relations aiming to capture the concepts of linear order (called betwenness) and cycle order, respectively. Among many other properties, they proved there are several independent set of axioms defining either linear order or cycle order. In this work, we consider systems arising from the four common axioms of linear order and cycle order, together with a new axiom F, stating that if a tuple abc is in the relation, then either cba or bca is in the relation as well. Although, at first glace this allows for a much richer type of systems, we prove that these are either of linear order or cycle order type. Our main result is a complete characterization of the finite systems satisfying the set of axioms {B, C, D, F, 2}, where B, C, D and 2 are axioms presented by Huntington. Unlike what happens in the previous situation, with this modification we obtain a larger family of systems which we characterize in terms of digraphs.</description>

      <title>The List-distinguishing chromatic number of graphs containing only small complete bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2006, Collins and Trenk obtained a general sharp upper bound for the distinguishing chromatic number of a connected graph. Inspired by Catlin's combinatorial techniques from 1978, we establish improved upper bounds for classes of connected graphs that have only small complete bigraphs as induced subgraphs. In this framework, we also consider the list-distinguishing chromatic number of such graphs.
  We apply Menger's theorem to demonstrate applications of our main result for graphs whose constructions are based on Paley graphs, Cayley graphs on Dihedral groups, and circulant Cayley graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring with identity. The clean graph $Cl(R)$ of a ring $R$ is a graph whose vertices are pairs $(e, u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of $R$. Two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and $(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe = 0$ or $uv = vu = 1$. The graph $Cl_2(R)$ is the induced subgraph of $Cl(R)$ induced by the set $\{(e, u): e \text{ is a nonzero idempotent and } u \text{ is a unit of } R\}$. In this study, we present properties that arise from the isomorphism of two clean graphs and conditions under which two clean graphs over direct product rings are isomorphic. We also examine the structure of the clean graph over the ring $M_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ through their $Cl_2$ graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a multicolor variant of Erd\H{o}s--Rogers functions. Let $f_{\alpha_s; K_{i_1}, \cdots, K_{i_t}}(n)$ be the largest integer $m$ such that there is always an induced $K_s$-free subgraph of size $m$ in every $n$-vertex graph with a $t$-edge-coloring in which the edges with the $j$-th color induce no copy of $K_{i_j}$. We establish both upper and lower bounds for this multicolor version. Specifically, we show that $f_{\alpha_5; K_3, K_3}(n) = n^{1/2+o(1)}$, $\Omega(n^{5/11}) \le f_{\alpha_5; K_3, K_3, K_3}(n) \le n^{1/2+o(1)}$, and $\Omega(n^{20/61}) \le f_{\alpha_5; K_3, K_3, K_3, K_3}(n) \le n^{1/3+o(1)}$.</description>

      <title>On the number of triangles in $K_4$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s asked whether for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, the parameter $p^*(G)=\min \sum_{i\ge 1} (|V(G_i)|-1)$ is at most $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor$, where the minimum is taken over all edge decompositions of $G$ into edge-disjoint cliques $G_i$. In a restricted case (also conjectured independently by Erd\H{o}s), Gy\H{o}ri and Keszegh [Combinatorica, 37(6) (2017), 1113--1124] proved that $p^*(G)\leq \lfloor n^2/4\rfloor$ for all $K_4$-free graphs $G$. Motivated by their proof approach, they conjectured that for any $n$-vertex $K_4$-free graph $G$ with $e$ edges, and any greedy partition $P$ of $G$ of size $r$, the number of triangles in $G$ is at least $r(e-r(n-r))$. If true, this would imply a stronger bound on $p^*(G)$. In this paper, we disprove their conjecture by constructing infinitely many counterexamples with arbitrarily large gap. We further establish a corrected tight lower bound on the number of triangles in such graphs, which would recover the conjectured bound once some small counterexamples we identify are excluded.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that in games with imperfect information, such as poker, bluffing with some probability can be a component of the optimal strategy. However, as far as we know, nobody has ever exhibited a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy involves bluffing, or even a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy is a mixed (i.e., randomized) strategy. We present a carefully constructed Scrabble position, that could actually arise in a tournament game with no invalid words played, in which the optimal strategy (assuming that a tied score leads to the point being split equally, with no recourse to so-called "spread points" as a tie-breaking mechanism) is to make Move A with probability 1/3 and to make Move B with probability 2/3. Move B can reasonably be called a bluff, in the sense that it sets up a threat which the player cannot in fact execute, but which the opponent may not be able to rule out.</description>

      <title>Short history of signed exceptional sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas exceptional sequences have a long history with many well-known connections to combinatorics, signed exceptional sequences are relatively recent. The authors introduced this concept in 2017 [19], although it was retroactively realized that the category of noncrossing partitions [24] is a special case of this construction. Buan and Marsh [4] have introduced the concept of $\tau$-exceptional sequences to generalize the definitions and theorems to all finite dimensional algebras. This short paper is the story of the original concept of signed exceptional sequences for hereditary algebras and how it developed out of the two authors' study of algebraic K-theory, link invariants, and cluster combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores new arithmetic and combinatorial structures arising from the interplay between Farey-type graphs, Fibonacci expansions, and operadic constructions. We introduce Fibonadic numbers, defined as an inverse limit under the Zeckendorf shift, equipped with a metric, order, and commutative rig structure. A normalization lemma provides canonical representatives, while quotients of the non-zero Fibonadic numbers under shifts and it's fundamental domain covering the circle via phi-values. Levels with associated functions encoding the decomposition of X into arithmetic layers. This research links number theory, combinatorics, discrete dynamics, operads, fractal geometry and the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>The Horton-Strahler number of butterfly trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number (HS) is a measure of branching complexity of rooted trees, introduced in hydrology and later studied in parallel computing under the name register function. While its order of growth is well understood for classical random trees, fluctuation behavior has largely resisted analysis. In this work we investigate the HS in the setting of butterfly trees -- binary trees constructed from butterfly permutations, a rich class of separable permutations with origins in numerical linear algebra and parallel architectures. For the subclass of simple butterfly trees, we exploit their recursive gluing structure to model the HS as an additive functional of a finite-state Markov process. This framework yields sharp distributional results, including a law of large numbers and a Central Limit Theorem with explicit variance growth, providing what appears to be the first genuine Gaussian limit law for the HS in a nontrivial random tree model. Extending to biased constructions, we further establish functional limit theorems via analytic and probabilistic tools. For general butterfly trees, while exact analysis remains open, empirical sampling shows that the HS distribution is confined to a narrower support than in classical models, and appears to concentrate tightly near the upper bound $\lfloor \log_4 N\rfloor$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various card tricks involve under-down dealing, where alternatively one card is placed under the deck and the next card is dealt. We study how the cards need to be prepared in the deck to be dealt in order. The order in which the $N$ cards are prepared defines a permutation.
  In this work, we analyze general dealing patterns, considering properties of the resulting permutations. We give recursive formulas for these permutations, their inverses, the final dealt card, and the dealing order of the first card. We discuss some particular examples of dealing patterns and conclude with an analysis of several existing and novel magic card tricks making use of dealing patterns. Our discussions involve 30 existing sequences in the OEIS, and we introduce 44 new sequences to that database.</description>

      <title>Triangle-Covered Graphs: Algorithms, Complexity, and Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely studied edge modification problems ask how to minimally alter a graph to satisfy certain structural properties. In this paper, we introduce and study a new edge modification problem centered around transforming a given graph into a triangle-covered graph (one in which every vertex belongs to at least one triangle). We first present tight lower bounds on the number of edges in any connected triangle-covered graph of order $n$, and then we characterize all connected graphs that attain this minimum edge count. For a graph $G$, we define the notion of a $\Delta$-completion set as a set of non-edges of $G$ whose addition to $G$ results in a triangle-covered graph. We prove that the decision problem of finding a $\Delta$-completion set of size at most $t\geq0$ is $\mathbb{NP}$-complete and does not admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm under standard complexity assumptions. Moreover, we show that this problem remains $\mathbb{NP}$-complete even when the input is restricted to connected bipartite graphs. We then study the problem from an algorithmic perspective, providing tight bounds on the minimum $\Delta$-completion set size for several graph classes, including trees, chordal graphs, and cactus graphs. Furthermore, we show that the triangle-covered problem admits an $(\ln n +1)$-approximation algorithm for general graphs. For trees and chordal graphs, we design algorithms that compute minimum $\Delta$-completion sets. Finally, we show that the threshold for a random graph $\mathbb{G}(n, p)$ to be triangle-covered occurs at $n^{-2/3}$.</description>

Abstract: For a natural number $k&gt;1$, let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of distinct representations of a natural number $n$ of the form $p^k+q^k$ for primes $p,q$. We prove that, for all $k&gt;1$,
  $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}f_k(n)=\infty.$$
  This positively answers a conjecture of Erdos, which asks if there are natural numbers $n$ with arbitrarily many distinct representations of the form $p_1^k+p_2^k+\dots+p_k^k$ for primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$.</description>

Abstract: In "Meromorphic Functions and Analytic Curves", H. and F. J. Weyl identified an intriguing connection between holomorphic curves and their associated curves, which they referred to as the "peculiar relation". In this paper, we present a generalization of the Weyl peculiar relation and investigate a combinatorial structure underlying the Weyl--Ahlfors theory via standard Young tableaux. We also provide an alternative proof of the Second Main Theorem from the viewpoint of comparing the order functions $iT_p$ and $T_i\{\mathbf{X}^{(p)}\}$.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on Ultra-Log Concavity of the Grothendieck Class of $\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of the fine moduli space of stable $n$-pointed curves of genus zero, $\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}}$, in the Grothendieck ring of varieties encodes its Poincar\'e polynomial. Aluffi-Chen-Marcolli conjecture that the Grothendieck class of $\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}}$ is real-rooted (and hence ultra-log-concave), and they proved an asymptotic ultra-log-concavity result for these polynomials. We build upon their work, by providing effectively computable bounds for the error term in their asymptotic formula for $\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2l}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})$. As a consequence, we prove that in the range $l \le \frac{n}{10\log n}$, the ultra-log-concavity inequality \[\left(\frac{\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2(l-1)}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})}{\binom{n-3}{l-1}}\right)^2 \ge \frac{\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2(l-2)}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2l}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})}{\binom{n-3}{l-2}\binom{n-3}{l}} \]
  holds for $n$ sufficiently large.</description>

Abstract: The $l$-hypermaps, $l\ge2$, which generalize (dual of) ribbon graphs ($l=2$ case), are interesting enumerative objects. In this paper, based on a theorem of Carlet--van de Leur--Posthuma--Shadrin and the matrix-resolvent method, we derive an explicit formula for $k$-point generating series of enumeration of $l$-hypermaps, which generalizes the one obtained in [30] for the $l=2$ case. We also generalize a theorem of Dubrovin [29].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the homological shift ideals of powers of polymatroidal ideals. We prove that the first homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_1(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degree one as a module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. We conjecture that the $i$th homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degrees $\le i$, and we confirm it in many significant cases. We show that $I$ has the $1$st homological strong persistence property, and we conjecture that the sequence $\{\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^k)\}_{k&gt;0}$ of associated primes of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ becomes an increasing chain for $k\ge i$. This conjecture is established when $i=1$ and for many families of polymatroidal ideals. Finally, we explore componentwise polymatroidal ideals, and we prove that $\text{HS}_1(I)$ is again componentwise polymatroidal, if $I$ is componentwise polymatroidal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

Abstract: Let $L$ be an $n\times n$ array whose top left $r\times r$ subarray is filled with $k$ different symbols, each occurring at most once in each row and at most once in each column. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure the remaining cells of $L$ can be filled such that each symbol occurs at most once in each row and at most once in each column, $L$ is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, and each symbol occurs a prescribed number of times in $L$. The case where the prescribed number of times each symbol occurs is $n$ was solved by Cruse (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 16 (1974), 18--22), and the case where the top left subarray is $r\times n$ and the symmetry is not required, was settled by Goldwasser et al. (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 130 (2015), 26--41). Our result allows the entries of the main diagonal to be specified as well, which leads to an extension of the Andersen-Hoffman Theorem (Annals of Disc. Math. 15 (1982) 9--26, European J. Combin. 4 (1983) 33--35).</description>

Abstract: Completing partial latin squares is NP-complete. Motivated by Ryser's theorem for latin rectangles, in 1974, Cruse found conditions that ensure a partial symmetric latin square of order $m$ can be embedded in a symmetric latin square of order $n$. Loosely speaking, this results asserts that an $n$-coloring of the edges of the complete $m$-vertex graph $K_m$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $K_n$ if and only if $n$ is even and the number of edges of each color is at least $m-n/2$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which an edge-coloring of the complete $\lambda$-fold $m$-vertex 3-graph $\lambda K_m^3$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$. In particular, we prove the first known Ryser type theorem for hypergraphs by showing that if $n \equiv 0 \;(\bmod\; 3)$, any edge-coloring of $\lambda K_m^3$ where the number of triples of each color is at least $m/2-n/6$, can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$. Finally we prove an Evans type result by showing that if $n \equiv 0 \;(\bmod\; 3)$ and $n\geq 3m$, then any $q$-coloring of the edges of any $F\subseteq\lambda K_m^3$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$ as long as $q\leq \lambda \binom{n-1}{2}-\lambda \binom{m}{3}/\left\lfloor m/3 \right\rfloor$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Cops and Robbers game on graphs in which the robbers damage the visited vertices, aiming to maximize the number of damaged vertices. For that game with one cop against $s$ robbers a conjecture was made by Carlson, Halloran and Reinhart that the cop can save three vertices from being damaged as soon as the maximum degree of the base graph is at least $\binom{s}{2} + 2$.
  We are able to verify the conjecture and prove that it is tight once we add the assumption that the base graph is triangle free. We also study the game without that assumption, disproving the conjecture in full generality and further attempting to locate the smallest maximum degree of a base graph which guarantees that the cop can save three vertices against $s$ robbers. We show that this number is between $2\binom{s}{2} - 3$ and $2\binom{s}{2} + 1$.
  Furthermore, after the game has been previously studied with one cop and multiple robbers, as well as with one robber and multiple cops, we initiate the study of the game with two cops and two robbers. In the case when the base graph is a cycle we determine the exact number of damaged vertices. Additionally, when the base graph is a path we provide bounds that differ by an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Uncountably many enumerations of well-quasi-ordered permutation classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an uncountable family of well-quasi-ordered permutation classes, each with a distinct enumeration sequence. This disproves a conjecture that all well-quasi-ordered permutation classes have algebraic generating functions, and in fact shows that many such classes lack D-finite or D-algebraic generating functions. Our construction is based on an uncountably large collection of factor-closed, well-quasi-ordered binary languages due to Pouzet.</description>

      <title>Parity conditions for one-way rail networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present parity conditions under which a toy rail network is one-way, i.e., whether a direction can be assigned across the network so that all train journeys are completely consistent with it or completely consistent with its opposite. We show that this problem is equivalent to determining the balance of a signed graph obtained from the network, whose edges are assigned positive or negative signs. Using signed-graph theory, we derive two equivalent parity conditions for one-wayness: (i) every cycle must contain an even number of edges that join the same sides of switches, and (ii) every cycle must contain an even number of angles at switches. Signed-graph theory also offers an analytical criterion: A connected network is one-way if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian matrix is zero, suggesting a computational tool for evaluating one-wayness.</description>

      <title>Hyperoctahedral group characters and a type-BC analog of graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state combinatorial formulas for hyperoctahedral group ($\mathfrak B_n$) character evaluations of the form $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$, where ${{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1) \in \Bbb Z[\mathfrak B_n]$ is a type-BC Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element, with $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ corresponding to simultaneously smooth type-B and C Schubert varieties. We also extend the definition of symmetric group codominance to elements of $\mathfrak B_n$ and show that for each element $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ above, there exists a BC-codominant element $v \in \mathfrak B_n$ satisfying $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1)) = \chi( {{\widetilde C}_v}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for all $\mathfrak B_n$-characters $\chi$. Combinatorial structures and maps appearing in these formulas are type-BC extensions of planar networks, unit interval orders, indifference graphs, poset tableaux, and colorings. Using the ring of type-BC symmetric functions, we introduce natural generating functions $Y( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for the above evaluations. These provide a new type-BC analog of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions [Adv. Math. 111 (1995) pp. 166-194].</description>

      <title>The Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the concept of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result can be reduced to the unimodularity of the tensor product of two maximal circuits (here we call a vector system a maximal circuit, if it can be expressed as $B \cup \{ -\sum B \}$ with some basis $B$).</description>

      <title>Semistrong edge colorings of planar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strengthened notions of a matching $M$ of a graph $G$ have been considered, requiring that the matching $M$ has some properties with respect to the subgraph $G_M$ of $G$ induced by the vertices covered by $M$: If $M$ is the unique perfect matching of $G_M$, then $M$ is a \emph{uniquely restricted matching} of $G$; if all the edges of $M$ are pendant edges of $G_M$, then $M$ is a \emph{semistrong matching} of $G$; if all the vertices of $G_M$ are pendant, then $M$ is an \emph{induced matching} of $G$. Strengthened notions of edge coloring and of the chromatic index follow.
  In this paper, we consider the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with given maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove that graphs with maximum average degree less than ${14}/{5}$ have semistrong chromatic index (hence uniquely restricted chromatic index) at most $2\Delta+4$, and we reduce the bound to $2\Delta+2$ if the maximum average degree is less than ${8}/{3}$. These cases cover, in particular, the cases of planar graphs with girth at least 7 (resp. at least 8).
  Our result makes some progress on the conjecture of Lu{\v{z}}ar, Mockov{\v{c}}iakov{\'a} and Sot{\'a}k [J.~Graph Theory 105 (2024) 612--632], which asserts that every planar graph $G$ has a semistrong edge coloring with $2\Delta+C$ colors, for some universal constant $C$. (Note that such a conjecture would fail for strong edge coloring as there exist graphs with arbitrarily large maximum degree that are not strongly $(4\Delta-5)$-edge-colorable.) We provide an example of a planar graph showing that the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at least $2\Delta+4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mathematics education research, mathematics task sets involving mixed practice include tasks from many different topics within the same assignment. In this paper, we use graph decompositions to construct mixed practice task sets for Calculus I, focusing on derivative computation tasks, or tasks of the form "Compute $f'(x)$ of the function $f(x)=$ [elementary function]." A decomposition $D$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a collection $\{H_1, H_2, ... , H_t\}$ of nonempty subgraphs such that $H_i=G[E_i]$ for some nonempty subset $E_i$ of $E(G)$, and $\{E_1, E_2, ... , E_t\}$ is a partition of $E(G)$. We extend results on decompositions of the complete directed graph due to Meszka and Skupie\'n to construct balanced task sets that assess the Chain Rule.</description>

Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{C}$ has polynomial expansion if there is a polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, each of the depth-$r$ minors of $G$ has average degree at most $f(r)$. In this note, we study bounded-radius variants of some classical graph parameters such as bramble number, linkedness and well-linkedness, and we show that they are pairwise polynomially related. Furthermore, in a monotone graph class with polynomial expansion they are all uniformly bounded by a polynomial in $r$.</description>

Abstract: Let $r \ge 3$ be fixed and $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph. A long-standing conjecture of Gy\H{o}ri states that if $e(G) = t_{r-1}(n) + k$, where $t_{r-1}(n)$ denotes the number of edges of the Tur\'{a}n graph on $n$ vertices and $r - 1$ parts, then $G$ has at least $(2 - o(1))k/r$ edge disjoint $r$-cliques. We prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Claw-free cubic graphs are (1, 1, 1, 3)-packing edge-colorable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing positive integer sequence $S = (s_{1}, \dots, s_{k})$, an $S$-packing edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of the edge set of $G$ into subsets $E_{1}, \dots, E_{k}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$, the distance between any two distinct edges $e_{1}, e_{2} \in E_{i}$ is at least $s_{i} + 1$. Gastineau and Togni conjectured that cubic graphs, except the Petersen and Tietze graphs, admit $(1, 1, 1, 3)$-packing edge-colorings. In this paper, we prove that every claw-free cubic graph admits such a coloring.</description>

      <title>Totally odd subdivisions in Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As evidence for the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture, Simonyi and Zsb\'an (2010) showed that every Kneser graph $G$ with large enough order (compared to $\chi(G)$) contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$. A recent result of Steiner (2024), shows that every Schriver graph, and thus every Kneser graph, satisfies the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture, that is, it contains $K_{\chi(G)}$ as an odd minor. We strengthen these results for Kneser graphs in two ways. We show that for every $t\ge 8$, there are $t$-chromatic Kneser graphs that contain arbitrarily large complete totally odd subdivisions (and thus, odd minors). We also show that every Kneser graph contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$.
  Kneser graphs are the prime example of graphs having chromatic number equal to its topological lower bounds. Motivated by our main results, we also study totally odd immersions on graphs with this property, proving, in particular, that if the chromatic number of $G$ is equal to any of its topological lower bounds, then $G$ contains a totally odd immersion of $K_{\lfloor \chi(G)/2 \rfloor +1}$. This gives evidence for the immersion-analogue of the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Treedepth and 2-treedepth in graphs with no long induced paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Huynh, Joret, Micek, Seweryn, and Wollan (Combinatorica, 2022) introduced a graph parameter, later referred to as 2-treedepth and denoted $\mathrm{td}_2(\cdot)$. The parameter is the natural 2-connected version of treedepth. For every graph, 2-treedepth is at most the treedepth but can be much smaller: long paths have arbitrary treedepth but 2-treedepth equal to 2. We prove a converse showing that every graph with no induced path on $t$ vertices and 2-treedepth at most $k$ has treedepth at most $g(k, t)$. In fact, we determine the value of the function $g$ up to a multiplicative factor of 2.
  Additionally, we give asymptotically tight bounds for the problem of forcing long induced paths in graphs with long paths and bounded 2-treedepth or bounded pathwidth. The latter result answers a question of Hilaire and Raymond (E-JC, 2024).</description>

Abstract: We study transformations between discrete Morse functions on a finite simplicial complex via birth-death transitions--elementary chain maps between discrete Morse complexes that either create or cancel pairs of critical simplices. We prove that any two discrete Morse functions $f_1$, $f_2$ on a finite simplicial complex $K$ are linked by a finite sequence of such transitions.As applications, we present alternative proofs of several of Forman's fundamental results in discrete Morse theory and study the topology of the space of discrete Morse functions.</description>

      <title>Localization: A Framework to Generalize Extremal Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremal graph theory studies the maximum or minimum number of subgraphs isomorphic to a prescribed graph under given constraints. \textit{Localization} has recently emerged as a framework that refines such problems by assigning extremal quantities locally (to vertices or edges) and then aggregating them. This perspective not only recovers classical results but also leads to sharper bounds.
  A classical result states that a connected planar graph with a finite girth $g$ satisfies \begin{equation*}
  m \leq \frac{g}{g-2}(n-2) \end{equation*} Wood~\cite{wood} derived upper bounds on the number of $K_t$-cliques in graphs of bounded maximum degree, expressed in terms of both the number of vertices and the number of edges: \begin{align*}
  ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t} \\ mex(m,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{d+1}{2}}\binom{d+1}{t} \end{align*} More recently, Chakraborty and Chen~\cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established a similar upper bound for graphs with bounded path length: \begin{equation*}
  mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t} \end{equation*}
  In this paper, we employ the localization framework to improve these bounds and provide structural characterizations of the extremal graphs attaining them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar Tu\'{a}n number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is defined as the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ remains a mystery when $H$ is large (for example, $H$ is a long path or a long cycle), while tight bounds have been established for many small planar graphs such as cycles, paths, $\Theta$-graphs and other small graphs formed by a union of them.
  One representative graph among such union graphs is $K_1+L$ where $L$ is a linear forest without isolated vertices.
  Previous works solved the cases when $L$ is a path or a matching.
  In this work, we first investigate the planar Tur\'{a}n number of the graph $K_1+L$ when $L$ is the disjoint union of a $P_2$ and $P_3$.
  Equivalently, $K_1+L$ represents a specific configuration formed by combining a $C_3$ and a $\Theta_4$.
  We further consider the planar Tur\'{a}n numbers of the all graphs obtained by combining $C_3$ and $\Theta_4$. Among the six possible such configurations, three have been resolved in earlier works. For the remaining three configurations (including
  $K_1+(P_2\dot{\cup}P_3)$), we derive tight bounds. Furthermore, we completely characterize all extremal graphs for the remaining two of these three cases.</description>

      <title>How to find all extremal graphs using symmetric subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of graphs with $\min_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\chi(F)=r+1\geq3$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. Set $t=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|$. Let ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with maximum edges among all the graphs of order $n$ without any $F\in\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Let $T(n,r)$ be the Tur\'{a}n graph of order $n$ with $r$ parts. Assume that some $F_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$ is a subgraph of the graph obtained from $T(rt,r)$ by embedding a path in its one part. Simonovits \cite{S1} introduced the concept of symmetric subgraphs, and proved that there exist graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ which have symmetrical property. In this paper, we aim to find a way to characterize all the extremal graphs for such $\mathcal{F}$ using symmetric subgraphs. Some new extremal results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. III. Excluding a fat tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour proved that for every finite tree $H$, there exists $k$ such that every finite graph $G$ with no $H$ minor has path-width at most $k$; and conversely, for every integer $k$, there is a finite tree $H$ such that every finite graph $G$ with an $H$ minor has path-width more than $k$. If we (twice) replace ``path-width'' by ``line-width'', the same is true for infinite graphs $G$.
  We prove a ``coarse graph theory'' analogue, as follows. For every finite tree $H$ and every $c$, there exist $k,L,C$ such that every graph that does not contain $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits an $(L,C)$-quasi-isonetry to a graph with line-width at most $k$; and conversely, for all $k,L,C$ there exist $c$ and a finite tree $H$ such that every graph that contains $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits no $(L,C)$-quasi-isometry to a graph with line-width at most $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the line graph of a pure simplicial complex. We prove that, as in the case of line graphs of simple graphs, one can compute the second graded Betti number of the facet ideal of a pure simplicial complex in terms of the combinatorial structure of its line graph. We characterize those pure simplicial complexes whose line graph is a complete (bipartite) graph. We give conditions that line graphs of simplicial complexes should fulfill.</description>

      <title>Tree-tubings and the combinatorics of resurgent Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Computing the probability of intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $i$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Berele row-insertion and quantum symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berele row-insertion is a symplectic analogue of the Schensted row-insertion. In the present paper, we provide it with a representation theoretical interpretation via the quantum symmetric pairs of type $A\mathrm{II}$. As applications, we lift Berele's Robinson--Schensted correspondence and Kobayashi--Matsumura's Robinson--Schensted--Knuth (RSK for short) correspondence to isomorphisms of representations over a quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebra, and establish the dual RSK correspondence of type $A\mathrm{II}$.</description>
