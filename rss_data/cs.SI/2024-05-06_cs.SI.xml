      <title>Which Identities Are Mobilized: Towards an automated detection of social group appeals in political texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computational text classification strategy to identify references to social groups in European party manifestos and beyond. Our methodology uses machine learning techniques, including BERT and large language models, to capture group-based appeals in texts. We propose to combine automated identification of social groups using the Mistral-7B-v0.1 Large Language Model with Embedding Space-based filtering to extend a sample of core social groups to all social groups mentioned in party manifestos. By applying this approach to RRP's and mainstream parties' group images in manifestos, we explore whether electoral dynamics explain similarities in group appeals and potential convergence or divergence in party strategies. Contrary to expectations, increasing RRP support or mainstream parties' vote loss does not necessarily lead to convergence in group appeals. Nonetheless, our methodology enables mapping similarities in group appeals across time and space in 15 European countries from 1980 to 2021 and can be transferred to other use cases as well.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Botometer: Adversarial Analysis for Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bots play a significant role in many online social networks (OSN) as they imitate human behavior. This fact raises difficult questions about their capabilities and potential risks. Given the recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI), social bots are capable of producing highly realistic and complex content that mimics human creativity. As the malicious social bots emerge to deceive people with their unrealistic content, identifying them and distinguishing the content they produce has become an actual challenge for numerous social platforms. Several approaches to this problem have already been proposed in the literature, but the proposed solutions have not been widely evaluated. To address this issue, we evaluate the behavior of a text-based bot detector in a competitive environment where some scenarios are proposed: \textit{First}, the tug-of-war between a bot and a bot detector is examined. It is interesting to analyze which party is more likely to prevail and which circumstances influence these expectations. In this regard, we model the problem as a synthetic adversarial game in which a conversational bot and a bot detector are engaged in strategic online interactions. \textit{Second}, the bot detection model is evaluated under attack examples generated by a social bot; to this end, we poison the dataset with attack examples and evaluate the model performance under this condition. \textit{Finally}, to investigate the impact of the dataset, a cross-domain analysis is performed. Through our comprehensive evaluation of different categories of social bots using two benchmark datasets, we were able to demonstrate some achivement that could be utilized in future works.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Player Involvement in the Indian Pro Kabaddi League: A Network Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to apply network analysis to all players who have participated in the Indian Pro Kabaddi League since its inception. The Kabaddi network has been constructed based on the number of teams and players they have played with. The players have been ranked with the help of the degree and PageRank algorithm. Small-world phenomenon is observed in the Kabaddi network. The significance of the player performance has been compared with the player rank received by the network analysis.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Optimization Studies of Group Centrality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrality metrics have become a popular concept in network science and optimization. Over the years, centrality has been used to assign importance and identify influential elements in various settings, including transportation, infrastructure, biological, and social networks, among others. That said, most of the literature has focused on nodal versions of centrality. Recently, group counterparts of centrality have started attracting scientific and practitioner interest. The identification of sets of nodes that are influential within a network is becoming increasingly more important. This is even more pronounced when these sets of nodes are required to induce a certain motif or structure. In this study, we review group centrality metrics from an operations research and optimization perspective for the first time. This is particularly interesting due to the rapid evolution and development of this area in the operations research community over the last decade. We first present a historical overview of how we have reached this point in the study of group centrality. We then discuss the different structures and motifs that appear prominently in the literature, alongside the techniques and methodologies that are popular. We finally present possible avenues and directions for future work, mainly in three areas: (i) probabilistic metrics to account for randomness along with stochastic optimization techniques; (ii) structures and relaxations that have not been yet studied; and (iii) new emerging applications that can take advantage of group centrality. Our survey offers a concise review of group centrality and its intersection with network analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social learning is a non-Bayesian framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents towards a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Neural Common Neighbor with Completion for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel link prediction model and further boost it by studying graph incompleteness. First, we introduce MPNN-then-SF, an innovative architecture leveraging structural feature (SF) to guide MPNN's representation pooling, with its implementation, namely Neural Common Neighbor (NCN). NCN exhibits superior expressiveness and scalability compared with existing models, which can be classified into two categories: SF-then-MPNN, augmenting MPNN's input with SF, and SF-and-MPNN, decoupling SF and MPNN. Second, we investigate the impact of graph incompleteness -- the phenomenon that some links are unobserved in the input graph -- on SF, like the common neighbor. Through dataset visualization, we observe that incompleteness reduces common neighbors and induces distribution shifts, significantly affecting model performance. To address this issue, we propose to use a link prediction model to complete the common neighbor structure. Combining this method with NCN, we propose Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC). NCN and NCNC outperform recent strong baselines by large margins, and NCNC further surpasses state-of-the-art models in standard link prediction benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/NeuralCommonNeighbor.</description>

      <title>Automated Transparency: A Legal and Empirical Analysis of the Digital Services Act Transparency Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a much awaited platforms liability reform in the European Union that was adopted on 1 November 2022 with the ambition to set a global example in terms of accountability and transparency. Among other obligations, the DSA emphasizes the need for online platforms to report on their content moderation decisions (`statements of reasons' - SoRs), which is a novel transparency mechanism we refer to as automated transparency in this study. SoRs are currently made available in the DSA Transparency Database, launched by the European Commission in September 2023. The DSA Transparency Database marks a historical achievement in platform governance, and allows investigations about the actual transparency gains, both at structure level as well as at the level of platform compliance. This study aims to understand whether the Transparency Database helps the DSA to live up to its transparency promises. We use legal and empirical arguments to show that while there are some transparency gains, compliance remains problematic, as the current database structure allows for a lot of discretion from platforms in terms of transparency practices. In our empirical study, we analyze a representative sample of the Transparency Database (131m SoRs) submitted in November 2023, to characterise and evaluate platform content moderation practices.</description>
