      <title>Synthetic Founders: AI-Generated Social Simulations for Startup Validation Research in Computational Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation. Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes - commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps - founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes - relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category - capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation of Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape; and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Research is the New Analytics System: Towards Building the Runtime for AI-Driven Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets. Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent, our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its optimized execution.</description>

      <title>Too Noisy to Collude? Algorithmic Collusion Under Laplacian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous pricing systems has sparked growing concern over algorithmic collusion in markets from retail to housing. This paper examines controlled information quality as an ex ante policy lever: by reducing the fidelity of data that pricing algorithms draw on, regulators can frustrate collusion before supracompetitive prices emerge. We show, first, that information quality is the central driver of competitive outcomes, shaping prices, profits, and consumer welfare. Second, we demonstrate that collusion can be slowed or destabilized by injecting carefully calibrated noise into pooled market data, yielding a feasibility region where intervention disrupts cartels without undermining legitimate pricing. Together, these results highlight information control as a lightweight yet practical lever to blunt digital collusion at its source.</description>

      <title>Approximate constrained stochastic optimal control via parameterized input inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate methods to solve stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems have received significant interest from researchers in the past decade. Probabilistic inference approaches to SOC have been developed to solve nonlinear quadratic Gaussian problems. In this work, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based inference procedure to generate state-feedback controls for constrained SOC problems. We consider the inequality constraints for the state and controls and also the structural constraints for the controls. We employ barrier functions to address state and control constraints. We show that the expectation step leads to smoothing of the state-control pair while the the maximization step on the non-zero subsets of the control parameters allows inference of structured stochastic optimal controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on unicycle obstacle avoidance, four-unicycle formation control, and quadcopter navigation in windy environment examples. In these examples, we perform an empirical study on the parametric effect of barrier functions on the state constraint satisfaction. We also present a comparative study of smoothing algorithms on the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Population-aware Online Mirror Descent for Mean-Field Games with Common Noise by Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</description>

      <title>AgenTracer: Who Is Inducing Failure in the LLM Agentic Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&amp;When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Task Assignment via Inexact ADMM for unplanned online tasks and its Applications to Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-robot system (MRS) applications, efficient task assignment is essential not only for coordinating agents and ensuring mission success but also for maintaining overall system security. In this work, we first propose an optimization-based distributed task assignment algorithm that dynamically assigns mandatory security-critical tasks and optional tasks among teams. Leveraging an inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based approach, we decompose the task assignment problem into separable and non-separable subproblems. The non-separable subproblems are transformed into an inexact ADMM update by projected gradient descent, which can be performed through several communication steps within the team.
  In the second part of this paper, we formulate a comprehensive framework that enables MRS under plan-deviation attacks to handle online tasks without compromising security. The process begins with a security analysis that determines whether an online task can be executed securely by a robot and, if so, the required time and location for the robot to rejoin the team. Next, the proposed task assignment algorithm is used to allocate security-related tasks and verified online tasks. Finally, task fulfillment is managed using a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-based controller, while security enforcement is ensured through a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based security filter. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework allows MRS to effectively respond to unplanned online tasks while maintaining security guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Reliable Self-Organized Distributed Complex Network for Communication of Smart Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaboration is a fundamental and essential characteristic of many complex systems, ranging from ant colonies to human societies. Each component within a complex system interacts with others, even at a distance, to accomplish a given task. A network of collaboration can be defined to study the collective behavior of such systems within the framework of complex networks. The nodes in these networks may represent simple organisms or more sophisticated intelligent agents, such as humans. In this study, we utilize intelligent agents (nodes) trained through reinforcement learning techniques to establish connections with their neighbors, ultimately leading to the emergence of a large-scale communication cluster. Notably, there is no centralized administrator; instead, agents must adjust their connections based on information obtained from local observations. The connection strategy is formulated using a physical Hamiltonian, thereby categorizing this intelligent system under the paradigm of "Physics-Guided Machine Learning". The resulting self-organized distributed complex network has numerous industrial applications, including constructing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The design of such networks often encounters challenges, the most critical of which is ensuring effective connectivity for reliable communication while optimizing energy consumption. IoT networks are inherently dynamic in many real-world applications, such as Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), where nodes are mobile, and the connection topology evolves rapidly over time. These systems require a robust and rapidly self-organizing communication network. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed intelligent agents facilitate the formation of self-organized complex networks capable of maintaining network-wide connectivity across various dynamic scenarios while simultaneously optimizing average electrical power consumption.</description>

      <title>Murakkab: Resource-Efficient Agentic Workflow Orchestration in Cloud Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy, latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that Murakkab reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by 4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.</description>

      <title>MF-OML: Online Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning with Occupation Measures for Large Population Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning for multi-agent games has attracted lots of attention recently. However, given the challenge of solving Nash equilibria for large population games, existing works with guaranteed polynomial complexities either focus on variants of zero-sum and potential games, or aim at solving (coarse) correlated equilibria, or require access to simulators, or rely on certain assumptions that are hard to verify. This work proposes MF-OML (Mean-Field Occupation-Measure Learning), an online mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of large population sequential symmetric games. MF-OML is the first fully polynomial multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for provably solving Nash equilibria (up to mean-field approximation gaps that vanish as the number of players $N$ goes to infinity) beyond variants of zero-sum and potential games. When evaluated by the cumulative deviation from Nash equilibria, the algorithm is shown to achieve a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{3/4}+N^{-1/2}M)$ for games with the strong Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, and a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{11/12}+N^{- 1/6}M)$ for games with only the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, where $M$ is the total number of episodes and $N$ is the number of agents of the game. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first tractable globally convergent computational algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of monotone mean-field games.</description>

      <title>The Nah Bandit: Modeling User Non-compliance in Recommendation Systems</title>

Abstract: Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendation if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces the Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say `nah' to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize Memories via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.
