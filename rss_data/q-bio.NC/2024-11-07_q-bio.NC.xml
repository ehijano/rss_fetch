      <title>Do Mice Grok? Glimpses of Hidden Progress During Overtraining in Sensory Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does learning of task-relevant representations stop when behavior stops changing? Motivated by recent theoretical advances in machine learning and the intuitive observation that human experts continue to learn from practice even after mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning can continue, even when behavior plateaus. In a novel reanalysis of recently published neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform cortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior saturates at near-ceiling performance ("overtraining"). This learning is marked by an increase in decoding accuracy from piriform neural populations and improved performance on held-out generalization tests. We demonstrate that class representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so that examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining can abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior during that time. We hypothesize this hidden yet rich learning takes the form of approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in the neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that recapitulates these phenomena. We conclude by showing how this model of late-time feature learning implies an explanation for the empirical puzzle of overtraining reversal in animal learning, where task-specific representations are more robust to particular task changes because the learned features can be reused.</description>

      <title>RTify: Aligning Deep Neural Networks with Human Behavioral Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03630</link>

Abstract: Current neural network models of primate vision focus on replicating overall levels of behavioral accuracy, often neglecting perceptual decisions' rich, dynamic nature. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework to model the dynamics of human behavioral choices by learning to align the temporal dynamics of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to human reaction times (RTs). We describe an approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated against various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation can be used to optimize an "ideal-observer" RNN model to achieve an optimal tradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is found to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to train a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making model. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image stimuli. Overall, we present a novel framework that helps align current vision models with human behavior, bringing us closer to an integrated model of human vision.</description>

      <title>Flexible task abstractions emerge in linear networks with fast and bounded units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but such data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Triple Interactions in Resting fMRI: Insights into Psychotic Disorders</title>

Abstract: The human brain dynamically integrated and configured information to adapt to the environment. To capture these changes over time, dynamic second-order functional connectivity was typically used to capture transient brain patterns. However, dynamic second-order functional connectivity typically ignored interactions beyond pairwise relationships. To address this limitation, we utilized dynamic triple interactions to investigate multiscale network interactions in the brain. In this study, we evaluated a resting-state fMRI dataset that included individuals with psychotic disorders (PD). We first estimated dynamic triple interactions using resting-state fMRI. After clustering, we estimated cohort-specific and cohort-common states for controls (CN), schizophrenia (SZ), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD). From the cohort-specific states, we observed significant triple interactions, particularly among visual, subcortical, and somatomotor networks, as well as temporal and higher cognitive networks in SZ. In SAD, key interactions involved temporal networks in the initial state and somatomotor networks in subsequent states. From the cohort-common states, we observed that high-cognitive networks were primarily involved in SZ and SAD compared to CN. Furthermore, the most significant differences between SZ and SAD also existed in high-cognitive networks. In summary, we studied PD using dynamic triple interaction, the first time such an approach has been used to study PD. Our findings highlighted the significant potential of dynamic high-order functional connectivity, paving the way for new avenues in the study of the healthy and disordered human brain.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Correlation Networks: High-Order Interactions in the Topology of Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand collective network behavior in the complex human brain, pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.</description>
