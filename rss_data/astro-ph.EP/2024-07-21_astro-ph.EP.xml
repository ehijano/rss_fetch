      <title>The First Evidence of a Host Star Metallicity Cut-off In The Formation of Super-Earth Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation is expected to be severely limited in disks of low metallicity, owing to both the small solid mass reservoir and the low opacity accelerating the disk gas dissipation. While previous studies have found a weak correlation between the occurrence rates of small planets ($\leq$4R$_\oplus$) and stellar metallicity, so far no studies have probed below the metallicity limit beyond which planet formation is predicted to be suppressed. Here, we constructed a large catalog of ~110,000 metal-poor stars observed by the TESS mission with spectroscopically-derived metallicities, and systematically probed planet formation within the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) for the first time. Extrapolating known higher-metallicity trends for small, short-period planets predicts the discovery of ~68 superEarths around these stars (~85,000 stars) after accounting for survey completeness; however, we detect none. As a result, we have placed the most stringent upper limit on super-Earth occurrence rates around metal-poor stars (-0.75 &lt; [Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) to date, $\leq$ 1.67%, a statistically significant (p-value=0.000685) deviation from the prediction of metallicity trends derived with Kepler and K2. We find a clear host star metallicity cliff for super-Earths that could indicate the threshold below which planets are unable to grow beyond an Earth-mass at short orbital periods. This finding provides a crucial input to planet formation theories, and has implications for the small planet inventory of the Galaxy and the galactic epoch at which the formation of small planets started.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark JWST Near-Infrared Spectrum for the Exoplanet WASP-39b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy supplies detailed information on their atmospheric composition, physics, and chemistry. Prior to JWST, these observations were limited to a narrow wavelength range across the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared, alongside broadband photometry at longer wavelengths. To understand more complex properties of exoplanet atmospheres, improved wavelength coverage and resolution are necessary to robustly quantify the influence of a broader range of absorbing molecular species. Here we present a combined analysis of JWST transmission spectroscopy across four different instrumental modes spanning 0.5-5.2 micron using Early Release Science observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b. Our uniform analysis constrains the orbital and stellar parameters within sub-percent precision, including matching the precision obtained by the most precise asteroseismology measurements of stellar density to-date, and further confirms the presence of Na, K, H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, and SO$_2$ atmospheric absorbers. Through this process, we also improve the agreement between the transmission spectra of all modes, except for the NIRSpec PRISM, which is affected by partial saturation of the detector. This work provides strong evidence that uniform light curve analysis is an important aspect to ensuring reliability when comparing the high-precision transmission spectra provided by JWST.</description>

      <title>Main-sequence systems: orbital stability around single star hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is one of the most fundamental aspects regarding planetary systems. It plays an important role in our understanding on the formation channel of the planetary systems, as well as their habitability. Many approaches have been adopted to determine the stability of these systems, including brute-force N-body simulations, semi-analytical calculations, and more recently machine learning methods. This allows significant advances in our understanding of planetary system dynamics, as well as providing tools to constrain unknown parameters of exoplanetary systems (assuming these systems are stable). In the following, we focus on planets around single star hosts, and we provide an overview of the studies of planetary system stability for compact multi-planet systems and hierarchical multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Main-sequence systems: orbital stability in stellar binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of star formation results in binaries or higher multiple systems, and planets in such systems are constrained to a limited range of orbital parameters in order to remain stable against perturbations from stellar companions. Many planets have been discovered in such multiple systems (such as stellar binaries), and understanding their stability is important in exoplanet searches and characterization. In this chapter, we focus on the orbital stability of planets in stellar binaries. We review key results based on semi-analytical secular (long term) methods, as well as results based on N-body simulations and more recent Machine Learning methods. We discuss planets orbiting one of the stellar binary components (S-type) and those orbiting both stars (P-type) separately.</description>

      <title>Formation and desorption of sulfur chains (H$_2$S$_x$ and S$_x$) in cometary ice: effects of ice composition and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reservoir of sulfur accounting for sulfur depletion in the gas of dense clouds and circumstellar regions is still unclear. One possibility is the formation of sulfur chains, which would be difficult to detect by spectroscopic techniques. This work explores the formation of sulfur chains experimentally, both in pure H$_2$S ice samples and in H$_2$O:H$_2$S ice mixtures. An ultra-high vacuum chamber, ISAC, eqquipped with FTIR and QMS, was used for the experiments. Our results show that the formation of H$_2$S$_x$ species is efficient, not only in pure H$_2$S ice samples, but also in water-rich ice samples. Large sulfur chains are formed more efficiently at low temperatures ($\approx$10 K), while high temperatures ($\approx$50 K) favour the formation of short sulfur chains. Mass spectra of H$_2$S$_x$, x~=~2-6, species are presented for the first time. Their analysis suggests that H$_2$S$_x$ species are favoured in comparison with S$_x$ chains. Nevertheless, the detection of several S$_x^+$ fragments at high temperatures in H$_2$S:H$_2$O ice mixtures suggests the presence of S$_8$ in the irradiated ice samples, which could sublimate from 260~K. ROSINA instrument data from the cometary Rosetta mission detected mass-to-charge ratios 96 and 128. Comparing these detections with our experiments, we propose two alternatives: 1) H$_2$S$_4$ and H$_2$S$_5$ to be responsible of those S$_3^+$ and S$_4^+$ cations, respectively, or 2) S$_8$ species, sublimating and being fragmented in the mass spectrometer. If S$_8$ is the parent molecule, then S$_5^+$ and S$_6^+$ cations could be also detected in future missions by broadening the mass spectrometer range.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope (CE) evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption is $\sim$$0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WD.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Different Phases of a Solar Flare on Changes in the Total Electron Content in the Earth's Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations in X-ray and EUV irradiance during solar flares lead to a noticeable increase in the electron concentration in the illuminated part of the Earth's ionosphere. Due to the large amount of experimental data accumulated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the total electron content (TEC) response to the impulsive phase of a solar flare has been studied quite well. However, recent studies have shown that large fraction of X-class flares have second strong peak of warm coronal emission (which is called 'EUV late phase'), whose influence on the ionization of ionospheric layers is not yet clear. A combined analysis of successive solar emissions and the caused TEC changes made it possible to numerically estimate the ionospheric response to the impulsive, gradual, and late phases of the X2.9 solar flare occurred on 2011 November 3 and demonstrate the high geoeffectiveness of the rather weak Fe XV 28.4 nm solar emission during the EUV late phase. It was found that the ionospheric response to the relatively weak emissions of the EUV late phase of the X2.9 solar flare amounted to almost a third of the TEC increase during the impulsive phase.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Hydrocarbons detected by JWST/MIRI in the inner disk of Sz28 consistent with a high C/O gas-phase chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST, we acquire unprecedented insights into the physical and chemical structure of the inner regions of planet-forming disks where terrestrial planet formation occurs. The very low-mass stars (VLMS) are known to have a high occurrence rate of the terrestrial planets around them. Exploring the chemical composition of the gas in these inner regions of the disks can aid a better understanding of the connection between planet-forming disks and planets. The MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) project is a large JWST Guaranteed Time program to characterize the chemistry and physical state of planet-forming and debris disks. We use the JWST-MIRI/MRS spectrum to investigate the gas and dust composition of the planet-forming disk around the very low-mass star Sz28 (M5.5, 0.12\,M$_{\odot}$). We use the dust-fitting tool (DuCK) to determine the dust continuum and to get constraints on the dust composition and grain sizes. We use 0D slab models to identify and fit the molecular spectral features, yielding estimates on the temperature, column density and the emitting area. To test our understanding of the chemistry in the disks around VLMS, we employ the thermo-chemical disk model {P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O}} and investigate the reservoirs of the detected hydrocarbons. We explore how the C/O ratio affects the inner disk chemistry. JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including \ce{CH3}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H2}, \ce{^{13}CCH2}, \ce{C2H6}, \ce{C3H4}, \ce{C4H2} and \ce{C6H6} suggesting a disk with a gaseous C/O\,&gt;\,1. Additionally, we detect \ce{CO2}, \ce{^{13}CO2}, \ce{HCN}, and \ce{HC3N}. \ce{H2O} and OH are absent in the spectrum. We do not detect PAHs. Photospheric stellar absorption lines of \ce{H2O} and \ce{CO} are identified. Notably, our radiation thermo-chemical disk models are able to produce these detected hydrocarbons in the surface layers of the disk when the ...</description>

      <title>Outflow Driven by a Protoplanet Embedded in the TW Hya Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas giant planets are formed by gas accretion onto planetary cores in protoplanetary disks. However, direct evidence of this process is still lacking, limiting our understanding of planetary formation processes. During mass accretion, planet-driven outflows may be launched, which could be observable by shock tracers such as sulfur monoxide (SO). We report the detection of SO gas in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. The $\rm SO\ J=8_7 - 7_6\ $ emission line is detected at a $6\sigma$ significance and localized to the southeast region of the disk with an arc-like morphology. The line center is red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity by $\sim5\ \rm km\ s^{-1}$. The starting point of the SO emission is located at a planet-carved dust gap at $42$ au. We attribute this to an outflow driven by an embedded protoplanet. Indeed, the observed morphology is well reproduced by a ballistic outflow model. The outflow velocity suggests that the outflow launching source has a mass of $\sim 4 M_\oplus\ (0.012 M_{\rm Jup})$ and the mass-loss rate is $3\times10^{-8} - 1\times10^{-6}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$. With the relation of mass-loss and mass-accretion rates established for protostars, we estimated the mass-accretion rate onto the protoplanet to be $3\times10^{-7} - 1\times10^{-5}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$, which matches theoretical predictions for a $\sim 4 M_\oplus$ planet at this separation. The detection of planet-driven outflow provides us a unique opportunity to directly probe the earliest phase of gas giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Discovery and Evolution of a Possible New Epoch of Cometary Activity by the Centaur (2060) Chiron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centaurs are small Solar System objects on chaotic orbits in the giant planet region, forming an evolutionary continuum with the Kuiper belt objects and Jupiter-family comets. Some Centaurs are known to exhibit cometary activity, though unlike comets this activity tends not to correlate with heliocentric distance and the mechanism behind it is currently poorly understood. We utilize serendipitous observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), Dark Energy Survey (DES), and Gaia in addition to targeted follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope South (TRAPPIST-South), and Gemini North telescope to analyze an unexpected brightening exhibited by the known active Centaur (2060) Chiron in 2021. This is highly indicative of a cometary outburst. As of 2023 February, Chiron has still not returned to its pre-brightening magnitude. We find Chiron's rotational lightcurve, phase curve effects, and possible high-albedo surface features to be unlikely causes of this observed brightening. We consider the most likely cause to be an epoch of either new or increased cometary activity, though we cannot rule out a possible contribution from Chiron's reported ring system, such as a collision of as-yet unseen satellites shepherding the rings. We find no evidence for coma in our Gemini or TRAPPIST-South observations, though this does not preclude the possibility that Chiron is exhibiting a coma that is too faint for observation or constrained to the immediate vicinity of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>A mm and near-IR study of YSOs: from outbursting protostars to satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are in a golden era observing Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), protoplanetary disks, and substellar objects, crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. This Ph.D. thesis explores two binary systems.
  Firstly, we study an eruptive YSO, HBC 494, using ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) observations. It's a FUor system in Orion Molecular Cloud with a resolved binary system: HBC 494 N (primary) and HBC 494 S (secondary) separated by 75 au. The disks show hints of aligned formation scenarios, with HBC 494 N being brighter and larger. Molecular line observations reveal bipolar outflows and rotating envelopes. Cavity features within the continuum disks' area suggest continuum over-subtraction or slow-moving jets and chemical destruction along the line-of-sight.
  Secondly, we examine the young binary system $\eta$ Tel using VLT/SPHERE H band imaging. It consists of an A-type star and a brown dwarf companion $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 208 au. Astrometric measurements over 19 years yield a low eccentric orbit with an inclination of 81.9 degrees. The mass of $\eta$ Tel B is determined to be 48 M$_{Jup}$, consistent with previous literature. No significant residual indicative of a satellite or disk surrounding the companion is detected, with limits ruling out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B at separations down to 33 au with masses as low as 1.6M$_{Jup}$.
  These studies employ sub-mm to near-IR observations, highlighting the complexity of (sub)stellar formation/evolution. This thesis contributes diverse analyses, providing insights into these intriguing processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we aim to summarise the efforts of the Italian SKA scientific community in conducting surveys of star-forming regions within our Galaxy, in the development of astrochemical research on protostellar envelopes and disks, and in studying the planet formation process itself. The objective is dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust throughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine protoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules, such as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit significantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: Accreting in the first few million years (Ma) of the Solar System, planetesimals record conditions in the protoplanetary disc and are the remnants of planetary formation processes. The meteorite paleomagnetic record carries key insights into the thermal history of planetesimals and their extent of differentiation. The current paradigm splits the meteorite paleomagnetic record into three magnetic field generation epochs: an early nebula field ($\lesssim$5 Ma after CAI formation), followed by thermal dynamos ($\sim$5-34 Ma after CAI formation), then a gap in dynamo generation, before the onset of core solidification and compositional dynamos. These epochs have been defined using current thermal evolution and dynamo generation models of planetesimals. Here, we demonstrate these epochs are not as distinct as previously thought based on refined thermal evolution models that include more realistic parametrisations for mantle convection, non-eutectic core solidification, and radiogenic $^{60}Fe$ in the core. We find thermal dynamos can start earlier and last longer. Inclusion of appreciable $^{60}Fe$ in the core brings forward the onset of dynamo generation to $\sim$1-2 Ma after CAI formation, which overlaps with the existence of the nebula field. The second epoch of dynamo generation begins prior to the onset of core solidification, suggesting this epoch is not purely compositionally driven. Planetesimal radius is the dominant control on the strength and duration of dynamo generation, and the choice of reference viscosity can widen the gap between epochs of dynamo generation from 0-200 Ma. Overall, variations in planetesimal properties lead to more variable timings of different planetesimal magnetic field generation mechanisms than previously thought. This alters the information we can glean from the meteorite paleomagnetic record about the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Widespread disruption of resonant chains during protoplanetary disk dispersal</title>

Abstract: We describe the evolution of low mass planets in a dispersing protoplanetary disk around a Solar mass star. The disk model is based on the results of Yu, Hansen &amp; Hasegawa (2023), which describes a region of the inner disk where the direction of the migration torque is outwards due to the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk and the resultant gradual increase in surface density outwards. We demonstrate that the magnetospheric rebound phase in such a disk leads to diverging orbits for double and triple planet systems, and the disruption of a high fraction of the initial resonant chains.
  We present simulations of three planet systems with masses based on the observed triple planet systems observed by the Kepler satellite within the context of this model. The final distribution of nearest neighbour period ratios provides an excellent fit to the observations, provided that the initial resonant configurations are compact. The occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period also provides a good match to the observations, for final orbital periods P&lt;20 days.
  These results suggest that the period and period ratio distributions of low mass planets are primarily set in place during the disk dispersal epoch, and may not require significant dynamical evolution thereafter.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>

Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>

      <title>An Earth Encounter As the Cause of Chaotic Dynamics in Binary Asteroid (35107) 1991VH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among binary asteroids, (35107) 1991VH stands out as unique given the likely chaotic rotation within its secondary component. The source of this excited dynamical state is unknown. In this work we demonstrate that a past close encounter with Earth could have provided the necessary perturbation to allow the natural internal dynamics, characterized by spin-orbit coupling, to evolve the system into its current dynamical state. In this hypothesis, the secondary of 1991VH was previously in a classical 1:1 spin-orbit resonance with an orbit period likely between 28-35 hours before being perturbed by an Earth encounter within $\sim80,000$ km. We find if the energy dissipation within the secondary is relatively inefficient, this excited dynamical state could persist to today and produce the observed ground-based measurements. Coupled with the orbital history of 1991VH, we can then place a constraint on the tidal dissipation parameters of the secondary.</description>

      <title>Precise Bolometric Luminosities and Effective Temperatures of 23 late-T and Y dwarfs Obtained with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI LRS spectra covering the $\sim$1--12 $\mu$m wavelength range at $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \approx 100$ and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 $\mu$m. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at $\lambda &lt; 3$ $\mu$m and $\lambda &gt; 8$ $\mu$m, it shows no clear trend in the 5 $\mu$m region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and HST, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from $\sim$1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of $\pm$20 K which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.</description>
