      <title>Long-term decomposition of robust pricing kernels under G-expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a BSDE method for the long-term decomposition of pricing kernels under the G-expectation framework. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to three types of quadratic G-BSDEs: finite-horizon G-BSDEs, infinite-horizon G-BSDEs, and ergodic G-BSDEs. Moreover, we explore the Feynman--Kac formula associated with these three types of quadratic G-BSDEs. Using these results, a pricing kernel is uniquely decomposed into four components: an exponential discounting component, a transitory component, a symmetric G-martingale, and a decreasing component that captures the volatility uncertainty of the G-Brownian motion. Furthermore, these components are represented through a solution to a PDE. This study extends previous findings obtained under a single fixed probability framework to the G-expectation context.</description>

      <title>Irreversible investment under weighted discounting: effects of decreasing impatience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs an intra-personal game-theoretic framework to investigate how decreasing impatience influences irreversible investment behaviors in a continuous-time setting. We consider a capacity expansion problem under weighted discount functions, a class of nonexponential functions that exhibit decreasing impatience, including the hyperbolic discount function as a special case. By deriving the Bellman system that characterizes the equilibrium, we establish the framework for analyzing investment behaviors of agents subject to decreasing impatience. From an economic perspective, we demonstrates that decreasing impatience prompts early investment. From a technical standpoint, we warn that decreasing impatience can lead to the failure of the smooth pasting principle.</description>

      <title>Risk-indifference Pricing of American-style Contingent Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing of contingent claims of American style, using indifference pricing by fully dynamic convex risk measures. We provide a general definition of risk-indifference prices for buyers and sellers in continuous time, in a setting where buyer and seller have potentially different information, and show that these definitions are consistent with no-arbitrage principles. Specifying to stochastic volatility models, we characterize indifference prices via solutions of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations reflected at Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and show that this characterization provides a basis for the implementation of numerical methods using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Criteria for the absence of arbitrage in general diffusion markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish deterministic necessary and sufficient conditions for the no-arbitrage notions NA ("no arbitrage"), NUPBR ("no unbounded profit with bounded risk") and NFLVR ("no free lunch with vanishing risk") in general diffusion market models with finite and infinite time horizons. These are single asset models whose (discounted) asset price process $Y$ is a regular continuous strong Markov process that is also a semimartingale. We further characterize the existence of an equivalent martingale measure in such models. All deterministic criteria are provided in terms of the scale function and the speed measure of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Joint Calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>
