      <title>Joint analysis of small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing from BOSS galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy--galaxy lensing measurements from BOSS galaxies using a simulation-based emulation method combined with a halo occupation distribution model. Our emulators are constructed with the Aemulus $\nu$ simulations, a suite of $w\nu$CDM $N$-body simulations with massive neutrinos as independent particle species. We combine small-scale analysis of clustering from $0.1h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc and lensing from $1.7h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc to perform cosmological constraints. We split the BOSS galaxies into three redshift bins to measure their clustering and employ galaxies from Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam as source galaxies to measure lensing separately. We find that the addition of lensing significantly improves the constraining power on $S_{8}=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$, with a weak improvement for $f\sigma_{8}$. Our results of $f\sigma_{8}$ indicate tensions of around $1\sim4\sigma$ below the results of CMB observations of Planck. For $S_{8}$, our results are also lower than Planck, and the tension can be mitigated when considering possible systematics in lensing measurement. As a byproduct, our analysis prefers a non-zero neutrino mass but without strong significance, with the constraining power dominated by the clustering. Given the accuracy and precision of our model and the observational data, it is anticipated that larger and higher-quality spectroscopic datasets will improve the constraints on this fundamental property in the near future.</description>

      <title>Tracing cosmic structure with neutral hydrogen after the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the transition of Neutral Hydrogen (HI) gas from the end of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) to late-time large-scale structure. We examine the signature of the transition as traced through the redshifted 21-cm line with SKA-Low at $3 &lt; z &lt; 7$. To do so, we use the semi-numerical simulation \textsc{21cmFAST} to model the HI during the EoR and add a HI-halo based post-processing model of the late-time HI. This approach gives a robust estimate of the amplitude of the HI temperature field and predicts the observable power spectrum during the transition period. We find that our simulation pipeline reproduces the expected power spectrum trends from existing observations and theory, in addition to replicating current observational constraints on $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$. Our simulations predict a drop in power of four orders of magnitude between $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Assuming an inhomogeneous recombination model, we find a flattening of the power due to lingering neutral islands masking the late-time HI signal for $5 &lt; z&lt; 6.5$. Using SKA-Low deep survey parameters, we find HI power spectrum detectability at scales $k \leq 1$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for redshifts $3&lt; z &lt; 7$, even when using the horizon limit to mitigate foregrounds. Our results suggest a sufficient SNR of the HI power spectrum tracing the underlying halos $z &lt; 5$, which can be used for late-time cosmology. Our results suggest that the resulting $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints can trace different reionization scenarios such as a decreased escape fraction. This study implies that deep SKA-Low observations for $3&lt; z&lt; 7$ will be an important probe to constrain reionization parameters as well as cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Was the Early Universe Quantum? Falsifying Classical Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary cosmology successfully accounts for the observed properties of primordial fluctuations using quantum field theory in an expanding background. However, the quantum nature of these fluctuations has not been experimentally established, since classical stochastic models could reproduce the observed two-point statistics by construction. Existing approaches to testing primordial quantumness focus primarily on Bell inequalities, which provide a sharp conceptual criterion but are difficult to implement with cosmological observables. In this work we adopt a falsification-based approach. We define a precise classical hypothesis for the origin of primordial perturbations (local stochastic fields admitting a positive probability distribution) and identify inequality constraints that must be satisfied within this class. We show how violations of these classicality inequalities can be probed using realistic cosmological observables, without invoking Bell tests or non-commuting measurement settings. We further identify symmetry-protected spectator sectors in which quantum coherence is parametrically preserved during inflation, allowing violations of observable magnitude to survive decoherence. Our results show that large-scale structure and future 21 cm surveys provide a viable and quantitative route to falsifying classical stochastic descriptions of primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>An efficient model of cosmology dependence in the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance matrices are essential cosmological probes of fundamental physics, providing information on numerous fundamental physical parameters and varying with any change in the underlying cosmology. However, this cosmology dependence, while providing excellent information, also makes them computationally intensive to compute, as a new covariance matrix must explicitly be calculated for every variation in cosmology before comparisons to observational data can be made. In this paper, we develop an efficient model for estimating the parameter dependence of the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum by Taylor expanding around a known value of the parameter space. This method allows us to use a relatively small number of input cosmologies, specifically one fiducial cosmology and two further cosmologies for each parameter. We explicitly calculate the covariance matrices for these cosmologies and then develop a new model that allows us to interpolate from these the form of the covariance matrix with a cosmology that is located elsewhere in that given parameter space without explicit perturbation theory calculations. This method speeds up covariance matrix calculations in new cosmologies by orders of magnitude compared to explicit perturbation theory calculations at each point in a given parameter space. Using different approximations, we develop three versions of our interpolated covariance matrix and validate the model by recreating all of our input cosmologies using all three forms, both with and without super-sample covariance corrections in each case, and show that the models provide robust recreations of the original results, with the different approximations being valid in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tracer Cross-Correlations of the Unresolved $\gamma$-Ray Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $\gamma$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $\gamma$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved {\gamma}-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $\gamma$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</description>

      <title>Combined LOFAR-uGMRT analysis of the diffuse radio emission in the massive clusters Abell 773 and Abell 1351</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse, non-thermal radio sources located at the centers of galaxy clusters, tracing relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the intra-cluster medium. Their origin is generally attributed to cluster mergers that generate turbulence and re-accelerate aged electrons. We study the diffuse radio emission, spectral properties, and the connection between thermal and non-thermal components in the massive galaxy clusters Abell 773 and Abell 1351 ($M_{500} \sim 7 \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$), both of which are dynamically disturbed. We combine LOFAR LoTSS-DR2 observations at 144 MHz with uGMRT observations at 650 MHz, supplemented by archival XMM-Newton X-ray imaging. We confirm that both clusters host radio halos extending up to a largest linear size of $\sim 2$ Mpc. We measure an integrated spectral index $\alpha_{144}^{650} \sim -1.0$ for both clusters. The radio halo in Abell 773 resembles a classical halo and follows a sublinear radio--X-ray surface brightness relation. In contrast, Abell 1351 shows a more complex and asymmetric morphology, influenced by embedded radio sources including the brightest cluster galaxy, a tailed radio galaxy, and a ridge-like feature. These contaminating sources lead to deviations from the sublinear trend in the point-to-point radio--X-ray analysis of Abell 1351.</description>

      <title>MIU2Net: weak-lensing mass inversion using deep learning with nested U-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary goals of next-generation gravitational lensing surveys is to measure the large-scale distribution of dark matter, which requires accurate mass inversion to convert weak-lensing shear maps into convergence (kappa) fields. This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale. MIU2Net represents a substantial advancement in mass inversion methodology, offering improved accuracy in both RMSE and power-spectrum reconstruction. It provides a promising tool for mapping dark matter environments and large-scale structures in the era of next-generation space lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Joint constraints on cosmic birefringence and early dark energy from ACT, Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing number of high-precision astronomical observations, physical quantities that were previously inaccessible to accurate calculations, such as cosmic birefringence, have once again become a focal point of interest. Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$. By comparing the cosmological evolution of this model across different data combinations, we find that the ACT-$EB$ data combined with {Planck} + DESI + PantheonPlus provide good constraints to both early- and late-Universe observations.</description>

      <title>Still Accelerating: Type Ia supernova cosmology is robust to host galaxy age evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are a cornerstone of modern cosmology, providing first evidence for cosmic acceleration and new tests of dark energy. Son et al. 2025 (S25) claim a strong redshift evolution in standardized supernova luminosities driven by supernova progenitor age, with dramatic cosmological implications: rapidly evolving dark energy, decelerating expansion, and a $9\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda$CDM. We show that the underpinning evidence required for this conclusion -- the supernova progenitor-age dependence, the redshift-dependent age difference, and their combined impact -- is either negligible or relies on effects already corrected for in modern supernova analyses. First, the S25 analysis omits the standard host-galaxy stellar mass correction that captures known environmental dependencies that also correlate with stellar age. Applying this correction to the S25 sample, we find no dependence of standardized supernova brightness on host age. Independent data also show no significant difference at low-redshift in standardized brightness between star-forming galaxies and several Gyr older quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Second, the S25 scenario predicts strong redshift evolution of the host-mass effect. Data from the Dark Energy Survey supernova survey measure evolution of $-0.028 \pm 0.034~\mathrm{mag}\,z^{-1}$, consistent with zero and altering the dark-energy equation-of-state measurement ($w$) by $&lt;$0.01 if included. Third, we demonstrate that the claimed $\sim5$~Gyr progenitor age difference between nearby and distant supernovae is overstated by factors of three to five largely due to a conflation of host galaxy age with supernova progenitor age. We conclude that type~Ia supernova cosmology remains robust for current measurements of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Tracing Cosmological Signature with Doppler Lensing: Insights from Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler lensing, a relativistic effect resulting from the peculiar velocities of galaxies along the line of sight, provides insight into the large-scale structure of the Universe. Relativistic simulations are essential for modeling Doppler lensing because they incorporate gravity and motion in spacetime. We compare two relativistic $N$-body simulation frameworks, $\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ and $\texttt{SCREENING}$, to calculate Doppler lensing convergence in cosmic voids of different sizes and halos of different masses. Our analysis reveals scale-dependent performance: $\texttt{SCREENING}$ shows larger differences in small voids (radius range: 15--25 Mpc/h) with a mean absolute relative difference of 38.5\%, due to linearized dynamics failing in nonlinear regimes. Medium voids (25--35 Mpc/h) show better agreement (9.5\% mean difference). For large voids (35--45 Mpc/h), $\texttt{SCREENING}$ exhibits intermediate differences (16.9\% mean difference) with central instabilities. Moreover, our Doppler convergence analysis with massive halos ($10^{11.5}$--$10^{14} {~h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot}$) demonstrates excellent consistency (1.6--3.6\% mean difference). These findings provide clear guidance for simulation choice: $\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ is recommended for precision studies critical to $\Lambda$CDM or modified gravity tests, while $\texttt{SCREENING}$ offers a computationally efficient alternative for relativistic treatments with large catalogs of voids and halos, assisting future astrophysical surveys.</description>

      <title>Examination of frequency and scale dependence of CMB hemispherical power asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the well-known cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomaly referred to as Hemispherical Power Asymmetry (HPA), using CMB temperature maps from the Planck mission public release 4 (PR4) and the WMAP nine-year data release. Employing the Local Variance Estimator (LVE) method, we systematically reexamine the properties of HPA to investigate possible frequency dependence as well as scale dependence in its amplitude and direction. We model the HPA as a scale-dependent dipole modulation following a power-law form, rather than assuming a scale-invariant case.
  Our analysis incorporates seven cleaned frequency-specific CMB temperature maps from both the Planck and WMAP missions to test the robustness of the observed asymmetry across instruments and frequency channels. We find that the dipolar modulation characteristic of HPA is present in all cases examined, with consistent estimates of the preferred direction and scale-dependent variation in dipole amplitudes. These results support the conclusion that the observed asymmetry is unlikely to arise from instrumental artifacts or data-processing effects, and instead points toward a persistent large-scale feature of the CMB sky with a possible cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>Frequency shift and viewing direction variations in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a gravitational lensing system, the relative transverse velocities of the lens, source, and observer induce a frequency shift in the observed radiation. While this shift is typically negligible in most astrophysical contexts, strategies for its detection have been proposed for both electromagnetic and gravitational waves. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical treatment of the effect, deriving general expressions for the frequency shift within a lensing system embedded in a cosmological spacetime. Our formulation remains valid for arbitrary distances and velocities - including highly relativistic regimes - under any Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric.
  Expanding upon previous papers on moving lenses, we provide a detailed analysis of frequency effects induced by lenses moving at relativistic speeds. Furthermore, we extend standard lensing theory by deriving an exact formula for the variation in the source's viewing direction. This result is of interest for strongly anisotropic emitters, such as compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves. Finally, we quantify the apparent misalignment between the lens and the source's two images produced by time-delay effects in lens systems moving with high velocity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers provided for usage in cloud by big companies (such as IBM, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, etc.) to run our quantum neural network (QNN) developed for data analysis in the context of LISA Space Mission, developed with the Qiskit library in Python. Our previous work demonstrated that our QNN learns patterns in gravitational wave (GW) data much faster than a classical neural network, making it suitable for fast GW signal detection in future LISA data streams. Analyzing the fees from hardware providers like IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure, we found that the fees for running the first segment of our QNN sum up to \$2000, \$60000, and \$1000000 respectively. Using free plans, we succeed to run the 3-qubit feature map of the QNN for one random data sample on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont IQM Quantum Computers\_Garnet} quantum computers, obtaining a fidelity of 99\%; we could also run the first prediction segment of our QNN on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto}, implemented for 4 qubits, and obtained a prediction accuracy of 20\%. We queried providers such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Pasqal, and Munich Quantum Valley to obtain access to their plans, but, with the exception of Amazon Braket, our applications remain unanswered to this day. Other major setbacks in using the quantum computers we had access to included Qiskit library version issues (as in the cases of IBM Quantum and IQM Quantum Computers) and the frequent unavailability of the devices, as was the case with the Microsoft Azure provider. All the results presented in this paper were accumulated in 2024.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Matter Creation Process: Observational Constraints on Gravitationally Induced Dark Energy and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent Hubble tension and the lack of a fundamental explanation for dark energy motivate the exploration of alternative mechanisms capable of reproducing late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we revisit gravitationally induced particle creation as a phenomenological non-equilibrium process that can effectively mimic a dynamical dark-energy component. Within the thermodynamic framework of open systems, we model the production of an unspecified particle species with constant intrinsic equation-of-state parameter and consider four phenomenological parametrisations of the particle-creation rate. The modified continuity and Friedmann equations lead to an effective negative pressure and a redshift-dependent effective equation of state, which we constrain using Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO, a compressed CMB likelihood, and SH0ES data. Using the full dataset combination, we find that particle-creation models provide fits comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, yielding $H_0 \simeq 69.3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and present-day effective dark-energy equation-of-state values close to $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm DE}(0)\simeq -1$, with all models predicting an accelerating Universe ($q_0\simeq -0.55$). When the Hubble tension is assessed using early- and late-time dataset splits, particle-creation scenarios reduce its statistical significance to the $\simeq 2.4\sigma$--$3\sigma$ level, compared to the $4.3\sigma$ discrepancy obtained in $\Lambda$CDM. Although deviations from $\Lambda$CDM remain mild and Bayesian model comparison indicates no statistical preference between models, gravitationally induced particle creation emerges as a viable late-time extension of the standard cosmological model and provides a consistent phenomenological framework for exploring departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of large-scale, adiabatic inflationary perturbations from enhanced small-scale modes at one-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider back-reaction from large amplitude, short-scale perturbations onto a long wavelength adiabatic mode. In a loop expansion of the long-mode power spectrum, this back-reaction appears first at 1-loop. Due to the separation between the long and short scales, the separate universe method provides a simple and efficient framework for this computation. In this paper, building on our earlier work, we employ a $\delta N$ formula for the long mode, which captures the effect of short scales. We show that back-reaction at 1-loop is due to either (i) non-linearity of the $\delta N$ formula, or (ii) 1-loop corrections to the initial conditions. We argue that contributions of type (ii) cannot themselves be described within the separate universe framework, but their properties can be constrained using soft theorems and a ''multi-point propagator'' expansion. When applied to a band of enhanced short-scale perturbations that crossed the horizon during inflation, our result shows that the loop correction decouples from their detailed properties. Furthermore, the back-reaction we obtain is scale-invariant. Its magnitude is model-dependent, but is degenerate with effects from modes that were still sub-horizon at the end of inflation. In this scenario (but not necessarily in all scenarios), we conclude that the effect is not observable.</description>

      <title>Probing super-heavy dark matter with ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the constraints on the lifetime of decaying super-heavy dark matter particles (SHDM), with masses ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$ GeV, by analyzing ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray data. Our approach involves an accurate comparison of the primary gamma-ray emissions resulting from prompt SHDM decays in the galactic halo with the most recent upper limits on isotropic UHE gamma-ray fluxes provided by various extensive air shower experiments. We demonstrate that a precise consideration of the field of view and the geometric acceptance of different UHE gamma-ray observatories has significant implications for the inferred limits of dark matter lifetime. In addition, we examine the influence of uncertainties linked to the current models of the galactic dark matter distribution, employing diverse halo density profiles while varying both their radial extent and the local dark matter density. Our findings indicate that the newly established UHE gamma-ray constraints are marginally less stringent than earlier evaluations, thereby revisiting the SHDM parameter space and allowing for observable neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Hedorah, the first yellow supergiant Kaiju star candidate at $z\approx3$ revealed by behind AS1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new free-form lens model for the $z=0.348$ galaxy cluster AS1063, based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new images from the GLIMPSE program. We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\approx 4\, \mu$m that likely corresponds to H$-\beta$ and/or OIII at $z\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it "Hedorah", in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z&gt;0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage.</description>

      <title>Forbidden dark matter assisted by first-order phase transition and associated gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple yet testable framework for light fermion dark matter (DM) with mass in the MeV--GeV range, charged under a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The $U(1)_D$ is spontaneously broken by a scalar field $\Phi$, giving mass to the dark gauge boson $X_D$. The dominant DM annihilation proceeds via a forbidden channel, where the DM pair annihilates into slightly heavier dark gauge bosons and scalars after the dark-sector phase transition. Once the dark-sector phase transition occurs, the induced mass gap activates the forbidden annihilation channel, which in turn determines the DM relic abundance and naturally suppresses late-time annihilation. As a result, the scenario avoids stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints that typically exclude thermal light DM. Moreover, the same symmetry-breaking phase transition is strongly first-order, producing a stochastic gravitational wave background that could be probed by upcoming space-based interferometers and pulsar timing arrays. We demonstrate that achieving the observed DM abundance tightly correlates the DM mass with the nucleation temperature of the phase transition. Thus, this setup links the DM relic abundance, dark-sector dynamics, and gravitational wave signals, offering complementary paths for discovery in both terrestrial and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $^7$Be Weak and Radiative Transition Rates in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Implications for the Primordial Lithium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li.</description>

      <title>Baryon-dark matter coincidence in Randall-Sundrum Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the extra-dimensional Randall-Sundrum set-up, we investigate the freeze-in production of Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet scalar, fermionic, and massive vector dark matter (DM). Assuming that both the DM and SM fields reside on the IR brane and interact solely through the graviton and radion, we demonstrate that the observed DM relic abundance measured by Planck can be achieved across a wide range of reheating temperatures, all while naturally addressing the hierarchy problem, satisfying constraints from collider, early Universe cosmology including $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$. We further show that the same set-up can accommodate TeV-scale leptogenesis capable of generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Remarkably, we find that current graviton searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) already impose strong constraints on the reheating temperature in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Mass density structuring around galaxy formation sites: impact on galaxy basic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local evolution of the Universe around galaxy formation sites in the EAGLE50 large-volume reference simulation. Using the reduced inertia tensor (r-TOI), we followed the anisotropic evolution of initially spherical Lagrangian volumes (LVs) centred at galaxy formation sites, both in dark matter (DM) and in cold baryons (CB), from very high redshift $z=15$ onward. We describe LV deformation in terms of the r-TOI eigen-directions, principal axes, their derived shape parameters, and the timescales for the freezing-out of these principal directions and axes. Of particular interest are the age of the Universe, $t_{\rm U}$, when the local Cosmic Web (CW) spine emerges, and that when anisotropic DM mass arrangements (i.e., migrant mass flows) cease. We find that the shapes LVs acquire along their evolution affect the halo and stellar mass of their central galaxy: prolate-shaped LVs show a tendency to host low-mass galaxies at $z=0$, while massive galaxies tend to form within triaxial or oblate LVs. Also, the local CW spine tends to set in earlier on in LVs that are to host massive galaxies than in those harbouring less massive galaxies. In addition, anisotropic DM-mass rearrangements stop late on average, at $t_{\rm U}\sim 10.5\,$Gyr, and even slightly later for CB. Interestingly, $z=0$ LVs with either flattened configurations in CB or those that are highly prolate in DM, are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies. This effect increases from $z=1$ to $z=0$. Finally, the CB spine of LVs that are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies emerges at later times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift 1.98 galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) from the core of the cluster out to 3 Mpc, a scale equivalent to 10 times the R500 = 295 kpc radius. We present an expanded photometric and spectroscopic catalogue of the cluster, bringing the total number of spectroscopically classified member galaxies to 74, with 35 new member galaxies added in the outer regions of the cluster. We compute the radial galaxy number density profile in the cluster, and observe no clear evidence of infalling groups or cosmic filaments. We observe a clear bimodal colour relation in member galaxies, with red fraction increasing towards the cluster centre. This rapid increase of red fraction upon infall is indicative of a fast quenching mechanism, such as ram pressure stripping, as galaxies enter the cluster centre. We fit a luminosity function to the cluster members, finding a similar low mass slope but fainter scale magnitude than z = 1 clusters of similar temperature, implying a similar galaxy evolution rate to clusters at lower redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the standard framework in which electroweak sphaleron processes relate lepton and baryon number, we derive an upper limit on the amplitude of a chiral gravitational wave background produced prior to the electroweak epoch. This bound is independent of the production time of chiral GWs for superhorizon modes, while it becomes sensitive to the production time for subhorizon modes. For sufficiently high reheating temperatures, the bound becomes significantly more stringent than the conventional big bang nucleosynthesis constraints at frequencies above the MHz scale, thereby providing a powerful and \emph{model-independent} probe of parity-violating physics in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Opportunities in AI/ML for the Rubin LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.</description>

Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) of emission from star-forming galaxies can be used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale as far back as the epoch of reionization. This provides a standard cosmic ruler to constrain the expansion rate of the Universe at redshifts which cannot be directly probed otherwise. In light of growing tension between measurements of the current expansion rate using the local distance ladder and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background, extending the constraints on the expansion history to bridge between the late and early Universe is of paramount importance. Using a newly derived methodology to robustly extract cosmological information from LIM, which minimizes the inherent degeneracy with unknown astrophysics, we show that present and future experiments can gradually improve the measurement precision of the expansion rate history, ultimately reaching percent-level constraints on the BAO scale. Specifically, we provide detailed forecasts for the SPHEREx satellite, which will target the H$\alpha$ and Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, and for the ground-based COMAP instrument -- as well as a future stage-3 experiment -- that will target the CO rotational lines. Besides weighing in on the so-called Hubble tension, reliable LIM cosmic rulers can enable wide-ranging tests of dark matter, dark energy and modified gravity.</description>

Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) provides a promising way to probe cosmology, reionization and galaxy evolution. However, its sensitivity to cosmology and astrophysics at the same time is also a nuisance. Here we develop a comprehensive framework for modelling the LIM power spectrum, which includes redshift space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. We then identify and isolate degeneracies with astrophysics so that they can be marginalized over. We study the gains of using the multipole expansion of the anisotropic power spectrum, providing an accurate analytic expression for their covariance, and find a 10%-60% increase in the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale measurements when including the hexadecapole in the analysis. We discuss different observational strategies when targeting other cosmological parameters, such as the sum of neutrino masses or primordial non-Gaussianity, finding that fewer and wider bins are typically more optimal. Overall, our formalism facilitates an optimal extraction of cosmological constraints robust to astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light (ZL) model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is inspired by the original DIRBE model by Kelsall et al. (K98), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 3\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 ZL Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 30$ kJy/sr at 1.25--3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, the total RMS of each DR2 map is lower than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA map of $\sim$ 80 \% at wavelengths 4.9--25 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.

      <title>The non-linear dynamics of axion inflation: a detailed lattice study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the fully inhomogeneous non-linear dynamics of axion inflation, identifying three regimes: weak-, mild-, and strong-backreaction, depending on the duration of inflation. We use lattice techniques that explicitly preserve gauge invariance and shift symmetry, and which we validate against other computational methods of the linear dynamics and of the homogeneous backreaction regime. Notably, we demonstrate that the latter fails to accurately describe the truly local dynamics of strong backreaction. We investigate the convergence of simulations of local backreaction, determining the requirements to achieve an accurate description of the dynamics, and providing useful parametrizations of the delay of the end of inflation. Additionally, we identify key features emerging from a proper local treatment of strong backreaction: the dominance of magnetic energy against the electric counterpart, the excitation of the longitudinal mode, and the generation of a scale-dependent chiral (im)balance. Our results underscore the necessity to accurately capture the local nature of the non-linear dynamics of the system, in order to correctly assess phenomenological predictions, such as e.g. the production of gravitational waves and primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee cosmology: Tests using distance- and time-redshift probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern cosmology, the discovery of the universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae calibrated via the SH0ES (Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State) Cepheid distance ladder analysis and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), as well as recently included cosmic chronometers (CC) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee models and compare them with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the bumblebee theory on its own can provide sufficiently good fits to the current observational data of distance- and time-redshift relations, suggesting its potential to explain the cosmic background dynamics. However, when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the latter still outperforms the former according to the information criteria. We propose that further constraints from cosmological perturbation tests could impose more stringent constraints on bumblebee cosmology.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure, offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we present the first full-sky computation of the angular bispectrum in second-order perturbation theory without invoking the Limber approximation, and formulated for finite redshift bins via window functions. To our knowledge, even the Newtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include, up to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic and radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection effects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated contributions, however note that in particular the former can be straightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum contributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \leq z \leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \leq z \leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic light-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to enable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian contributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the relativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we find that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable amplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects dominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the expected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain non-negligible -- only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects. Our theoretical results agree fairly well with simulation measurements for the total bispectrum. To facilitate future applications and reproducibility, we make the corresponding code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Orbiting and Infalling Dark Matter Particles with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter halos are typically defined as spheres that enclose some overdensity, but these sharp, somewhat arbitrary boundaries introduce non-physical artifacts such as backsplash halos, pseudo-evolution, and an incomplete accounting of halo mass. A more physically motivated alternative is to define halos as the collection of particles that are physically orbiting within their potential well. However, existing methods to classify particles as orbiting or infalling suffer from trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalizability across cosmologies. We present an efficient, yet accurate, supervised machine learning approach using decision trees. The classification is based on only the particle radii and velocities at two epochs. Compared to detailed analysis of particle trajectories, we find that our model matches the classification of 97\% of particles. Consequently, we are able to quickly and accurately reproduce the density profiles of the orbiting and infalling components out to many virial radii. We demonstrate that our model generalizes to a significantly different cosmology that lies outside the training dataset. We make publicly available both our final model and the code to train similar models.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <title>Euclid: An emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,\mathrm{i}h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics. These results demonstrate that our emulator meets the high-precision requirements of the Euclid mission for at least the first data release and provides reliable forecasts of the cosmological information contained in the small-scale matter bispectrum. This underscores the potential of emulation techniques to bridge the gap between complex baryonic physics and observational data, maximising the scientific output of Euclid.</description>

      <title>On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension "no-go theorem", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</description>

      <title>Cavendish experiment with fast radio bursts on cosmological scales</title>

Abstract: A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\Psi+\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\delta_m$, encapsulated as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, along with possible spatial and temporal variations, is essential for probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the absence of an unbiased proxy for $\delta_m$ prevents the direct measurement of $G_{\rm light}$. In this letter, we point out that the equivalence principle guarantees the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy for $\delta_m$. We further propose an FRB-based estimator $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. With a conservative cut $k\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, the measurement can achieve a precision of $\lesssim 10\% \sqrt{10^5/N_{\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, remains subdominant at the $5\%$ level. It can be further mitigated to the $\lesssim 1\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the clustering bias of total baryons (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning 20 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Limits of self-interacting neutrinos from the BAO and CMB phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos with Standard Model interactions free-stream in the early Universe, leaving a distinct phase shift in the pattern of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.</description>

      <title>Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. To constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods and investigate the sensitivity of APPA using two complementary approaches: Likelihood analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for the axion mass range of $10^{-22}-10^{-18}$ eV, APPA yields a tighter upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations, while also achieving superior detection sensitivity. Moreover, a larger spatial distribution scale of the satellite network corresponds to a greater advantage in detecting axions with lighter masses.</description>

      <title>Absorption effects in the expanding Universe: spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium for distant sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the formation of broad absorption troughs in the spectra of high-redshift sources in the redshift range $5\le z\le15$ for two observationally motivated reionization histories inferred from distant galaxy spectra and CMB polarization measurements. We assume that neutral hydrogen and helium in a homogeneous intergalactic medium are predominantly in their ground states and absorb radiation from distant sources through the Lyman-series lines and continua of HI, HeI, and HeII. We compute the wavelength-dependent optical depths in the first 40 Lyman-series lines of HI and HeII, in the first 10 Lyman-series lines of HeI, as well as in the corresponding Lyman continua, and use them to derive spectral transmittance functions of the intergalactic medium, $S(\lambda;z)$. We show that spectral features in the continuous spectra of sources at $5\lesssim z\lesssim7$ are particularly sensitive to the reionization histories of both hydrogen and helium. We present a compact analytic prescription for the effective intergalactic spectral transmittance caused by hydrogen and helium absorption over the redshift range $0\le z\le15$. The formalism provides closed-form expressions for the wavelength-dependent transmission of the intergalactic medium, including the Lyman-series transitions and continua of HI, HeI, and HeII, calibrated to observationally constrained reionization histories.</description>

      <title>The art of simulating the early Universe. Part II. Non-canonical cases &amp; gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: We present a discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of non-canonical field theory circumstances, complementing our previous monograph (arXiv:2006.15122) on canonical cases. We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primordial Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3$--$10^4$.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: WIMP dark matter constraints from the cross-correlation of weak lensing and Fermi-LAT gamma rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter dominates the matter content of the Universe, and its properties can be constrained through large-scale structure probes such as the cross-correlation between the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) and weak gravitational lensing. We analysed 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, constructing UGRB intensity maps in ten energy bins (0.5-1000 GeV), and cross-correlated them with KiDS-Legacy shear in six tomographic bins. The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found. Based on this non-detection, we present 95% upper bounds on the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) decay rate $\Gamma_{\rm dec}$ and velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section $\langle\sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle$ as functions of mass. We compare our results with bounds from other cosmological tracers and from local probes, and found them to be complementary, particularly at low masses ($\rm GeV/TeV$). In addition, using a Euclid-like lensing survey cross-correlated with Fermi-LAT, we forecast $\sim$2 times tighter limits, highlighting the potential of forthcoming data to strengthen constraints on dark matter annihilation and decay.</description>

Abstract: The Generalized Cosmological Time (GCT) framework offers an alternative phenomenological approach to addressing the Hubble tension and the observed time dilation of Type Ia supernovae, characterized by a background parameter b \simeq 0.04 and an associated cosmological scaling of fundamental constants. A key conceptual question is whether such a background evolution is compatible with the stability of local, gravitationally bound systems, in particular black holes. This work examines black hole thermodynamics within the GCT framework, focusing on the geometric compatibility between a locally static region and a time-dependent cosmological background. By matching a static interior spacetime to a GCT-FLRW exterior across a timelike boundary, it is shown that the Israel junction conditions allow for the coexistence of distinct time normalizations without introducing surface stresses. In this setting, the local interior naturally admits a unit lapse function, while the background evolution is encoded in the cosmological time gauge. The resulting separation of time normalizations implies that the effective GCT parameter governing local physics is observationally indistinguishable from b_{\mathrm{local}} \simeq 0. Under this geometric shielding, black hole thermodynamics reduces to its standard general relativistic form, and the Generalized Second Law is satisfied without imposing additional constraints on the background parameter b. These results indicate that the empirical stability of black hole thermodynamics does not directly constrain the global GCT evolution but instead reflects a geometric decoupling between local and cosmological time gauges. Black hole stability thus emerges as a consistency condition for geometric shielding, rather than as independent evidence for or against the underlying cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We put into test the idea of replacing dark energy by a vector field against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation using the simplest vector-tensor theory, where a massive vector field couples to the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor quadratically. First, a remarkable Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric solution that is completely independent of the matter-energy compositions of the universe is found. Second, based on the FLRW solution as well as the perturbation equations, a numerical code calculating the CMB temperature power spectrum is built. We find that though the FLRW solution can mimic the evolution of the universe in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the calculated CMB temperature power spectrum shows unavoidable discrepancies from the CMB power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization Are All Bark and No Bite -- Plenty of Ionizing Photons, Low Escape Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using \jwst\ imaging and prism spectroscopy for 412 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar-population and nebular-emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, $f_\mathrm{esc}$. We find that the ionization production efficiency, $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, $\sigma( \log \xi_\mathrm{ion})$ = 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are low, ranging from $\langle f_\mathrm{esc} \rangle$ = $2.6\pm 1.4$\% at 6 &lt; z &lt; 9 to $6.5\pm 2.2$\% at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 with weak or no indication of evolution with redshift. This implies that in our models most of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ and $f_\mathrm{esc}$, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of $x_e = 0.5$ at 5.3 &lt; z &lt; 5.8, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain $x_e = 0.5$ at 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 8.1, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\times 10^{-3}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it \emph{appears} to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. However, the full inferred population of compact binaries may be more informative of the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with deep ensembles: Evaluating calibration uncertainty and detecting model misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmologies in modified gravity with space time torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions. Constraints on the model parameters have also been derived based on cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Implications of $f(R)$ gravity on late-time cosmic structure growth through a complete description of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of $\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the quasistatic approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We finally extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content to also obtain conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent flux backgrounds in type IIB supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nu\~nez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.</description>

      <title>From the Wavefunction of the Universe to In-In-Correlators: A Perturbative Map to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of cosmological perturbations: The residual low-multipole ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.</description>
