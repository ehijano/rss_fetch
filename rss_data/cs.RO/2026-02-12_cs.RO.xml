      <title>Adaptive Time Step Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reasoning about interactions with surrounding traffic. A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

      <title>A Human-in-the-Loop Confidence-Aware Failure Recovery Framework for Modular Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

      <title>Solving Geodesic Equations with Composite Bernstein Polynomials for Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.</description>

      <title>LocoVLM: Grounding Vision and Language for Adapting Versatile Legged Locomotion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in legged locomotion learning are still dominated by the utilization of geometric representations of the environment, limiting the robot's capability to respond to higher-level semantics such as human instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates high-level commonsense reasoning from foundation models into the process of legged locomotion adaptation. Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.</description>

      <title>Towards Long-Lived Robots: Continual Learning VLA Models via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained on large-scale and diverse datasets, VLA models demonstrate strong generalization and adaptability as general-purpose robotic policies. However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs.</description>

      <title>Co-jump: Cooperative Jumping with Quadrupedal Robots via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>ReSPEC: A Framework for Online Multispectral Sensor Reconfiguration in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\% with only a 5.3\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline. These results highlight the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>LAP: Language-Action Pre-Training Enables Zero-shot Cross-Embodiment Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</description>

      <title>Morphogenetic Assembly and Adaptive Control for Heterogeneous Modular Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.</description>

      <title>Flow-Enabled Generalization to Human Demonstrations in Few-Shot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.</description>

      <title>Pitch Angle Control of a Magnetically Actuated Capsule Robot with Nonlinear FEA-based MPC and EKF Multisensory Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically actuated capsule robots promise minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but existing systems largely neglect control of capsule pitch, a degree of freedom critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls. This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.</description>

Abstract: Intra-vehicular free-flying robots are anticipated to support various work in human spaceflight while working side-by-side with astronauts. Such example of robots includes NASA's Astrobee, DLR's CIMON, and JAXA's Int-Ball, which are deployed on the International Space Station. This paper presents the first joint analyses of these robot's shared experiences, co-authored by their development and operation team members. Despite the different origins and design philosophies, the development and operations of these platforms encountered various convergences. Hence, this paper presents a detailed overview of these robots, presenting their objectives, design, and onboard operations. Hence, joint lessons learned across the lifecycle are presented, from design to on-orbit operations.

      <title>3D-Printed Anisotropic Soft Magnetic Coating for Directional Rolling of a Magnetically Actuated Capsule Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.</description>

Abstract: The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Dual-Arm Aerial Manipulator with Proprioceptive Contact Localization for Landing on Slanted Roofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.</description>

      <title>Say, Dream, and Act: Learning Video World Models for Instruction-Driven Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes &amp; Models will be released.</description>

      <title>From Representational Complementarity to Dual Systems: Synergizing VLM and Vision-Only Backbones for End-to-End Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development and experimental verification of a biomimetic manta ray robot for underwater autonomous exploration. Inspired by manta rays, the robot uses flapping motion for propulsion to minimize seabed disturbance and enhance efficiency compared to traditional screw propulsion. The robot features pectoral fins driven by servo motors and a streamlined control box to reduce fluid resistance. The control system, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B, includes an IMU and pressure sensor for real-time monitoring and control. Experiments in a pool assessed the robot's swimming and diving capabilities. Results show stable swimming and diving motions with PD control. The robot is suitable for applications in environments like aquariums and fish nurseries, requiring minimal disturbance and efficient maneuverability. Our findings demonstrate the potential of bio-inspired robotic designs to improve ecological monitoring and underwater exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots offer promising solutions for labor shortages and increased operational efficiency. However, navigating safely and effectively in dynamic environments, particularly crowded areas, remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Design, Development, and Use of Maya Robot as an Assistant for the Therapy/Education of Children with Cancer: a Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value &lt; 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.</description>

      <title>Developing Neural Network-Based Gaze Control Systems for Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Geometric Control for a Canonical Class of Underactuated Aerial Vehicles with Spurious Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, an assumption that breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces naturally induced by control moments. While strategies for such coupled systems have been validated experimentally, a rigorous theoretical certification of their stability is currently missing. This work fills this gap by providing the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces. We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments.</description>

      <title>RADAR: Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Generalization via Real-World Dynamics, Spatial-Physical Intelligence, and Autonomous Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.</description>

      <title>Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

      <title>Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning of Drone Aerobatics by Exploiting Geometric Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics.</description>

Abstract: Developing world models that understand complex physical interactions is essential for advancing robotic planning and simulation.However, existing methods often struggle to accurately model the environment under conditions of data scarcity and complex contact-rich dynamic motion.To address these challenges, we propose ContactGaussian-WM, a differentiable physics-grounded rigid-body world model capable of learning intricate physical laws directly from sparse and contact-rich video sequences.Our framework consists of two core components: (1) a unified Gaussian representation for both visual appearance and collision geometry, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable learning framework that differentiates through a closed-form physics engine to infer physical properties from sparse visual observations.Extensive simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate that ContactGaussian-WM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning complex scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility of our framework in downstream applications, including data synthesis and real-time MPC.</description>

      <title>SQ-CBF: Signed Distance Functions for Numerically Stable Superquadric-Based Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments.</description>

      <title>RISE: Self-Improving Robot Policy with Compositional World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.</description>

      <title>Digging for Data: Experiments in Rock Pile Characterization Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing in Excavation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.</description>

      <title>A receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging scenarios, able to plan motions such as chimney climbing, navigating very narrow passages or crossing large gaps. Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Hierarchical Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning via Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>APEX: Learning Adaptive High-Platform Traversal for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.</description>

      <title>YOR: Your Own Mobile Manipulator for Generalizable Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in robot learning have generated significant interest in capable platforms that may eventually approach human-level competence. This interest, combined with the commoditization of actuators, has propelled growth in low-cost robotic platforms. However, the optimal form factor for mobile manipulation, especially on a budget, remains an open question. We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/</description>

      <title>Transforming Policy-Car Swerving for Mitigating Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Practice-Oriented Jam-Absorption Driving Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves, as a major form of freeway traffic congestion, cause severe and long-lasting adverse effects, including reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs "slow-in" and "fast-out" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy. To promote reproducibility in the transportation domain, we have also open-sourced all the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/gotrafficgo.</description>

      <title>Confounding Robust Continuous Control via Automatic Reward Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward shaping has been applied widely to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents' training. However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective. Code for training our reward shaping functions can be found at https://github.com/mateojuliani/confounding_robust_cont_control.</description>

      <title>RadarEye: Robust Liquid Level Tracking Using mmWave Radar in Robotic Pouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent liquid manipulation in robotic pouring remains challenging for perception systems: specular/refraction effects and lighting variability degrade visual cues, undermining reliable level estimation. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarEye, a real-time mmWave radar signal processing pipeline for robust liquid level estimation and tracking during the whole pouring process. RadarEye integrates (i) a high-resolution range-angle beamforming module for liquid level sensing and (ii) a physics-informed mid-pour tracker that suppresses multipath to maintain lock on the liquid surface despite stream-induced clutter and source container reflections. The pipeline delivers sub-millisecond latency. In real-robot water-pouring experiments, RadarEye achieves a 0.35 cm median absolute height error at 0.62 ms per update, substantially outperforming vision and ultrasound baselines.</description>

      <title>End-to-End LiDAR optimization for 3D point cloud registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR sensors are a key modality for 3D perception, yet they are typically designed independently of downstream tasks such as point cloud registration. Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-driven Dynamic Knowledge Base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) is introduced to develop an ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) at the tactical edge. The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vision-Language Models for Perception in Autonomous Underwater Robotic Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs) operate in challenging underwater environments, including low visibility and harsh water conditions. Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.</description>

      <title>(MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

      <title>From Steering to Pedalling: Do Autonomous Driving VLMs Generalize to Cyclist-Assistive Spatial Perception and Planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Cross-Domain Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

      <title>Towards Learning a Generalizable 3D Scene Representation from 2D Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Variational Integrator for the Geometrically Exact Rod with Circular Cross-Section Incorporating Cross-Sectional Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the continuous space-time equations of motion of a three-dimensional geometrically exact rod, or the Cosserat rod, incorporating planar cross-sectional deformation. We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by &gt;2.6x and fusion-delay variations by &gt;2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Trajectory Optimization for Bearing-Only Localization in GPS Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization of maritime targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging in GPS-denied environments. UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.</description>

      <title>Min-Sum Uniform Coverage Problem by Autonomous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem for a swarm of $n$ mobile robots on a given finite line segment and on a circle having finite positive radius, where the circle is given as an input. The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \textbf{line-segment setting}, the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost. For the circle setting, we characterize all initial configurations for which the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem is deterministically unsolvable under the considered robot model. For all the other remaining configurations, we provide a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage while minimizing the total distance traveled. These results characterize the deterministic solvability of min-sum coverage for oblivious robots and achieve optimal cost whenever solvable.</description>

      <title>Robotic Depowdering for Additive Manufacturing Via Pose Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of powder-based additive manufacturing, depowdering, a process of removing unfused powder that covers 3D-printed parts, has become a major bottleneck to further improve its productiveness. Traditional manual depowdering is extremely time-consuming and costly, and some prior automated systems either require pre-depowdering or lack adaptability to different 3D-printed parts. To solve these problems, we introduce a robotic system that automatically removes unfused powder from the surface of 3D-printed parts. The key component is a visual perception system, which consists of a pose-tracking module that tracks the 6D pose of powder-occluded parts in real-time, and a progress estimation module that estimates the depowdering completion percentage. The tracking module can be run efficiently on a laptop CPU at up to 60 FPS. Experiments show that our depowdering system can remove unfused powder from the surface of various 3D-printed parts without causing any damage. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first vision-based robotic depowdering systems that adapt to parts with various shapes without the need for pre-depowdering.</description>

      <title>Multi-Momentum Observer Contact Estimation for Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44% with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to enhance safety. Based on these constraints, the CMPC constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Path Tracking Using the Simplex Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot navigation in complex environments necessitates controllers that prioritize safety while remaining performant and adaptable. Traditional controllers like Regulated Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach, and Model-Predictive Path Integral, while reliable, struggle to adapt to dynamic conditions. Reinforcement Learning offers adaptability but state-wise safety guarantees remain challenging and often absent in practice. To address this, we propose a path tracking controller leveraging the Simplex architecture. It combines a Reinforcement Learning controller for adaptiveness and performance with a high-assurance controller providing safety and stability. Our main goal is to provide a safe testbed for the design and evaluation of path-planning algorithms, including machine-learning-based planners. Our contribution is twofold. We firstly discuss general stability and safety considerations for designing controllers using the Simplex architecture. Secondly, we present a Simplex-based path tracking controller. Our simulation results, supported by preliminary in-field tests, demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in maintaining safety while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive models can be particularly helpful for robots to effectively manipulate terrains in construction sites and extraterrestrial surfaces. However, terrain state representations become extremely high-dimensional especially to capture fine-resolution details and when depth is unknown or unbounded. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for terrain dynamics modeling and manipulation, leveraging the Graph-based Neural Dynamics (GBND) framework to represent terrain deformation as motion of a graph of particles. Based on the principle that the moving portion of a terrain is usually localized, our approach builds a large terrain graph (potentially millions of particles) but only identifies a very small active subgraph (hundreds of particles) for predicting the outcomes of robot-terrain interaction. To minimize the size of the active subgraph we introduce a learning-based approach that identifies a small region of interest (RoI) based on the robot's control inputs and the current scene. We also introduce a novel domain boundary feature encoding that allows GBNDs to perform accurate dynamics prediction in the RoI interior while avoiding particle penetration through RoI boundaries. Our proposed method is both orders of magnitude faster than naive GBND and it achieves better overall prediction accuracy. We further evaluated our framework on excavation and shaping tasks on terrain with different granularity.</description>

      <title>Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

      <title>PA-MPPI: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Quadrotor Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving this problem requires addressing three key challenges: path planning in non-convex free space due to obstacles, satisfying quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and exploring unknown regions to expand the map. Recently, the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution to the first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs such as energy consumption. However, MPPI has been limited to tracking control that optimizes trajectories only within a small neighborhood around a reference trajectory, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions and plan alternative paths when blocked by large obstacles. To address this limitation, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI (PA-MPPI). In this approach, perception-awareness is characterized by planning and adapting the trajectory online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded, PA-MPPI incorporates a perception cost that biases trajectories toward those that can observe unknown regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz, performs on par with the state-of-the-art quadrotor navigation planner for unknown environments in challenging test scenarios. Furthermore, we show that PA-MPPI can serve as a safe and robust action policy for navigation foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly reachable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Hand-Object\emph{(HO)GraspFlow}, an affordance-centric approach that retargets a single RGB with hand-object interaction (HOI) into multi-modal executable parallel jaw grasps without explicit geometric priors on target objects. Building on foundation models for hand reconstruction and vision, we synthesize $SE(3)$ grasp poses with denoising flow matching (FM), conditioned on the following three complementary cues: RGB foundation features as visual semantics, HOI contact reconstruction, and taxonomy-aware prior on grasp types. Our approach demonstrates high fidelity in grasp synthesis without explicit HOI contact input or object geometry, while maintaining strong contact and taxonomy recognition. Another controlled comparison shows that \emph{HOGraspFlow} consistently outperforms diffusion-based variants (\emph{HOGraspDiff}), achieving high distributional fidelity and more stable optimization in $SE(3)$. We demonstrate a reliable, object-agnostic grasp synthesis from human demonstrations in real-world experiments, where an average success rate of over $83\%$ is achieved.

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

      <title>Proactive Local-Minima-Free Robot Navigation: Blending Motion Prediction with Safe Control</title>

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Crane Lowering Guidance Using a Attachable Camera Module for Driver Vision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cranes have long been essential equipment for lifting and placing heavy loads in construction projects. This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission. This approach has the potential to significantly improve safety on construction sites by providing crane operators with an instant visual reference of hidden landing zones.</description>

      <title>OAT: Ordered Action Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap in Generalist Humanoid Motion Tracking and Teleoperation with Rapid Residual Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalist humanoid motion trackers have recently achieved strong simulation metrics by scaling data and training, yet often remain brittle on hardware during sustained teleoperation due to interface- and dynamics-induced errors. We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.

      <title>BagelVLA: Enhancing Long-Horizon Manipulation via Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.</description>

      <title>RoboSubtaskNet: Temporal Sub-task Segmentation for Human-to-Robot Skill Transfer in Real-World Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporally locating and classifying fine-grained sub-task segments in long, untrimmed videos is crucial to safe human-robot collaboration. Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>ZebraPose: Zebra Detection and Pose Estimation using only Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting and labeling large real-world wild animal datasets is impractical, costly, error-prone, and labor-intensive. For animal monitoring tasks, as detection, tracking, and pose estimation, out-of-distribution viewpoints (e.g. aerial) are also typically needed but rarely found in publicly available datasets. To solve this, existing approaches synthesize data with simplistic techniques that then necessitate strategies to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap. Therefore, real images, style constraints, complex animal models, or pre-trained networks are often leveraged. In contrast, we generate a fully synthetic dataset using a 3D photorealistic simulator and demonstrate that it can eliminate such needs for detecting and estimating 2D poses of wild zebras. Moreover, existing top-down 2D pose estimation approaches using synthetic data assume reliable detection models. However, these often fail in out-of-distribution scenarios, e.g. those that include wildlife or aerial imagery. Our method overcomes this by enabling the training of both tasks using the same synthetic dataset. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that models trained from scratch exclusively on our synthetic data generalize well to real images. We perform these using multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, pre-trained and randomly initialized backbones, and different image resolutions. Code, results, models, and data can be found athttps://zebrapose.is.tue.mpg.de/.</description>

      <title>Neural-Augmented Kelvinlet for Real-Time Soft Tissue Deformation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.</description>

      <title>Discrete Variational Autoencoding via Policy Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces.</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.</description>

      <title>CostNav: A Navigation Benchmark for Real-World Economic-Cost Evaluation of Physical AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current navigation benchmarks prioritize task success in simplified settings, they neglect the multidimensional economic constraints essential for the real-world commercialization of autonomous delivery systems. We introduce CostNav, an Economic Navigation Benchmark that evaluates physical AI agents through comprehensive economic cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. By integrating industry-standard data - such as SEC filings and AIS injury reports - with Isaac Sim's detailed collision and cargo dynamics, CostNav transcends simple task completion to accurately evaluate business value in complex, real-world scenarios. To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability, revealing that optimizing for task success on a simplified task fundamentally differs from optimizing for real-world economic deployment. Our evaluation of rule-based Nav2 navigation shows that current approaches are not economically viable: the contribution margin is -22.81/run (AMCL) and -12.87/run (GPS), resulting in no break-even point. We challenge the community to develop navigation policies that achieve economic viability on CostNav. We remain method-agnostic, evaluating success solely on the metric of cost rather than the underlying architecture. All resources are available at https://github.com/worv-ai/CostNav.</description>

      <title>First Multi-Constellation Observations of Navigation Satellite Signals in the Lunar Domain by Post-Processing L1/L5 IQ Snapshots</title>

Abstract: The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</description>

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.</description>

      <title>WorldArena: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Perception and Functional Utility of Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08971</link>

Abstract: While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://world-arena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.</description>

      <title>Lateral tracking control of all-wheel steering vehicles with intelligent tires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09427</link>

Abstract: The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies.</description>

      <title>First-order friction models with bristle dynamics: lumped and distributed formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.</description>
