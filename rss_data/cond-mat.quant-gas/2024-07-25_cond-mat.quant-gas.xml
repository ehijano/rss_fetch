      <title>Simulation of ultracold Bose gases with the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD thesis gives a comprehensive treatment of ab initio lattice Monte Carlo simulations of ultracold Bose gases by means of the complex Langevin algorithm. Since the field-theoretic action of non-relativistic bosons is a complex quantity, the corresponding path integral features a complex weight and is not accessible to standard Monte Carlo techniques. The complex Langevin algorithm represents an approach to overcome this obstacle, thereby providing the intriguing possibility of numerically exact simulations of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates within the field-theoretic framework. After reviewing the coherent-state path integral description of ultracold Bose gases as well as the complex Langevin method, we present the results of simulations in several physical scenarios. While parts of the thesis are based on arXiv:2204.10661 and arXiv:2304.05699 that treat the 3D and 2D homogeneous gas with contact interactions, it contains additional material covering external trapping potentials as well as Bose gases with long-range dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Massive-vortex realization of a Bosonic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass exchange between two rotating, quantum massive vortices in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. The vortices, in the majority component, exhibit a filled core, where the in-filling minority component undergoes a quantum tunneling effect. Remarkably, we observe that the two-vortex system features stable Josephson oscillations, as well as all the nonlinear phenomena, including the macroscopic quantum self-trapping, that characterize a Bosonic Josephson Junction (BJJ). We propose an analytical model for describing the inter-vortex tunneling, obtained by implementing the a coherent-state representation of the two-mode Bose-Hubbard model. This allows us to give the explicit expression of the model's parameters in terms of the physical macroscopic parameters of the two-vortex system. The comparison of the dynamical scenario predicted by the model with that emerging from the Gross-Pitaevskii equations is very good for sufficiently small particle numbers, while at larger particle numbers it grows less precise, presumably due to the partial exclusion of the many-body interactions from our model. The definition of an effective self-interaction parameter allows us to include the many-body effects, thus restoring a quite good agreement with the numerical results. Interestingly, the recognition of the bosonic Josephson dynamics paves the way to the investigation of new dynamical behaviors in multi-vortex configurations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-tunable anisotropic black-body radiation in dynamical axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An antiferromagnetic order breaking simultaneously the time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries in topological insulators might give rise to dynamical axion-like fields in the form of longitudinal spin waves. The consequences of the associated axion-polariton state on the thermal radiation are investigated. Planck's radiation law is shown to exhibit remarkable anisotropic behavior as a result of the strong refraction caused by the heat-matter interaction. A crossover scenario at low temperature is identified and an associated regime in which the system's internal energy does not scale with the traditional fourth power of the temperature is revealed. We show that the polarization purity of the heat radiation and its angular distribution can be controlled via the magnetic field, paving the way toward a directional-tunable mechanism for thermal quanta manipulation and storage.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit gates and Schr\"odinger cat states in an optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are exotic transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. They are associated to a one-point gap closing between distinct locally ordered phases, thus to a continuous phase transition. Because of this intrinsic criticality, at deconfined quantum critical points algebraic decay of all the correlation functions is expected. Here, we show that it is possible to go beyond this assumption. Specifically, we consider one dimensional interacting fermions where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation arises. We first explore the low energy regimes where a sine-Gordon Hamiltonian can provide accurate results. By means of a field theory approach we find that continuous phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can occur. As a consequence of the decoupled spin and charge degrees of freedom, we find that in two cases only one gap vanishes while the other remains finite. We then derive a microscopic model where such phase transitions take place. By performing a numerical analysis, we unambiguously find that deconfined quantum critical points can indeed be further characterized by the long-range order of a parity operator signaling the presence of a finite gap. Our results provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>
