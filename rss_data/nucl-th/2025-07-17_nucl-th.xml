      <title>Systematic study of the propagation of uncertainties to transfer observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of parametric uncertainties in transfer reactions is performed using the recently developed uncertainty quantified global optical potential (KDUQ). We consider reactions on the doubly-magic spherical nucleus $^{48}$Ca and explore the dependence of the predicted $(d,p)$ angular distribution uncertainties at different beam energies and for different properties of the final single-particle state populated by the reaction. Our results show that correlations between the uncertainties associated with the bound state potential and with the optical potentials may be important for correctly determining the uncertainty in the transfer cross sections (in our case, these do not add in quadrature). In general, we find small uncertainties in the predicted transfer observables: half-width of the 68% credible interval is roughly $5-10$%, which is comparable to the experimental error on the transfer data. Finally, our results show that the relative magnitude of the parametric uncertainty in transfer observables increases with the beam energy and does not depend strongly on the properties of the final state.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of the validity of the eikonal model including uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions at intermediate beam energies are often interpreted using the eikonal model. In the analysis of complex reaction probes, where few-body reaction methods are needed, the eikonal method may be used as an efficient way for describing the fragment-target reaction process. In this work, we perform a systematic study to test the validity of the eikonal approximation for nucleon-nucleus reactions. We also quantify uncertainties due to the nucleon optical potential on reaction observables. We inspect the validity of the eikonal model and its semiclassical correction by comparing it to exact solutions (obtained from solving the optical model equation with a finite differences method) for a wide range of reactions. We also study the effect of relativistic corrections, both kinematic and dynamic, by effectively incorporating the relativistic effects at intermediate energies. The uncertainties from a Bayesian global optical potential (KDUQ) are propagated to the observables of interest. Our study includes neutron and proton reactions on $^{27}$Al, $^{40}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb, for a wide range of energies $E_{lab}=0-400$ MeV. Our results show that for the proton absorption cross section, the eikonal model can be used down to around $60$ MeV and the semiclassical correction extends its use to $30$ MeV. However, the validity of the eikonal model for the neutron total cross section only goes down to $\approx120$ MeV, a range extended to $\approx 50$ MeV when using the semiclassical correction. We find the semi-classical correction to the eikonal model to be less effective in describing the angular distributions. The $1\sigma$ uncertainty intervals on the observables we studied is less than $5$% for most of the energies considered, but increases rapidly for higher energies, namely energies outside the range of KDUQ ($E_{lab}&gt;200$ MeV).</description>

      <title>Systematics from NICER Pulse Profiles Drive Uncertainty in Multi-Messenger Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties: the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution and fragmentation functions with massive gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correct description of the hadron's structure requires understanding how quarks and gluons form the observable hadrons and how they are distributed within them. Two key nonperturbative quantities encapsulate this information: parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). The former define a probabilistic light-front momentum distribution of partons within a hadron, whereas the latter describe the hadronization process of high-energy partons. Computing these functions analytically poses significant challenges, as it demands models that accurately incorporate the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we compute the pion PDF and its elementary and full FFs using the Curci-Ferrari (CF) model. This model enables the exploration of nonperturbative QCD effects by introducing a gluon-mass scale within the Landau gauge QCD Lagrangian. The two-point quark and gluon correlation functions derived from the CF model agree well with lattice QCD results and reproduce the pion decay constant in the chiral limit, consistent with chiral perturbation theory. The resulting pion PDF and FFs computed with the CF quark propagator and pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with those obtained using the Qin-Chang model, a benchmark approach to nonperturbative QCD. These findings support the broader applicability of the Curci-Ferrari model in hadron phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation from an Analytic Hydrodynamic Model with Hadronic and QGP Sources in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a nearly perfect fluid is formed, known as the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). After a short thermalization period, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes a transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement. Direct photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning from the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon production, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and extends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, incorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that predicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model is constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the quark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of non-prompt direct photon spectra in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, across four centrality classes. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of the initial temperature. These results offer new insights into the space-time evolution of the thermal photon source and provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>High-precision baryon number cumulants from lattice QCD in a finite box: cumulant ratios, Lee-Yang zeros and critical endpoint predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.</description>

      <title>Reaction mechanism of quasi-free knockout processes in exotic RI beam era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-free nucleon knockout reaction has been revealed the single-particle nature of nuclei. Thanks to the advances in experimental techniques and reaction theory, various new aspects of nuclei are being revealed by knockout reactions. In this article, we review the basic concept of the quasi-free knockout reaction, and recent achievements in the SEASTAR project using the MINOS system. We also present our new findings on the low-energy nucleon knockout reaction and the $\alpha$ knockout reaction. The combination of the (microscopic) structure theory, reaction theory and experiments will be the key to a complete understanding of the $\alpha$ formation and its universality in the coming decades. Noble clusters, e.g., $d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, etc. are in the scope of the ONOKORO project. The implementation of the two (and more) nucleon correlation in the reaction theory is essential to connect the properties of such clusters and the reaction observables. A new framework, CDCCIA, is introduced for this purpose, which will also be applicable to the two-nucleon knockout reactions, e.g., $(p,3p)$, $(p,2pn)$, and $(p,p2n)$.</description>

      <title>A Novel View on the Inner Crusts of Neo-Neutron Stars: exotic light nuclei, diffusional and thermodynamical stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model, we investigate the properties of non-accreted crusts of young and warm neo-neutron stars, i.e., of finite-temperature inhomogeneous dense matter in beta equilibrium. The first new feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust, of an extensive and almost pure layer of neutron-rich light nuclei that extends up to the density of the transition to homogeneous matter. This layer may challenge the idea of nuclear pasta phases, significantly impact the transport properties and the crust crystallization process. Then, we raise the question of the (in)stability of the inner crust with respect to diffusion of ions (buoyancy) and demonstrate that our crust is stable, in contrast with the predictions of some other models. Finally, we show that subsaturated clusterized stellar matter is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>New {\em ab initio} constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: I. Subsaturation density domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars mergers, information about the energetics and composition of matter is implemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic conditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general-purpose equation of state (EOS) tables have been contributed so far. Unfortunately, not all of them comply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic investigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution of these astrophysical phenomena require that more EOS tables are provided. We build a set of general-purpose EOS tables. At zero temperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including {\em ab initio} chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors of the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide range of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions generated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter (NM). Here, we study the properties of sub-saturated inhomogeneous NM over wide ranges of density, temperature, and proton fraction. We analyze in detail the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter and estimate the transition density. Our key results include a thick layer of neutron rich isotopes of He or H in the inner crusts of neo-neutron stars, significant abundance of exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron-rich matter and a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter. The EOS tables are publicly available in the \textsc{CompOSE} online database.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for spacetime gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: The arguably most promising avenue towards testing physics beyond the Standard Model in the anomalous magnetic moment of the $\tau$ proceeds via suitably constructed asymmetries in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ in the presence of a polarized electron beam. Such a program, as could be realized at Belle II assuming a polarization upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider, crucially relies on a careful consideration of radiative corrections. In this work, we present the complete one-loop result for the fully polarized $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ process and its implementation in the Monte-Carlo integrator McMule. As an application, we discuss projections relevant for measurements at Belle II, both with and without electron polarization, and outline the necessary steps for a generalization to next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cold QCD: Review and Future Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>
