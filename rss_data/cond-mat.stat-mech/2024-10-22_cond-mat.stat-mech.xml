      <title>Minimal thermodynamic cost of communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic cost of real world computers, both biological and digital. However, little is known about the fundamental features of this cost. Addressing this hole in the literature, our first major contribution is a strictly positive lower bound on on the unavoidable entropy production (EP) in any physical system that implements a communication channel. Specifically, we derive a relationship between the rate of information transmission across a channel and the minimal thermodynamic cost incurred by any physical systems that implements that transmission. We use this relationship to show that under certain conditions, transmitting information through multiple, high-noise channels (reverse multiplexing) can be thermodynamically more efficient than using a single, low noise channel. We then address the thermodynamic costs inherent in the computational front-ends and back ends to communication channels, which are used to implement error correcting codes over those channels an essential component of modern communication systems. Our second major contribution is a strictly positive lower bound on the minimal EP of any physical system that implements those encoding and decoding algorithms. We use this bound to make a detailed comparison of the minimal thermodynamic costs across various linear codes and error rates. Because our results are like the second law, applying independently of the physical details of the system, they provide valuable insights into the trade offs between decoding error and thermodynamic efficiency. This gives a deeper understanding of the interplay between algorithmic design of error-correcting codes and physical constraints in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Martingale drift of Langevin dynamics and classical canonical spin statistics -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous paper we have shown analytically that, if the drift function of the d-dimensional Langevin equation is the Langevin function with a properly chosen scale factor, then the evolution of the drift function is a martingale associated with the histories generated by the very Langevin equation. Moreover, we numerically demonstrated that those generated histories from a common initial data become asymptotically ballistic, whose orientations obey the classical canonical spin statistics under the external field corresponding to the initial data. In the present paper we provide with an analytical explanation of the latter numerical finding by introducing a martingale in the spin functional space. In a specific context the present result elucidates a new physical aspect of martingale theory.</description>

      <title>Global Topological Dirac Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

      <title>Floquet-Enriched Nontrivial Topology at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Ising models -- Critical Parameters using $\epsilon$-convergence method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the applicability of the $\epsilon$-convergence algorithm in extracting the critical temperatures and critical exponents of three-dimensional Ising models. We analyze the low temperature magnetization as well as high temperature susceptibility series of simple cubic, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic and diamond lattices, using two different variables for the inverse critical temperature. In the case of simple cubic lattices, the magnetization series was modified to deduce accurate values of the critical temperatures. The alternate variable for dimensionless inverse temperature suggested by Guttmann and Thompson has also been employed for the estimation of the critical parameters.</description>

      <title>Solvation Free Energies from Neural Thermodynamic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to compute solvation free energies via thermodynamic integration along a neural-network potential interpolating between two target Hamiltonians. We use a stochastic interpolant to define an interpolation between the distributions at the level of samples and optimize a neural network potential to match the corresponding equilibrium potential at every intermediate time-step. Once the alignment between the interpolating samples and the interpolating potentials is sufficiently accurate, the free-energy difference between the two Hamiltonians can be estimated using (neural) thermodynamic integration. We validate our method to compute solvation free energies on several benchmark systems: a Lennard-Jones particle in a Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as the insertion of both water and methane solutes in a water solvent at atomistic resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some representative results for first-passage problems involving so-called mortal or evanescent walkers, i.e., walkers with a finite lifetime. The mortality constraint plays a key role in the modeling of many real scenarios, as it filters out long Brownian trajectories, thereby drastically modifying space exploration properties. Among such scenarios, we consider here different first-passage problems, including one or many searchers, resetting, anomalous diffusion, evolving domains, and the narrow escape problem. In spite of the different physics, the mathematical treatment draws strongly on the formalism for standard (i.e., immortal) walkers.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and practical approaches for investigating irreversible processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research in statistical mechanics mostly concerns the investigation of out-of-equilibrium, irreversible processes, which are ubiquitous in nature and still far from being theoretically understood. Even the precise characterization of irreversibility is the object of an open debate: while in the context of Hamiltonian systems the one-century-old proposal by M. Smoluchowski looks still valid (a process appears irreversible when the initial state has a recurrence time that is long compared to the time of observation [1]), in dissipative systems, particularly in the case of stochastic processes, the problem is more involved, and quantifying the "degree of irreversibility" is a pragmatic need. The most employed strategies rely on the estimation of entropy production: this quantity, although mathematically well-defined, is often difficult to compute, especially when analyzing experimental data. Moreover, being a global observable, entropy production fails to capture specific aspects of irreversibility in extended systems, such as the role of different currents and their spatial development. This review aims to address various conceptual and technical challenges encountered in the analysis of irreversibility, including the role of the coarse-graining procedure and the treatment of data in the absence of complete information. The discussion will be mostly based on simple models, analytically treatable, and supplemented by examples of complex, more realistic non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</description>

      <title>Universal Linear Response of the Mean First-Passage Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it is not applicable to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare, rather than weak, perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without requiring any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. Remarkably, our approach bypasses the need for explicit problem-solving, allowing us to unravel and explain the highly non-trivial response phase space of these systems. Our results simplify the analysis of complex systems, offering a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on first-passage processes across various scenarios and research fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetic susceptibility and entanglement of three interacting qubits under magnetic field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a system of three entangled qubits within the XXX model, subjected to an external magnetic field in the $z$-direction and incorporating an anisotropy term along the $y$-axis. We explore the thermodynamics of the system by calculating its magnetic susceptibility and analyzing how this quantity encodes information about entanglement. By deriving rigorous bounds for susceptibility, we demonstrate that their violation serves as an entanglement witness. Our results show that anisotropy enhances entanglement, extending the temperature range over which it persists. Additionally, by tracing over the degrees of freedom of two qubits, we examine the reduced density matrix of the remaining qubits and find that its entropy under the influence of the magnetic field can be mapped to an effective thermal bath at $(B,K) &gt; 0$ K.</description>

      <title>A problem with the conservation law observed in macroscopic quantum phenomena is a consequence of violation of the correspondence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article draws attention that the puzzle of the change of the angular momentum without any force is a consequence of the contradiction of macroscopic quantum phenomena with the correspondence principle, which reveals a fundamental difference between microscopic quantum phenomena, described by the Schrodinger wave mechanics, and macroscopic quantum phenomena, described by the theory of superconductivity and the theory of superfluidity. To explain why macroscopic quantum phenomena are observed despite the correspondence principle, Lev Landau postulated in 1941 that microscopic particles in superfluid helium and superconductor cannot move separately. The angular momentum can change without any force only due to quantization in both microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle eliminates the contradiction with the conservation law in the first case, since according to the correspondence principle, the change in angular momentum cannot exceed the Planck constant. But this principle cannot eliminate the contradiction with the conservation law the macroscopic change of angular momentum due to quantization observed in superconductors contrary to the correspondence principle. Quantization can change not only the angular momentum, but also the kinetic energy of a superconducting condensate on a macroscopic amount. For this reason, the Meissner effect and other macroscopic quantum phenomena contradict the second law of thermodynamics. The reluctance of physicists to admit the violation of the second law of thermodynamics provoked a false understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity and obvious contradictions in books on superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Noise resilience in adaptive and symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits offer great perspectives for exploring the interplay of quantum information and complex quantum dynamics. These systems could realize the extensively studied entanglement and purification phase transitions, as well as a rich variety of symmetry-protected and ordered non-equilibrium phases. The central question regarding such phases is whether they survive in real-world devices exhibiting unavoidable symmetry-breaking noise. We study the fate of the symmetry-protected absorbing state and charge-sharpening transitions in the presence of symmetry-breaking noise, and establish that the net effect of noise results in coherent and incoherent symmetry-breaking effects. The coherent contribution removes a sharp distinction between different phases and renders phase transitions to crossovers. Nevertheless, states far away from the original phase boundaries retain their essential character. In fact, corrective feedback in adaptive quantum circuits and postselected measurements in symmetric charge-conserving quantum circuits can suppress the effects of noise, thereby stabilizing the absorbing and charge-sharp phases, respectively. Despite the unavoidable noise in current quantum hardwares, our findings offer an optimistic outlook for observing symmetry-protected phases in currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Moreover, our work suggests a symmetry-based benchmarking method as an alternative for characterizing noise and evaluating average local gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>Long-range order in two-dimensional systems with fluctuating active stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional tissues, such as developing germ layers, pair-wise forces (or active stresses) arise from the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton, with dissipation provided by the three-dimensional surroundings. We show analytically how these pair-wise stochastic forces, unlike the particle-wise independent fluctuating forces usually considered in active matter systems, produce conserved centre-of-mass dynamics and so are able to damp large-wavelength displacement fluctuations in elastic systems. A consequence of this is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions, in clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence of hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \sim q^2$ in the $q \to 0$ limit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these pair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is represented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions and with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an active disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of equal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We confirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models and show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus constituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of this mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and to also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.</description>

      <title>Unifying homogeneous and inhomogeneous rheology of dense suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rheology of dense suspensions lacks a universal description due to the involvement of a wide variety of parameters, ranging from the physical properties of solid particles to the nature of the external deformation or applied stress. While the former controls microscopic interactions, spatial variations in the latter induce heterogeneity in the flow, making it difficult to find suitable constitutive laws to describe the rheology in a unified way. For homogeneous driving with a spatially uniform strain rate, the rheology of non-Brownian dense suspensions is well described by the conventional $\mu(J)$ rheology. However, this rheology fails in the inhomogeneous case due to non-local effects, where the flow in one region is influenced by the flow in another. Here, motivated by observations from simulation data, we introduce a new dimensionless number, the suspension temperature $\Theta_s$, which contains information on local particle velocity fluctuations. We find that $\mu(J,\Theta_s)$ provides a unified description for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows. By employing scaling theory, we identify a set of constitutive laws for dense suspensions of frictional spherical particles and frictionless rod-shaped particles. Combining these scaling relations with the momentum balance equation for our model system, we predict the spatial variation of the relevant dimensionless numbers, the volume fraction $\phi$, the viscous number $J$, the macroscopic friction coefficient $\mu$, and $\Theta_s$ solely from the nature of the imposed external driving.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider emergence from the perspective of dynamics: states of a system evolving with time. We focus on the role of a decomposition of wholes into parts, and attempt to characterize relationships between levels without reference to whether higher-level properties are "novel" or "unexpected." We offer a classification of different varieties of emergence, with and without new ontological elements at higher levels.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

Abstract: Using the secured transactions recorded within the Money Markets Statistical Reporting database of the European Central Bank, we test several stylized facts regarding interbank market of the 47 largest banks in the eurozone. We observe that the surge in the volume of traded evergreen repurchase agreements followed the introduction of the LCR regulation and we measure a rate of collateral re-use consistent with the literature. Regarding the topology of the interbank network, we confirm the high level of network stability but observe a higher density and a higher in- and out-degree symmetry than what is reported for unsecured markets.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail, $t^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \text{or } \frac{9}{4}$ for different operators. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. The numerical results are fully consistent with the emergence of hydrodynamics at long times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system is called antifragile when damage acts as a constructive element improving the performance of a global function. In this paper, we analyze the emergence of antifragility in the movement of random walkers on networks with modular structures or communities. The random walker hops considering the capacity of transport of each link, whereas the links are susceptible to random damage that accumulates over time. We show that in networks with communities and high modularity, the localization of damage in specific groups of nodes leads to a global antifragile response of the system improving the capacity of stochastic transport to more easily reach the nodes of a network. Our findings give evidence of the mechanisms behind antifragile response in complex systems and pave the way for their quantitative exploration in different fields.</description>

      <title>Effective Affinity for Generic Currents in Markov Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective affinity that applies to generic currents in time-homogeneous Markov processes. This effective affinity extents a previously introduced effective affinity for currents that quantify the net transitions between two states in a Markov chain, known as edge currents. Extending the effective affinity to include generic currents is important for its application in experiments because currents of interest, like the positional currents in molecular motors, are typically not edge currents. We show that the effective affinity is a single number encapsulating several dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents: the effective affinity determines the direction of flow of the current; the effective affinity multiplied by the current is a lower bound for the rate of dissipation; for unicyclic systems the effective affinity is the standard thermodynamic affinity; and the effective affinity constrains negative fluctuations of currents, namely, it is the exponential decay constant of the distribution of current infima. We derive the above properties by using large deviation theory and martingale theory, and we introduce a family of martingales associated with generic currents. Furthermore, we make a study of the relation between effective affinities and stalling forces in a biomechanical model of motor proteins, and we find that they are almost identical when the model is thermodynamically consistent. This brings interesting perspectives on the use of stalling forces for the estimation of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Stretched-Exponential Melting of a Dynamically Frozen State Under Imprinted Phase Noise in the Ising Chain in a Transverse Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical freezing is a phenomenon where a set of local observables emerges as approximate but stable conserved quantities (freezes) under a strong periodic drive in a closed quantum system. The expectation values of these emergent conserved quantities exhibit small fluctuations around their respective initial values. These fluctuations do not grow with time, and their magnitude can be tuned down sharply by tuning the drive parameters. In this work, we probe the resilience of dynamical freezing to random perturbations added to the relative phases between the interfering states (elements of a natural basis) in the time-evolving wave function after each drive cycle. We study this in an integrable Ising chain in a time-periodic transverse field. Our key finding is, that the imprinted phase noise melts the dynamically frozen state, but the decay is "slow": a stretched-exponential decay rather than an exponential one. Stretched-exponential decays (also known as Kohlrausch relaxation) are usually expected in complex systems with time-scale hierarchies due to strong disorders or other inhomogeneities resulting in jamming, glassiness, or localization.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mpemba effects (MPEs), where a hotter system cools faster than a colder one, present intriguing anomalies in relaxation processes. Despite their universal observation and significant fundamental and practical implications, a comprehensive theoretical understanding based on microscopic properties remains elusive. In this Letter, we introduce two universal frameworks for classical systems to address this gap. Firstly, we reveal that MPEs, traditionally defined by macroscopic temperature comparisons, can be understood through microstate comparisons. This insight offers a straightforward and universal microscopic perspective on MPEs, relevant for experiments and numerical simulations to identify their microscopic origins. Secondly, we establish a "no-Mpemba theorem," a rigorous sufficient condition for the absence of MPEs, thereby identifying specific classes of systems devoid of these effects. Our findings are exemplified using ferromagnetic Ising models and one-dimensional multiparticle systems, demonstrating the practical applicability of our theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Random walks with long-range memory on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable random walk model with long-range memory on arbitrary networks. The walker performs unbiased random steps to nearest-neighbor nodes and intermittently resets to previously visited nodes in a preferential way, such that the most visited nodes have proportionally a higher probability to be chosen for revisit. The occupation probability can be expressed as a sum over the eigenmodes of the standard random walk matrix of the network, where the amplitudes slowly decay as power-laws at large time, instead of exponentially. The stationary state is the same as in the absence of memory and detailed balance is fulfilled. However, the relaxation of the transient part becomes critically self-organized at late times, as it is dominated by a single power-law whose exponent depends on the second largest eigenvalue and on the resetting probability. We apply our findings to finite networks such as rings, complete graphs, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert random networks, or Barbell graphs. Our study extends to network geometries a previous preferential model considering confined diffusive particles in one dimension, and could be of interest for modeling transport phenomena in complex systems, such as human mobility, epidemic spreading, or animal foraging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ensemble with exponentially decaying random disconnection probabilities determined by an i.i.d. field of variables with heavy tails and infinite mean associated to the vertices of the graph. This model was recently investigated in the physics literature in Garuccio et al. (2020) as a scale-invariant random graph within the context of network renormalization. From a mathematical perspective, the model fits in the class of scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs whose asymptotic geometrical features have been recently attracting interest. While for this type of graphs several results are known when the underlying vertex variables have finite mean and variance, here instead we consider the case of one-sided stable variables with necessarily infinite mean. To simplify our analysis, we assume that the variables are sampled from a Pareto distribution with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We start by characterizing the asymptotic distributions of the typical degrees and some related observables. In particular, we show that the degree of a vertex converges in distribution, after proper scaling, to a mixed Poisson law. We then show that correlations among degrees of different vertices are asymptotically non-vanishing, but at the same time a form of asymptotic tail independence is found when looking at the behavior of the joint Laplace transform around zero. Moreover, we present some findings concerning the asymptotic density of wedges and triangles and show a cross-over for the existence of dust (i.e. disconnected vertices).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define predictive states and predictive complexity for quantum systems composed of distinct subsystems. This complexity is a generalization of entanglement entropy. It is inspired by the statistical or forecasting complexity of predictive state analysis of stochastic and complex systems theory, but is intrinsically quantum. Predictive states of a subsystem are formed by equivalence classes of state vectors in the exterior Hilbert space that effectively predict the same future behavior of that subsystem for some time. As an illustrative example, we present calculations in the dynamics of an isotropic Heisenberg model spin chain and show that, in comparison to the entanglement entropy, the predictive complexity better signifies dynamically important events, such as magnon collisions. It can also serve as a local order parameter that can distinguish long and short range entanglement.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems leading to a universal description of the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extended local ergotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems, maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time. Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time, and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries and free system-environment evolution. We provide examples based on the Jaynes-Cummings model, presenting practical protocols and analytic results that serve as proof of principle for the aforementioned advantages.</description>

      <title>Work Sum Rule for Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under which entropy is nonsingular is based on a partition of Hilbert space, which assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the environment. However, quantum work partitions nontrivially under Hilbert-space partition, and we derive a work sum rule that accounts for quantum work at a distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. Our results are illustrated with application to a driven resonant level strongly coupled to a reservoir.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydroelectronic drag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain for graphene and nonrelativistic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic and comparative research on Lorenz ratios for graphene and nonrelativistic systems has been studied to identify their Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain. Fermi energy and temperature are the main governing parameters for deciding the values of the Lorenz ratio, which is basically thermal conductivity divided by electrical conductivity times temperature times Lorenz number. Metals as three-dimensional nonrelativistic electron gas locate at higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain, where Lorenz ratio remains one. Hence, they obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. By creating higher doping in a two-dimensional graphene system, one can again reach a higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain and get a constant Lorenz ratio. For both graphene and non-relativistic systems, the Lorenz ratio goes below one if we go lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain, which is possible for the graphene system by decreasing the doping concentration. Experimentally observed greater than one Lorenz ratio in this lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain or Dirac Fluid domain indicates that non-fluid expressions of Lorenz ratio should be replaced by fluid-type expressions. We have noticed a divergent trend of Lorenz ratio in the Dirac Fluid domain using its fluid-type expression, and it matches with the trend of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Ground state properties of the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compass models provide insights into the properties of Mott-insulating materials that host bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between their pseudospin degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the classical and quantum ground state properties of one such model relevant to certain layered perovskite materials akin to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ - namely, the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice. We first investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model using classical Monte Carlo simulations. These reveal that the low temperature classical phase diagram is divided into six different classes of long-range ordered phases, including four phases that exhibit an order by disorder selection and two phases that are stabilized energetically. This model admits a special duality transformation, known as the Klein duality, conveniently allowing to map one region of coupling parameters onto another and constraining the phase diagram, and which we exploit in our study. From the analysis of the zero-point energy and the free energy of the spin waves, we find that order by quantum disorder at zero temperature and order by thermal disorder select the same orderings as those found from classical Monte Carlo simulations. We further investigate the quantum ground states of this model using numerical exact diagonalization on small clusters by exploiting the translational symmetry of the square lattice. We obtain a ground state phase diagram bearing close resemblance to that found from the classical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework to determine the upper bound to the complexity of a computing a given observable with respect to a Hamiltonian. By considering the Heisenberg evolution of the observable, we show that each Hamiltonian defines an equivalence relation, causing the operator space to be partitioned into equivalence classes. Any operator within a specific class never leaves its equivalence class during the evolution. We provide a method to determine the dimension of the equivalence classes and evaluate it for various models, such as the $ XY $ chain and Kitaev model on trees. Our findings reveal that the complexity of operator evolution in the $XY$ model grows from the edge to the bulk, which is physically manifested as suppressed relaxation of qubits near the boundary. Our methods are used to reveal several new cases of simulable quantum dynamics, including a $XY$-$ZZ$ model which cannot be reduced to free fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$ taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to neutral operators in the $\phi^4$ in $d=4-\epsilon$, $\phi^3$ in $d=6-\epsilon$, and $\phi^6$ in $d=3-\epsilon$ theories with $O(N)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped by the brain's structural organization. However, the theoretical principles explaining how this physical architecture governs its function remain elusive. Here, we propose an algebraic quantum mechanics (AQM) framework in which the functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system defined on the underlying directed multigraph. These equilibrium states, derived from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states formalism, capture the contribution of each neuron to the overall information flow. We apply this framework to the connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, providing a detailed description of the KMS states, exploring their functional implications, and predicting functional networks based on anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, our approach reveals functional circuits predicted by the topology of the connectome and illuminates on the mechanisms linking structure to function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>
