      <title>Sea ice aging by diffusion-driven desalination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice is a key component of the Earth's climate system, making its aging process an essential focus of current research. The age of sea ice is closely linked to its thermal and mechanical properties, which govern its interactions with the surrounding environment. In this study, we combine experimental techniques and modeling to explore the full dynamical process of mushy ice growth and spontaneous aging in saline water, within a natural convective flow system. We show that the aging of newly formed mushy ice in the present system, characterized by a gradual long-term reduction in porosity, is controlled by diffusion-driven desalination. Moreover, we observe that the system eventually transits into a dense freshwater ice layer adjacent to a well-mixed saline water region. The shape of the ice layer in this asymptotic state is well captured by numerical simulations of non-porous ice. Our findings improve the understanding of the complex physics governing phase changes in aqueous systems and provide a framework for studying sea ice aging in laboratory settings, with implications spanning diverse natural and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Signature of Pressure Gradient History on Wall Shear Stress in Turbulent Boundary Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our experiments evaluate the presence of history effects on wall shear stress in turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) subjected to five sequences of favorable and adverse pressure gradients (FAPGs) of increasing strength. Steady but spatially varying FAPGs are imposed on a flat plate using a deformable convex false ceiling. An array of three one-dimensional capacitive probes, positioned in the adverse pressure gradient (APG) region downstream of the favorable pressure gradient (FPG), enables direct and high-frequency measurements of wall shear stress. We first characterize the sensor performance under canonical zero pressure gradient (ZPG) conditions across a range of Reynolds numbers. With increasing FAPG strength, a non-monotonic increase in skin friction and a reduction in normalized wall shear stress fluctuations are observed, indicating long-lasting upstream FPG influence within the downstream APG region. These effects are more pronounced at lower Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the influence of large-scale structures in FAPG on wall shear stress is studied through coherence spectrum, two points cross-correlation, and convection velocity.</description>

      <title>Significance of secondary baroclinic hydrodynamic instability on mixing enhancement in shock-bubble interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different strength of hydrodynamic instability can be induced by the variations in the initial diffusion of shock bubble interaction (SBI), while the influence of hydrodynamic instability on variable-density mixing in SBI remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the hydrodynamic instability of SBI through high-resolution numerical simulations. To isolate each factor within this instability, a circulation control method is employed to ensure consistent Reynolds number Re and Peclect number Pe. An examination of the morphology of the bubbles and vorticity dynamics reveals that the hydrodynamic instability can be characterized by positive circulation. Through vorticity budget analysis, the positive circulation is dominated by the baroclinic torque. Therefore, the identified hydrodynamic instability is labeled as secondary baroclinic hydrodynamic instability (SBHI). Based on the dimensional analysis of vorticity transport equation, a new dimensionless parameter, the secondary baroclinic vorticity (SBV) number, is proposed to characterize the strength of SBHI. Regarding mixing characteristics, cases with stronger SBHI exhibit higher mixing rates. Indicated by the temporal-averaged mixing rate with different SBV numbers, a scaling behavior is revealed: the mixing rate is increased proportionally to the square of SBV numbers. It is widely recognized that unstable flow can also be induced by a high Reynolds number Re. The distinction and connection of SBHI and high Re unstable flow are further studied. The scaling behavior of the mixing rate in SBHI shows distinct from the Reynolds number Re scaling: the mixing can hardly be altered effectively in the limit of large Re, the mechanisms of which are inherently different with respect to the stretch term, closely relating to the principal strain and the alignment angle between the scalar gradient and the principal strain axis.</description>

      <title>Fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with the guaranteed H-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with a slight modification is discussed on the basis of the Chapman-Enskog method. This modified version of the Enskog equation has been shown recently by the present authors to ensure the H-theorem. In the present paper, it is shown that the modified version recovers the same fluid-dynamic description of the dense gas as the original Enskog equation, at least up to the level of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier set of equations inclusive. Since the original Enskog equation is known to recover the fluid-dynamical transport properties well, this result implies that the modified version of the Enskog equation provides consistent descriptions both thermodynamically and fluid-dynamically.</description>

      <title>Distinct Lifetime Scaling Laws of Turbulent Puff in Duct Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatio-temporal dynamics of localized turbulent puffs $-$ the characteristic transitional structures in square duct flows $-$ are investigated through direct numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. It is revealed that the turbulent puffs are transient structures, exhibiting distinct relaminarization regimes bifurcated at a critical Reynolds number $Re_c\simeq1450$. Puff's mean lifetimes at the subcritical regime ($Re&lt;Re_c$) follow a square-root scaling law with increasing $Re$, transitioning to a super-exponential scaling in the supercritical regime ($Re &gt; Re_c$). By implementing pattern preservation approximation, the Reynolds-Orr kinetic energy equation is reduced to a noisy saddle-node bifurcation equation, which explains the observed scaling laws in terms of the deterministic decay governed by the critical slowing down at the subcritical regime, and the abrupt decay activated by the stochastic fluctuations. Despite geometric confinement inducing unique secondary flows, e.g., corner-localized streamwise vortex pairs, corner-aligned high-speed streaks, and forked low-speed streaks, the puff lifetime statistics remain analogous to those in pipe flows, suggesting geometric invariance in decay mechanisms for transitional wall-surrounded turbulence.</description>

      <title>Transient dispersion in oscillatory flows: auxiliary-time extension method for concentration moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion phenomenon of mass and heat transport in oscillatory flows has wide applications in environmental, physiological and microfluidic flows. The method of concentration moments is a powerful theoretical tool for analyzing transport characteristics and is well-developed for steady flows. However, the general solutions of moments derived by Barton (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983, pp. 205-218) cannot be applied directly to unsteady flows. Prior studies needed to re-solve the governing equations of moments from scratch, encountering the complication induced by the time-periodic velocity, leaving higher-order statistics like skewness and kurtosis analytically intractable except for specific cases. This work proposes a novel approach based on a two-time-variable extension to tackle these challenges. By introducing an auxiliary time variable, referred to as oscillation time to characterize the inherent oscillation in the dispersion due to the oscillating flow, the transport problem is extended to a two-time-variable system with a "steady" flow term. This enables the direct use of Barton's expressions and thus avoids the prior complication. This approach not only offers an intuitive physical perspective for the influence of the velocity oscillation but also clarifies the solution structure of concentration moments. As a preliminary verification, we examine the transport problem in an oscillatory Couette flow. The analytical solution agrees well with the numerical result by Brownian dynamics simulations. The effects of the point-source release and the phase shift of velocity on the transport characteristics are investigated. By extending the classic steady-flow solution to the time-dependent flows, this work provides a versatile framework for transient dispersion analysis, enhancing predictions in oscillatory transport problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to simulate the behavior of the reactive flow of the turbulent flame in aeronautical combustion chamber of the ALLISON-T56 turboprop, and contribute to the analysis of flame structure and determine for given pressure and temperature of fresh gas the behavior of the thermodynamic parameters of combustion. The numerical approach is based on the resolution of basic equations of turbulent combustion using Ansys-Fluent code where the turbulence model K-e is chosen, the geometry of the combustion chamber is made using Ansys-workbench software. Thereafter, we simulate the transient temperature field through the wall of a tubular combustion chamber, and the characterization of the thermal expansion, the thermoelastic stresses and strains with the physical properties of refractory materials. The obtained results are then compared with the results of the scientific literature</description>

      <title>Coupled Fire-Cloud Simulations Reveal Mechanisms of Pyrocumulonimbus Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms occur when the updraft from a wildfire forms a precipitating cloud. These clouds create unpredictable winds, posing threats to life and property. The coupled fire-atmosphere interactions that govern the behavior of pyroCb are incompletely understood, with previous simulations either treating the fire as static or using semi-empirical rate of spread models. It is disputed whether fuel moisture serves as an energy source or sink for pyroCB events. We use a fine-scale cloud model coupled with a fire model with combustion physics to simulate and analyze the co-evolution of pyroCb and its associated fire. Here we show fuel moisture acts as an energy sink attenuating fire intensity and suppressing pyroCb development, and we also identify and quantify a positive feedback loop, the self-amplifying fire-induced recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire. Our results demonstrate fuel moisture is an insignificant source of moisture for the pyroCb, contradicting previous forecasting guidance. Our analysis of the SAFIR mechanism shows weak upper-level winds favor a pyroCb downdraft close to the parent fire, creating conditions for rapid intensification. These findings provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding pyroCb behavior, offering insight towards improved prediction of these extreme events.</description>

      <title>Scaling particle-size segregation in wide-ranging sheared granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling relationships have been proposed to describe shear-driven size segregation based on intruder experiments and simulations. While these models have shown agreement with experimental and numerical results under uniform shear rate, their validity across varying shear-rate conditions remains uncertain. Here, we employ Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to investigate particle size segregation in sheared granular flows under wide-ranging shear-rate conditions. We find that the scaling between segregation velocity and local rheological conditions holds only within a moderate inertial number range ($0.01 &lt; I &lt; 0.1$), and breaks down in both quasi-static and collisional regimes. Furthermore, we show that this discrepancy leads continuum models to mispredict segregation rates in bidisperse mixtures. These findings emphasize the need for more generalized scaling laws capable of capturing segregation dynamics across a broader spectrum of shear-rate conditions and regimes.</description>

      <title>Structure and flow of low-dimensional water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water, a subject of human fascination for millennia, is likely the most studied substance on Earth, with an entire scientific field -- hydrodynamics -- dedicated to understanding water in motion. However, when water flows through one-dimensional or two-dimensional channels, its behavior deviates substantially from the principles of hydrodynamics. This is because reducing the dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction effects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. In low-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water molecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid but also like a solid in certain respects. In this review, we explore the relationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in low-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as benchmarks. We also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches available for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily influenced by the molecular structure of water.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Free Boundary Model for Two-Phase Flows in an Evolving Domain with Moving Contact Lines, Variable Contact Angles and Bulk-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent model, which describes the time evolution of a two-phase flow in an evolving domain. The movement of the free boundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the bulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take interactions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two materials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as those in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by respective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard equation. This approach allows for a transfer of material between bulk and surface as well as variable contact angles between the diffuse interface in the bulk and the boundary of the domain. To provide a more accurate description of the corresponding contact line motion, we include a generalized Navier slip boundary condition on the velocity field. We derive our model from scratch by considering local mass balance and energy dissipation laws. Finally, the derivation is completed via the Langrange multiplier approach. We further show that our model generalizes previous models from the literature, which can be recovered from our system by either dropping the dynamic boundary conditions or assuming a static boundary of the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formula for the local acoustical admittance in a conical waveguide with viscous and thermal losses given by Nederveen [(1969) Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments (Frits Knuf, Amsterdam)] is rewritten as an impedance transmission matrix. Based on a self-consistent approximation for the cone, it differs from other one-dimensional transmission matrices used in musical acoustics, which implicitly include the loss model of a cylinder. The resonance frequencies of air columns calculated with this transmission matrix are in better agreement with more comprehensive models. Even for long cones with a slight taper, there is no need to discretize along the axis.</description>

      <title>Large-eddy simulation of turbulent spray flames: Effects of scalar correlation and enthalpy reduction in flamelet modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of turbulent spray combustion provides a promising tool for advanced engine design. In spray flames, the droplet evaporation not only reduces the ambient gas temperature, but also influences flame structure by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation-induced specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid grid convergence and good feasibility. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates $\widetilde{Z}$ and dilutes reaction products, whereas chemical reactions enhance $\widetilde{c}$ fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>

Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, $\textit{Ra} \approx 31.8 \,\textit{Ta}^{1/2} - 4.43 \,\textit{Ta}^{5/12} + \mathcal{O}(\textit{Ta}^{1/3})$ for no-slip boundaries. However, we find that the linear onset in a finite cylinder differs noticeably compared to a Cartesian channel. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained patchy turbulence in shear-thinning active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial suspensions and other active fluids are known to develop highly dynamical vortex states, denoted as active or mesoscale turbulence. We reveal the pronounced effect of non-Newtonian rheological conditions on these turbulent states, concentrating on shear thinning. A self-sustained heterogeneous state of coexisting turbulent and quiescent areas develops, which results in anomalous velocity statistics. The heterogeneous state emerges in a hysteretic transition when varying activity. We provide an extensive numerical analysis and observe features consistent with a directed percolation transition. Our results are important, for instance, when addressing active objects in biological media with complex rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filter for Data Assimilation coupled with low-resolution computations techniques applied in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the "True" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</description>
