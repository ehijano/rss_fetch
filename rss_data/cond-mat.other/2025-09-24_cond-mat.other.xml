      <title>Spin-Axis Dynamic Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-electric realization of high spin polarization and efficient charge-to-spin remains a fundamental challenge in spintronics. We report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that enables fully spin-polarized axial currents: an inplane electric field along one axis drives a pure spin-up current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates a pure spin-down current. Notably, a diagonal field produces a pure transverse spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. This originates from extremely anisotropic sublattice hopping in a 2D altermagnetic lattice, forming a "tent state" with flat bands and orthogonal Fermi contours. Our firstprinciples calculations demonstrate SADL in a broad class of altermagnetic semiconductors (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and synthesized 3D (BaF)2Mn2Se2O crystal). These materials provide ideal platforms for gate-tunable, all-electrical spintronics, enabling reconfigurable devices whose spin state is controlled solely by the orientation of an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Magnon-photon coupling in the YIG-based disk and ring microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric quantum oscillations and Zeeman splitting in topological Dirac semimetal BaAl$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional topological semimetals hosting Dirac or Weyl fermions are a new kind of materials class in which conduction and valence bands cross each other. Such materials harbor a nontrivial Berry phase, which is an additional geometrical phase factor arising along the path of an adiabatic surface and can give rise to experimentally measurable quantities such as an anomalous Hall component. Here we report a systematic study of quantum oscillations of thermoelectric power in single crystals of the topological Dirac nodal-line semimetal BaAl$_{4}$. We show that the thermoelectric power (TEP) is a sensitive probe of the multiple oscillation frequencies in this material, with two of these frequencies shown to originate from the three-dimensional Dirac band. The detected Berry phase provides evidence of the angular dependence and non-trivial state under high magnetic fields. We also have probed the signatures of Zeeman splitting, from which we have extracted the Land\'e $g$-factor for this system, providing further insight into the non-trivial topology of this family of materials.</description>

      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>
