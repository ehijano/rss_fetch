      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>

      <title>Fractional Divisibility of Spheres with Partially Generic Sets of Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that an r-tuple $(g_1,...,g_r)$ of special orthogonal $d\times d$ matrices fractionally divides the $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere $S$ if there is a non-constant function in $L^2(S)$ such that its translations by $g_1,...,g_r$ sum up to the constant-1 function. Our main result shows, informally speaking, that fractional divisibility is impossible if at least $r/2$ rotations are ``generic".</description>

      <title>The algorithmic Fried Potato Problem in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conway's Fried Potato Problem seeks to determine the best way to cut a convex body in $n$ parts by $n-1$ hyperplane cuts (with the restriction that the $i$-th cut only divides in two one of the parts obtained so far), in a way as to minimize the maxuimum of the inradii of the parts. It was shown by Bezdek and Bezdek that the solution is always attained by $n-1$ parallel cuts. But the algorithmic problem of finding the best direction for these parallel cuts remains.
  In this note we show that for a convex $m$-gon $P$, this direction (and hence the cuts themselves) can be found in time $O(m \log^4 m)$, which improves on a quadratic algorithm proposed by Ca\~nete-Fern\'andez-M\'arquez (DMD 2022). Our algorithm first preprocesses what we call the dome (closely related to the medial axis) of $P$ using a variant of the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy, so that linear programs in the dome and in slices of it can be solved in polylogarithmic time.</description>

      <title>Intersection density and visibility for Boolean models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Poisson particle processes in hyperbolic space we introduce and study concepts analogous to the intersection density and the mean visible volume, which were originally considered in the analysis of Boolean models in Euclidean space. In particular, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the finiteness of the mean visible volume of a Boolean model in terms of the intensity and the mean surface area of the typical grain.</description>

      <title>Stable cylinders and fine structures for hyperbolic groups and curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1995, Rips and Sela asked if torsionfree hyperbolic groups admit globally stable cylinders. We establish this property for all residually finite hyperbolic groups and curve graphs of finite-type surfaces. These cylinders are fine objects, and the core of our approach is to upgrade the hyperbolic space to one with improved fine properties via a generalisation of Sageev's construction. The methods also let us prove that curve graphs of surfaces admit equivariant quasiisometric embeddings in finite products of quasitrees.</description>

      <title>Hypercube minor-universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph \( G \) is said to be \( m \)-minor-universal if every graph with at most \( m \) edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of \( G \). We prove that the \( d \)-dimensional hypercube, \( Q_d \), is \( \Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right) \)-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant \( C \) such that \( Q_d \) is not \( \frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}} \)-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>

      <title>Universal optimality of $T$-avoiding spherical codes and designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an open set (a union of open intervals), $T\subset [-1,1]$ we introduce the concepts of $T$-avoiding spherical codes and designs, that is, spherical codes that have no inner products in the set $T$. We show that certain codes found in the minimal vectors of the Leech lattices, as well as the minimal vectors of the Barnes--Wall lattice and codes derived from strongly regular graphs, are universally optimal in the restricted class of $T$-avoiding codes. We also extend a result of Delsarte--Goethals--Seidel about codes with three inner products $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ (in our terminology $(\alpha,\beta)$-avoiding $\gamma$-codes). Parallel to the notion of tight spherical designs, we also derive that these codes are minimal (tight) $T$-avoiding spherical designs of fixed dimension and strength. In some cases, we also find that codes under consideration have maximal cardinality in their $T$-avoiding class for given dimension and minimum distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem whether regular polygons and cycle graphs can be identified by the magnitude or the discrete Riesz energy. We give a positive answer when the number of vertices $n$ is small and a negative answer when $n$ is even and $n\ge6$ by giving a way to construct non-isometric spaces with the same magnitude or the discrete Riesz energy.</description>

      <title>Linear and Sublinear Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversities are an extension of the concept of a metric space, where a non-negative value is assigned to every finite set of points, rather than just pairs. A general theory of diversities has been developed which exhibits many deep analogies to metric space theory but also veers off in new directions. Just as many of the most important aspects of metric space theory involve metrics defined on $\Re^k$, many applications of diversity theory require a specialized theory for diversities defined on $\Re^k$, as we develop here. We focus on two fundamental classes of diversities defined on $\Re^k$: those that are Minkowski linear and those that are Minkowski sublinear. Many well-known functions in convex analysis belong to these classes, including diameter, circumradius and mean width. We derive surprising characterizations of these classes, and establish elegant connections between them. Motivated by classical results in metric geometry, and connections with combinatorial optimization, we then examine embeddability of finite diversities into $\Re^k$. We prove that a finite diversity can be embedded into a linear diversity exactly when it has negative type and that it can be embedded into a sublinear diversity exactly when it corresponds to a generalized circumradius.</description>
