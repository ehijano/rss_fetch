      <title>A reconstruction algorithm of electrical impedance tomography based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a novel computational imaging technology. In order to improve the quality and spatial resolution of the reconstructed images, the G-CNN and HG-CNN algorithms are proposed based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) in this paper. The input of the 1D-CNN is the reconstructed conductivity distribution obtained by the GVSPM algorithm or the H-GVSPM algorithm. The reconstructed images with higher resolution are obtained through the calculation of 1D-CNN. Finally, the Hadamard product is applied to calculate the output of the 1D-CNN. In the simulation results of the lung cross-section models, the correlation coefficients of the G-CNN algorithm and HG-CNN algorithm maximumly are 2.52 times and 2.20 times greater than the GVSPM algorithm and H-GVSPM algorithm, respectively. In the results of the simulation and experiment, the reconstructed images of the G-CNN and HG-CNN algorithms are distortion-free. In addition, the artifacts of the reconstructed images are diminished after calculations of the Hadamard product. This research provides a reference method for improving the quality of the reconstructed images so that EIT is better applied in medical detection.</description>

      <title>Determining the utility of ultrafast nonlinear contrast enhanced and super resolution ultrasound for imaging microcirculation in the human small intestine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regulation of intestinal blood flow is critical to gastrointestinal function. Imaging the intestinal mucosal micro-circulation in vivo has the potential to provide new insight into the gut physiology and pathophysiology. We aimed to determine whether ultrafast contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and super-resolution ultrasound localisation microscopy (SRUS/ULM) could be a useful tool for imaging the small intestine microcirculation in vivo non-invasively and for detecting changes in blood flow in the duodenum. Ultrafast CEUS and SRUS/ULM were used to image the small intestinal microcirculation in a cohort of 20 healthy volunteers (BMI&lt;25). Participants were imaged while conscious and either having been fasted, or following ingestion of a liquid meal or water control, or under acute stress. For the first time we have performed ultrafast CEUS and ULM on the human small intestine, providing unprecedented resolution images of the intestinal microcirculation. We evaluated flow speed inside small vessels in healthy volunteers (2.78 +/- 0.05 mm/s, mean +/- SEM) and quantified changes in the perfusion of this microcirculation in response to nutrient ingestion. Perfusion of the microvasculature of the intestinal mucosa significantly increased post-prandially (36.2% +/- 12.2%, mean +/- SEM, p&lt;0.05). The feasibility of 3D SRUS/ULM was also demonstrated. This study demonstrates the potential utility of ultrafast CEUS for assessing perfusion and detecting changes in blood flow in the duodenum. SRUS/ULM also proved a useful tool to image the microvascular blood flow in vivo non-invasively and to evaluate blood speed inside the microvasculature of the human small intestine.</description>

      <title>Controlling spatial correlation in k-space interpolation networks for MRI reconstruction: denoising versus apparent blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To improve the interpretability of noise amplification and apparent blurring of k-space interpolation networks, and to optimize for them in the loss function as a model-based regularizer in k-space interpolation networks.
  Methods: Network is subjected to noise amplification analysis through automatic differentiation of the input with respect to the input. Noise variance maps are decomposed into terms accounting for the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the network. Variance maps are derived in each iteration, allowing for runtime quality monitoring. Maximum variance (eigenpixel) and residual variance maps (pixel contamination) are introduced, which describe the network noise amplification and apparent blurring, respectively. By including the variance maps in the training, the loss function is enriched with a model-based regularizer beyond the k-space data consistency term. Accordingly, the proposed g-factor-informed RAKI (GIF-RAKI) establishes a recurrent flow of noise and apparent blurring information into the training, that drives the denoising via the trainable nonlinear activation function.
  Results: GIF-RAKI outperforms other RAKI implementations, supported by difference maps, and image quality metrics. Eigenpixel and pixel contamination maps provide quantitative metrics for noise amplification and apparent blurring, respectively, without the need for a gold standard reference. RAKI with tuneable Leaky ReLU is capable of adjusting its own nonlinearity automatically.
  Conclusion: The additional model-based loss terms allow to optimize for the trade-off between denoising and apparent blurring during RAKI training. This has the potential to eliminate the need for heuristic hyperparameter tweaking.</description>

      <title>Novel Direct Alpha Spectroscopy Technique for $^{225}$Ac Radiopharmaceutical detection in Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) employs alpha-emitting radionuclides conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules to deliver localized radiation to cancer cells, showing great promise in treating metastatic cancers. Among these radionuclides, Actinium-225 ($^{225}$Ac, t$_{1/2}$ = 9.9 days) has emerged as a clinically promising candidate. Its decay chain generates four successive alpha emissions, resulting in highly localized and effective cytotoxic damage to cancer cells when delivered to tumor sites. However, the assumption of complete retention of $^{225}$Ac and its radioactive daughters at these target sites is often inaccurate. The nuclear recoil effect can lead to off-target distribution and unintended toxicity.
  Our results revealed distinct spectral differences between radiolabeled cells and reference samples, demonstrating [$^{225}$Ac]Ac-crown-TATE uptake by AR42J cells. Detection of $^{213}$Po, one of the $^{225}$Ac decay daughters, highlighted partial retention and release of decay products from cells, providing information on intracellular retention and daughter redistribution. Geant4 simulations confirmed the alignment of experimental data with theoretical models, validating the method's accuracy. This study establishes a direct alpha spectroscopy approach for investigating $^{225}$Ac and its daughters' behavior in cells and offers a powerful tool for microdosimetry estimation.</description>

      <title>Output correction factors in a 1.5 T magnetic field determined at the central axis and at the lateral dose maximum for five detectors using alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using 4 detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 2.5x2.5cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>
