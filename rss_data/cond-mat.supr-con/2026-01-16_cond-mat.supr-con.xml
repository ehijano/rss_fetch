      <title>Spatially resolved collective modes in d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dispersion of collective modes in a superconductor with $d-$wave symmetry of the order parameter in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction. We use diagrammatic technique and quasiclassical theory in Keldysh-Nambu formalism to compute longitudinal and transverse pair susceptibilities and extract from them the dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse collective mode. We show that at T=0, the dispersion of the transverse (plasma) mode is the same as in an s-wave superconductor, but at a finite temperature it is softer and has a much larger decay rate due to the partial screening of the Coulomb potential by nodal quasiparticles. We show that the dispersion of the longitudinal mode depends on the direction of momentum with respect to the positions of the nodes of the d-wave gap, while the decay rate of this mode does not depend on momentum. We discuss experimental implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient superconducting diode effect in unconventional $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of superconducting phases, both with zero and finite Cooper-pair center of mass momenta, in recently proposed unconventional $p$-wave magnets. As a consequence, we find that, while these magnetic phases are in principle compatible with a conventional pairing state at zero field, a Fulde-Ferrell phase can generally be promoted as the leading instability under the application of a finite magnetic field. Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Multiple Andreev Reflection Effects in Asymmetric STM Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have examined the electrical behavior of Josephson junctions formed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a Nb sample and a Nb tip, with normal-state resistances Rn varying between 1 kOhm and 10 MOhm. Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low magnetization and hysteresis loss in APC Nb3Sn superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the accelerator magnets of the next hadron collider, reducing superconductor persistent-current magnetization is not only important for achieving the desired field quality, but also crucial for its sustainability because the magnetization loss is the major heat load to the magnet cold mass. For conventional Nb3Sn conductors this requires reduction of effective subelement size (Deff). For the restacked-rod-process (RRP) conductors a physical subelement size (Dsub) as small as 35 um (corresponding to a Deff close to 45 um) can be reached, but at a significant price in Jc. Another way to reduce the magnetization is by introducing artificial pinning centers (APC) using the internal oxidation approach. APC conductors outperform conventional Nb3Sn wires in two aspects: 1) higher Jc at high fields, and 2) much lower Jc and magnetization at low fields (e.g., below 5 T). In this work we explored the fabricability of APC wires with small Dsub. A 180-stack APC wire was produced and drawn to 0.7- and 0.5-mm diameters with good quality, with Dsubs of 34 and 24 um (Deffs of 36 and 25 um), respectively. For the 34-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc is higher than that of an RRP wire used for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project above 13 T (e.g., 36% higher at 4.2 K, 18 T), while its non-Cu magnetization at 1 T, {\Delta}M(1 T), is only 29% of the RRP wire. Its non-Cu hysteresis loss for a cycle between 1 and 14 T, Qh(1-14 T), is 37% of the RRP wire. For the 24-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc surpasses the HL-LHC RRP wire above 17.5 T, while its {\Delta}M(1 T) and Qh(1-14 T) are only 17% and 23% of the RRP wire, respectively. Its non-Cu Qh(+/-3 T) even meets the specification of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure theory of H$_{3}$S: Plane-wave-like valence states, density-of-states peak and its guaranteed proximity to the Fermi level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.</description>

      <title>Microwave Kerr/Faraday Resonance in Two-dimensional Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polar Kerr and Faraday effects in two-dimensional multiband chiral superconductors. We show that the clapping modes--the relative phase and amplitude oscillations between two chiral components of the superconducting order parameter--lie well within the quasiparticle excitation gap in multiband systems and dominate these magneto-optical responses in the microwave regime. The Kerr and Faraday rotation angles exhibit the resonant enhancement with sign reversals in the microwave regime as a function of the light frequency, reaching peak values on the order of 100 nrad--10 $\mu$rad in thin films of candidate chiral superconductors. These resonances are accessible in superconducting atomic layer materials and provide a generic probe of chiral superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Growth and hydrostatic-pressure study of a type-II superconductor Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$ single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the growth and physical properties of single-crystalline Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$ crystallizing in $P6_3/mcm$ space group, which comprises alternating Ta-S layers and Bi layers with each Bi atom connected with adjacent S atoms. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity measurements reveal a superconducting transition at 0.84 K, with upper critical field 231 Oe under an out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetization measurements confirm its nature as a type-II superconductor, with anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa_{ab}$ = 7.67 and $\kappa_c$ = 4.50. Hall measurements indicate the dominant carriers as hole. Hydrostatic pressure is applied, under which both the superconducting transition temperature and upper critical field increase sharply under low pressure before undergoing slight suppression under higher pressure. Density functional theory calculations reveal non-trivial topological surface states on (100) surface in Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$, which may offer a new avenue for exploring potential topological superconductivity in layered transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Effects of Integrated Heatsinking on Superconductivity in Tantalum Nitride Nanowires at the 300 Millimeter Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the superconducting properties of tantalum nitride (TaN) nanowires and TaN/copper (TaN/Cu) bilayer nanowires fabricated on 300 mm silicon wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. We evaluate how an integrated Cu heatsink modifies the superconducting response of TaN nanowires by improving thermal dissipation without significantly compromising key superconducting parameters. Through analysis of hysteresis in current-voltage curves, we demonstrate that Cu integration improves heat dissipation, supporting expectations of faster reset times in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), consistent with enhanced heat transfer away from the hot spot. Using the Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham (SBT) hotspot model, we quantify the Cu-enabled improvement in heat transfer as an approximately 100x increase in the SBT slope parameter beta and effective interfacial heat-transfer efficiency compared to TaN nanowires. The near-unity ratio of critical to retrapping current in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires provides another evidence of efficient heat removal enabled by the integrated Cu layer. Our results show a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 7 nm and a critical temperature of 4.1 K for 39 nm thick TaN nanowires. The nanowires show &lt;5% variation in critical dimensions, room-temperature resistance, residual resistance ratio, critical temperature, and critical current across the 300 mm wafer for all measured linewidths, demonstrating excellent process uniformity and scalability. These results indicate the trade-offs between superconducting performance and heat-sinking efficiency in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires. They also underscore the viability of wafer-scale fabrication for fast, large-area SNSPD arrays for applications in photonic quantum computing, cosmology, and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Density, Penetration Depth, Condensate Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fascination with the concept of superconducting (SC) {\it superfluid density} $\rho_s$ has persisted since the beginning of superconductivity theory, with numerical values of an actual density rarely provided. Over time $\rho_s$, addressed mostly in cuprate and following high temperature superconductors, has become synonymous with the normalized (unitless) inverse square of the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_L$ (the London expression, with superfluid density denoted $n_s$), with interest primarily on its temperature $T$ dependence that is expected to reflect the T-dependence of the SC gap amplitude and gap symmetry. In conventional superconductors, generalized expressions from the London penetration depth via Ginzburg-Landau theory, then to BCS theory provide updated pictures of the supercurrent density-vector potential relationship. The BCS value $\lambda_{band}$ is distinct from any particle density, instead involving particle availability at the Fermi surface and Fermi velocity as the determining factors, thus providing a basis for a more fundamental theory and understanding of what is being probed in penetration depth studies. The number density of superconducting electrons ${\cal N}_s(T$=0) -- the scalar SC {\it condensate density} -- is provided, first from a phenomenological estimate but then supported by BCS theory. A straightforward relation connecting ${\cal N}_s(0)$ to the density of dynamically transporting carriers in the normal state at $T_c$ is obtained. Numerical values of relevant material parameters including $\lambda_{band}$ and ${\cal N}_s$ are provided for a few conventional SCs.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid in a half-filled Chern band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.</description>

      <title>Incipient modulated phase in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometer-scale modulations can spontaneously emerge in complex materials when multiple degrees of freedom interact. Here we demonstrate that ferroelectric Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ lies in close proximity to an incipient structurally modulated phase. Using inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering, we show that upon cooling, dipolar fluctuations strongly couple to and soften the $c_{44}$ transverse acoustic mode. We identify the wavevector at which this softening is maximal, thereby defining the characteristic length scale of the modulation. Calcium substitution enhances both the amplitude and the wavevector of the softening by strengthening the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear flexoelectric phonon coupling tends to stabilize a modulated state that cooperates with, rather than competes against, the other lattice instabilities in SrTiO$_3$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, topological superconductors have emerged as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics, owing to the exotic properties of Majorana quasiparticles residing on edges, surfaces, and vortex cores. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional s+p wave noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on a cylindrical manifold. By employing a thin-layer quantization approach, we derive the effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian to elucidate the interplay between surface curvature and topological phase transitions. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the curvature-induced geometric potential (da Costa potential) and the spatial reconfiguration of spin-momentum locking effectively modulate the superconducting gap. From a band theory perspective, we confirm that curvature serves as a critical tuning parameter, capable of driving topological phase transitions by inducing band inversion.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report direct, simultaneous measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Two depth-resolved techniques - low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) - were used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ values, accurately quantified at the nanoscale, are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, and indicate that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

      <title>Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three-dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</description>
