      <title>Kirby diagrams, trisections and gems of PL 4-manifolds: relationships, results and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the main achievements regarding the interactions between gem theory (which makes use of edge-colored graphs to represent PL-manifolds of arbitrary dimension) and both the classical representation of PL 4-manifolds via Kirby diagrams and the more recent one via trisections. Original results also appear (in particular, about gems representing closed 4-manifolds which need 3-handles in their handle decomposition, as well as about trisection diagrams), together with open problems and further possible applications to the study of compact PL 4-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many pairwise non-isotopic splitting spheres for two unlinked, unknotted $S^2$'s in $S^4$. This answers a question posed by Hughes, Kim, and Miller.</description>

      <title>Computing Heegaard Floer invariants of closed contact 3-manifolds from open books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two SageMath programs that build on and improve upon Sucharit Sarkar's hf-hat. Given an abstract open book and a collection of pairwise disjoint properly embedded arcs on a page of the open book, the first program, hf-hat-obd, can be used to analyze the resulting Heegaard diagram, while the second, hf-hat-obd-nice computes the hat version of Heegaard Floer homology of the closed oriented 3-manifold described by the Heegaard diagram as long as the latter is nice. We also provide an auxiliary program, makenice, that can be used to produce a nice Heegaard diagram out of any abstract open book and a collection of pairwise disjoint properly embedded arcs on a page of the open book. The primary applications of hf-hat-obd-nice are to the computation of the Ozsv\'ath--Szab\'o contact invariant and to the detection of finiteness of spectral order, which is a Stein fillability obstruction that is stronger than the vanishing of the Ozsv\'ath--Szab\'o contact invariant.</description>

      <title>Free Semigroups of Large Critical Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a convergence group equipped with an expanding coarse-cocycle, we construct finitely generated free subsemigroups, which we call $\textit{Bishop--Jones}$ $\textit{semigroups}$, of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than the critical exponent of the ambient group. As an application, we show that for any lattice in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, there exist finitely generated free subsemigroups of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient lattice. This shows no critical exponent gap for discrete subsemigroups in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, which is in contrast with Corlette's renowned gap theorem concerning infinite co-volume discrete subgroups of these rank one Lie groups. More generally, we prove that for any non-elementary transverse subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$, there exist finitely generated free Anosov subsemigroups in the sense of Kassel--Potrie of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient transverse group. Furthermore, we show that these semigroups admit $\mathcal{C}$-regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X$ of $G$, in the sense of Dey--Kim--Oh.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which, we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups and fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic. In addition, we obtain characterizations of $C^*$-simplicity for Generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Reversible and other generalised torsion elements in Seifert-fibered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An element $a$ in a group $\Gamma$ is called \emph{reversible} if there exists $g \in \Gamma$ such that $gag^{-1}=a^{-1}$. The reversible elements are also known as `real elements' or `reciprocal elements' in literature. In this paper, we classify the reversible elements in Fuchsian groups, and use this classification to find all reversible elements in a Seifert-fibered group. We then apply the classification to the braid groups, particularly to the braid group on $3$ strands. We further study generalised 3-torsion elements in PSL(2,Z), and use this to analyse the existence of generalised 3-torsion elements in Seifert-fibered spaces in general, and braid groups on 3 strands in particular.</description>

      <title>Patterns of the $V_2$-polynomial of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank 2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology. This is an updated version with links to data files.</description>

      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups. Part I: Uniform upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgroups of direct products of finitely many finitely generated free groups form a natural class that plays an important role in geometric group theory. Its members include fundamental examples, such as the Stallings-Bieri groups. This raises the problem of understanding their geometric invariants. We prove that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of three free groups, as well as subgroups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ in a direct product of $n$ free groups, have Dehn function bounded above by $N^9$. This gives a positive answer to a question of Dison within these important subclasses and provides new insights in the context of Bridson's conjecture stating that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of free groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. To prove our results we generalise techniques for "pushing fillings" into normal subgroups.</description>
