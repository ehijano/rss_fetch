      <title>Skewness of a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent work on confidence intervals for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling found a surprising result: ordinary Student $t$ 95\% confidence intervals based on a modest number of replicates were seen to be very effective and even more reliable than some bootstrap $t$ intervals that were expected to be best. One potential explanation is that those RQMC estimates have small skewness. In this paper we give conditions under which the skewness is $O(n^\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, so `almost $O(1)$'. Under a random generator matrix model, we can improve this rate to $O(n^{-1/2+\epsilon})$ with very high probability. We also improve some probabilistic bounds on the distribution of the quality parameter $t$ for a digital net in a prime base under random sampling of generator matrices.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Forecasting high-dimensional functional time series with dual-factor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dual-factor model for high-dimensional functional time series (HDFTS) that considers multiple populations. The HDFTS is first decomposed into a collection of functional time series (FTS) in a lower dimension and a group of population-specific basis functions. The system of basis functions describes cross-sectional heterogeneity, while the reduced-dimension FTS retains most of the information common to multiple populations. The low-dimensional FTS is further decomposed into a product of common functional loadings and a matrix-valued time series that contains the most temporal dynamics embedded in the original HDFTS. The proposed general-form dual-factor structure is connected to several commonly used functional factor models. We demonstrate the finite-sample performances of the proposed method in recovering cross-sectional basis functions and extracting common features using simulated HDFTS. An empirical study shows that the proposed model produces more accurate point and interval forecasts for subnational age-specific mortality rates in Japan. The financial benefits associated with the improved mortality forecasts are translated into a life annuity pricing scheme.</description>
