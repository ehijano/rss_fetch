      <title>Schwinger vs Unruh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the temperatures which characterise the Unruh effect, the Gibbons-Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the Hawking radiation from the black hole horizon acquire the extra factor 2 compared with their traditional values. The reason for that is the coherence of different processes. The combination of the coherent processes also allows us to make the connection between the Schwinger pair production and the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Reprogrammable sequencing for physically intelligent under-actuated robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming physical intelligence into mechanisms holds great promise for machines that can accomplish tasks such as navigation of unstructured environments while utilizing a minimal amount of computational resources and electronic components. In this study, we introduce a novel design approach for physically intelligent under-actuated mechanisms capable of autonomously adjusting their motion in response to environmental interactions. Specifically, multistability is harnessed to sequence the motion of different degrees of freedom in a programmed order. A key aspect of this approach is that these sequences can be passively reprogrammed through mechanical stimuli that arise from interactions with the environment. To showcase our approach, we construct a four degree of freedom robot capable of autonomously navigating mazes and moving away from obstacles. Remarkably, this robot operates without relying on traditional computational architectures and utilizes only a single linear actuator.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Post-Glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>
