      <title>State Dependent Spread Complexity Dynamics in Many-Body Localization Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Many-Body Localization (MBL) phase transition using the dynamics of spread complexity and inverse participation ratio in the Krylov space starting from different initial states. Our analysis of the disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain unravels that the ergodic-to-MBL transition can be determined from the transition of the pre-saturation peak in the thermofield double state (TFD) spread complexity. On the other hand, if an initially ordered state or a superposition of a small number of such states is chosen, then the saturation value of spread complexity and Krylov inverse participation ratio (KIPR) can distinguish the ergodic phase from the integrable phases, with no sharp difference between the integrable phases. Interestingly, the distinction between the disorder-free integrable and the MBL integrable phase is established by the spread complexity study of random states chosen from unitary and orthogonal Haar ensembles. We also study the complexity dynamics by coupling the system to a bath, which shows distinctive profiles in different phases. A stretched exponential decay of KIPR is observed when the MBL system is connected to the bath, with the decay starting at an earlier time for a greater value of environmental dephasing. Our work sheds light on the efficacy of Krylov space dynamics in understanding phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Maze: A System With Tunable Scale Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random magnetic field configurations are ubiquitous in nature. Such fields lead to a variety of dynamical phenomena, including localization and glassy physics in some condensed matter systems and novel transport processes in astrophysical systems. Here we consider the physics of a charged quantum particle moving in a ``magnetic maze'': a high-dimensional space filled with a randomly chosen vector potential and a corresponding magnetic field. We derive a path integral description of the model by introducing appropriate collective variables and integrating out the random vector potential, and we solve for the dynamics in the limit of large dimensionality. We derive and analyze the equations of motion for Euclidean and real-time dynamics, and we calculate out-of-time-order correlators. We show that a special choice of vector potential correlations gives rise, in the low temperature limit, to a novel scale-invariant quantum theory with a tunable dynamical exponent. Moreover, we show that the theory is chaotic with a tunable chaos exponent which approaches the chaos bound at low temperature and strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Topological communities in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most complex systems can be captured by graphs or networks. Networks connect nodes (e.g.\ neurons) through edges (synapses), thus summarizing the system's structure. A popular way of interrogating graphs is community detection, which uncovers sets of geometrically related nodes. {\em Geometric communities} consist of nodes ``closer'' to each other than to others in the graph. Some network features do not depend on node proximity -- rather, on them playing similar roles (e.g.\ building bridges) even if located far apart. These features can thus escape proximity-based analyses. We lack a general framework to uncover such features. We introduce {\em topological communities}, an alternative perspective to decomposing graphs. We find clusters that describe a network as much as classical communities, yet are missed by current techniques. In our framework, each graph guides our attention to its relevant features, whether geometric or topological. Our analysis complements existing ones, and could be a default method to study networks confronted without prior knowledge. Classical community detection has bolstered our understanding of biological, neural, or social systems; yet it is only half the story. Topological communities promise deep insights on a wealth of available data. We illustrate this for the global airport network, human connectomes, and others.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Power-grid modelling via gradual improvement of parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of electric power systems are widely studied through the phase synchronization of oscillators, typically with the use of the Kuramoto equation. While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how gradual improvement of power grid models affect the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying level of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. The most heterogeneous models showed very low synchronization and thus suggest a limitation of the second-order Kuramoto equation. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method is applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an n-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Unifying View of Fermionic Neural Network Quantum States: From Neural Network Backflow to Hidden Fermion Determinant States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r \times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</description>

      <title>Low-resolution descriptions of model neural activity reveal hidden features and underlying system properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of complex systems such as neural networks is made particularly difficult by the overwhelming number of their interacting components. In the absence of prior knowledge, identifying a small but informative subset of network nodes on which the analysis should focus is a rather challenging task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of a Hopfield model, which is observed through the lenses of low-resolution representations, or decimation mappings, consisting of subgroups of its neurons. The optimal, most informative mappings of the network are defined through a recently developed methodology, the mapping entropy optimisation workflow (MEOW), which performs an unsupervised analysis of the states sampled by the network and identifies those subgroups of spins whose configuration distribution is closest to that of the full, high-resolution model. Which neurons are retained in an optimal mapping is found to critically depend on the properties of the interaction matrix of the network and the level of detail employed to describe the system; by these means, it is thus possible to extract quantitative insight about the underlying properties of the high-resolution model through the analysis of its optimal low-resolution representations. These results show a tight and potentially fruitful relation between the level of detail at which the network is inspected and the type and amount of information that can be gathered from it, and showcase the MEOW approach as a practical, enabling tool for the study of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Large time effective kinetics $\beta$-functions for quantum (2+p)-spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the lens of renormalization group (RG) theory. The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue distribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our investigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average action, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due to the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in the effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the formulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of perturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop $\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$, $p=\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With qubits encoded into atomic ground and Rydberg states and situated on the vertexes of a graph, the conditional quantum dynamics of Rydberg blockade, which inhibits simultaneous excitation of nearby atoms, has been employed recently to find maximum independent sets following an adiabatic evolution algorithm hereafter denoted by HV [Science 376, 1209 (2022)]. An alternative algorithm, short named the PK algorithm, reveals that the independent sets diffuse over a media graph governed by a non-abelian gauge matrix of an emergent PXP model. This work shows the above two algorithms are mathematically equivalent, despite of their seemingly different physical implementations. More importantly, we demonstrated that although the two are mathematically equivalent, the PK algorithm exhibits more efficient and resource-saving performance. Within the same range of experimental parameters, our numerical studies suggest that the PK algorithm performs at least 25% better on average and saves at least $6\times10^6$ measurements ($\sim 900$ hours of continuous operation) for each graph when compared to the HV algorithm. We further consider the measurement error and point out that this may cause the oscillations in the performance of the HV's optimization process.</description>
