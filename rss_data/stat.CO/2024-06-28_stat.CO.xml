      <title>Gratia: An R package for exploring generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs, Hastie &amp; Tibshirani, 1990; Wood, 2017) are an extension of the generalized linear model that allows the effects of covariates to be modelled as smooth functions. GAMs are increasingly used in many areas of science (e.g. Pedersen, Miller, Simpson, &amp; Ross, 2019; Simpson, 2018) because the smooth functions allow nonlinear relationships between covariates and the response to be learned from the data through the use of penalized splines. Within the R (R Core Team, 2024) ecosystem, Simon Wood's mgcv package (Wood, 2017) is widely used to fit GAMs and is a Recommended package that ships with R as part of the default install. A growing number of other R packages build upon mgcv, for example as an engine to fit specialised models not handled by mgcv itself (e.g. GJMR, Marra &amp; Radice, 2023), or to make use of the wide range of splines available in mgcv (e.g. brms, B\"urkner, 2017).
  The gratia package builds upon mgcv by providing functions that make working with GAMs easier. gratia takes a tidy approach (Wickham, 2014) providing ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) replacements for mgcv's base graphics-based plots, functions for model diagnostics and exploration of fitted models, and a family of functions for drawing samples from the posterior distribution of a fitted GAM. Additional functionality is provided to facilitate the teaching and understanding of GAMs.</description>

      <title>Exact confidence intervals for functions of parameters in the k-sample multinomial problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the target of inference is a real-valued function of probability parameters in the k-sample multinomial problem, variance estimation may be challenging. In small samples, methods like the nonparametric bootstrap or delta method may perform poorly. We propose a novel general method in this setting for computing exact p-values and confidence intervals which means that type I error rates are correctly bounded and confidence intervals have at least nominal coverage at all sample sizes. Our method is applicable to any real-valued function of multinomial probabilities, accommodating an arbitrary number of samples with varying category counts. We describe the method and provide an implementation of it in R, with some computational optimization to ensure broad applicability. Simulations demonstrate our method's ability to maintain correct coverage rates in settings where the nonparametric bootstrap fails.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Phenotypic Models of Cardiovascular Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Comorbidities: A Longitudinal Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are notably prevalent among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), posing unique challenges in predicting CVD progression due to the intricate interactions of comorbidities. Traditional models typically lack the necessary dynamic and longitudinal scope to accurately forecast CVD trajectories in OSA patients. This study introduces a novel multi-level phenotypic model to analyze the progression and interplay of these conditions over time, utilizing data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort, which includes 1,123 participants followed for decades. Our methodology comprises three advanced steps: (1) Conducting feature importance analysis through tree-based models to underscore critical predictive variables like total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and diabetes. (2) Developing a logistic mixed-effects model (LGMM) to track longitudinal transitions and pinpoint significant factors, which displayed a diagnostic accuracy of 0.9556. (3) Implementing t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) alongside Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to segment patient data into distinct phenotypic clusters that reflect varied risk profiles and disease progression pathways. This phenotypic clustering revealed two main groups, with one showing a markedly increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), underscored by the significant predictive role of nocturnal hypoxia and sympathetic nervous system activity from sleep data. Analysis of transitions and trajectories with t-SNE and GMM highlighted different progression rates within the cohort, with one cluster progressing more slowly towards severe CVD states than the other. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationship between CVD and OSA, providing valuable tools for predicting disease onset and tailoring treatment approaches.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Piecewise Deterministic Monte Carlo Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has suggested using Monte Carlo methods based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) to sample from target distributions of interest. PDMPs are non-reversible continuous-time processes endowed with momentum, and hence can mix better than standard reversible MCMC samplers. Furthermore, they can incorporate exact sub-sampling schemes which only require access to a single (randomly selected) data point at each iteration, yet without introducing bias to the algorithm's stationary distribution. However, the range of models for which PDMPs can be used, particularly with sub-sampling, is limited. We propose approximate simulation of PDMPs with sub-sampling for scalable sampling from posterior distributions. The approximation takes the form of an Euler approximation to the true PDMP dynamics, and involves using an estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior based on a data sub-sample. We thus call this class of algorithms stochastic-gradient PDMPs. Importantly, the trajectories of stochastic-gradient PDMPs are continuous and can leverage recent ideas for sampling from measures with continuous and atomic components. We show these methods are easy to implement, present results on their approximation error and demonstrate numerically that this class of algorithms has similar efficiency to, but is more robust than, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Semi-Parametric Inference for Doubly Stochastic Spatial Point Processes: An Approximate Penalized Poisson Likelihood Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doubly-stochastic point processes model the occurrence of events over a spatial domain as an inhomogeneous Poisson process conditioned on the realization of a random intensity function. They are flexible tools for capturing spatial heterogeneity and dependence. However, existing implementations of doubly-stochastic spatial models are computationally demanding, often have limited theoretical guarantee, and/or rely on restrictive assumptions. We propose a penalized regression method for estimating covariate effects in doubly-stochastic point processes that is computationally efficient and does not require a parametric form or stationarity of the underlying intensity. Our approach is based on an approximate (discrete and deterministic) formulation of the true (continuous and stochastic) intensity function. We show that consistency and asymptotic normality of the covariate effect estimates can be achieved despite the model misspecification, and develop a covariance estimator that leads to a valid, albeit conservative, statistical inference procedure. A simulation study shows the validity of our approach under less restrictive assumptions on the data generating mechanism, and an application to Seattle crime data demonstrates better prediction accuracy compared with existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Bayesian identification of nonseparable Hamiltonians with multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a structure-preserving Bayesian approach for learning nonseparable Hamiltonian systems using stochastic dynamic models allowing for statistically-dependent, vector-valued additive and multiplicative measurement noise. The approach is comprised of three main facets. First, we derive a Gaussian filter for a statistically-dependent, vector-valued, additive and multiplicative noise model that is needed to evaluate the likelihood within the Bayesian posterior. Second, we develop a novel algorithm for cost-effective application of Bayesian system identification to high-dimensional systems. Third, we demonstrate how structure-preserving methods can be incorporated into the proposed framework, using nonseparable Hamiltonians as an illustrative system class. We assess the method's performance based on the forecasting accuracy of a model estimated from-single trajectory data. We compare the Bayesian method to a state-of-the-art machine learning method on a canonical nonseparable Hamiltonian model and a chaotic double pendulum model with small, noisy training datasets. The results show that using the Bayesian posterior as a training objective can yield upwards of 724 times improvement in Hamiltonian mean squared error using training data with up to 10% multiplicative noise compared to a standard training objective. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the novel algorithm for parameter estimation of a 64-dimensional model of the spatially-discretized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with data corrupted by up to 20% multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>JAXbind: Bind any function to JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JAX is widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, the latter of which often relies on existing high-performance code that we would ideally like to incorporate into JAX. Reimplementing the existing code in JAX is often impractical and the existing interface in JAX for binding custom code either limits the user to a single Jacobian product or requires deep knowledge of JAX and its C++ backend for general Jacobian products. With JAXbind we drastically reduce the effort required to bind custom functions implemented in other programming languages with full support for Jacobian-vector products and vector-Jacobian products to JAX. Specifically, JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom, so-called JAX primitives. Via JAXbind, any function callable from Python can be exposed as a JAX primitive. JAXbind allows a user to interface the JAX function transformation engine with custom derivatives and batching rules, enabling all JAX transformations for the custom primitive.</description>
