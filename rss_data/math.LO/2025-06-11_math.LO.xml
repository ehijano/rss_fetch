      <title>The initial segment condition for $\kappa^+$-supercompactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a development of the fine structure of mice with long extenders, to the level of $\kappa^+$-supercompact cardinals $\kappa$. We do this using a hierarchy with features more analogous to those familiar in the short extender context than the hierarchies introduced by Woodin and by Neeman-Steel. In particular, the mice we consider satisfy stronger versions of the initial segment condition. We establish a form of fine structural condensation involving embeddings $\pi:H\to M$ which need not be the identity below the projectum of $H$ (under special assumptions). We also adapt the analysis of the Dodd structure of short extenders on the sequence to mice at this level.</description>

      <title>Correspondence Theory for Many-valued Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to generalise Sahlqvist correspondence theory to the many-valued modal semantics defined by Fitting, assuming a perfect Heyting algebra as truth value space. We present the standard translations between many-valued modal languages and suitably defined first-order and second-order correspondence languages and prove their correctness. We introduce a notion of many-valued modal frame correspondence with a truth value parameter. Exploring the consequences of this definition, we define many-valued analogues of the syntactically specified classes of Sahlqvist and inductive formulas. We adapt the ALBA algorithm to effectively compute many-valued parameterized local frame correspondents for all many-valued Sahlqvist and inductive formulas. Lastly we prove that the many-valued frame correspondent (parameterized with any non-zero truth value) of every classical Sahlqvist formula is syntactically identical to its standard crisp frame correspondent.</description>

      <title>Countable Ordered Groups and Weihrauch Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues to study the connection between reverse mathematics and Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we study the problems formed from Maltsev's theorem on the order types of countable ordered groups. Solomon showed that the theorem is equivalent to $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$, the strongest of the big five subsystems of second order arithmetic. We show that the strength of the theorem comes from having a dense linear order without endpoints in its order type. Then, we show that for the related Weihrauch problem to be strong enough to be equivalent to $\mathsf{\hat{WF}}$ (the analog problem of $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$), an order-preserving function is necessary in the output. Without the order-preserving function, the problems are very much to the side compared to analog problems of the big five.</description>

      <title>Properties preserved by classes of Chu transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chu spaces and Chu transforms were first investigated in category theory by Barr and Chu in 1979. In 2000 van Benthem shifted to the model-theoretic point of view by isolating a class of infinitary two-sorted properties, the flow formulas, which are preserved by all Chu transforms. D\v{z}amonja and V\"a\"an\"anen in 2021 considered a special kind of Chu transforms, satisfying a density condition. These authors used dense Chu transforms to compare abstract logics, in particular showing that such transforms preserve compactness.
  This motivates the problem of characterizing which properties are preserved by dense Chu transforms. We solve this problem by isolating the inconsistency-flow formulas, which are flow formulas with an added predicate to express inconsistency. Our main result characterizes the first-order inconsistency-flow formulas exactly as those first-order properties preserved by dense Chu transforms. Furthermore, we consider several instances of Chu transforms in concrete situations such as topological spaces, graphs and ultrafilters. In particular, we prove that Chu transforms between ultrafilters correspond to the Rudin-Keisler ordering.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Generic Vector Space Endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the model companion of an endomorphism acting on a vector space, possibly with extra structure. Given a theory $T$ that $\varnothing$-defines an infinite $K$-vector space $\mathbb{V}$ in every model, we set $T_\theta := T \cup \{\text{``$\theta$ defines a $K$-endomorphism of $\mathbb{V}$"}\}$. We then consider extensions of the form $$ T_\theta \cup \left\{\sum\nolimits_{k}\bigcap\nolimits_{l}\operatorname{Ker}(\rho_{j, k, l}[\theta]) = \sum\nolimits_{k}\bigcap\nolimits_{l} \operatorname{Ker}(\eta_{j, k, l}[\theta]) : j \in \mathcal{J}\right\}, $$ where all sums and intersections are finite, and all the $\rho[\theta]$'s and $\eta[\theta]$'s are polynomials over $K$ with $\theta$ plugged in. Notice that properties such as $\theta^2 - 2\operatorname{Id} = 0$ or $\operatorname{Ker}(\theta^n) = \operatorname{Ker}(\theta^{n+1})$ can be expressed in such a manner. We then parametrize the consistent extensions of this form by a family $\{T^C_\theta : C \in \mathcal{C}\}$ and characterize the existentially closed models of each $T^C_\theta$. We also present a sufficient criterion, which only depends on $T$, for when these characterizations are first-order expressible, i.e., for when a model companion of each $T^C_\theta$ exists.</description>

      <title>Looking for stabilizers in NSOP$\_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study some examples of groups definable and type-definable in NSOP1 theories. We exhibit some behaviors of these groups that differ from the ones of simple groups. We take interest in the notions of generics and stabilizers, and define the Kim-stabilizer. We apply the notion of Kim-stabilizer and the stabilizer from Hrushovsky to the context of a group G definable in an NSOP1 field F satisfying some assumptions to show that there is a finite to one embedding of a type definable subgroup of G of bounded index into an algebraic group over F. We then show that definable groups in omega-free PAC fields satisfy these conditions.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>
