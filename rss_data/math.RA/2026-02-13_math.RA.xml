      <title>Weakly Sigma-cotorsion rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of rings $R$ for which every direct sum of injective $R$-modules is cotorsion. We call them weakly $\Sigma$-cotorsion rings. The defining property might be seen as the dual of Chase's characterization of coherence in terms of the flatness of every direct product of projective $R$-modules. More generally, we study rings over which direct sums of injective modules have finite cotorsion dimension and call them weakly $n$-$\Sigma$-cotorsion rings, as well as rings over which direct sums of cotorsion modules have finite cotorsion dimension (called $n$-$\Sigma$-cotorsion rings). In the process, we obtain new characterizations of $n$-perfect rings and extend previous results by Guil Asensio and Herzog, and by \v{S}aroch and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <title>The Cylinder Simplicial DG Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a DG ring $B$ and an integer $q \geq 0$, we construct the $q$-th cylinder DG ring $Cyl_q(B)$. For $q = 1$ this is just Keller's cylinder DG ring, sometimes called the path object of $B$, which encodes homotopies between DG ring homomorphisms $A \to B$.
  As $q$ changes the cylinder DG rings form a simplicial DG ring $Cyl(B)$. Hence, given another DG ring $A$, the DG ring homomorphisms $A \to Cyl(B)$ form a simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. Our main theorem states that when $A$ is a semi-free DG ring, the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$ is a Kan complex.
  For the verification of the Kan condition we introduce a new construction, which may be of independent interest. Given a horn $Y$, we define the DG ring $N(Y,B)$, and we prove that $N(Y,B)$ represents this horn in the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. In this way the Kan condition is implemented intrinsically in the category of DG rings, thus facilitating calculations.
  Presumably all the above can be extended, with little change, from DG rings to (small) DG categories. That would enable easy constructions and explicit calculations of some simplicial aspects of DG categories.</description>

      <title>Radicals in primitive axial algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contributes to the structure theory of primitive axial algebras. For a primitive axial algebra $A$ with a Frobenius form we compare the largest ideal $R(A)$ not containing any of the generating axes, the radical $A^\perp$ of the form, and the Jacobson radical $J(A)$, which we define simply as the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$.</description>

      <title>UltraLIF: Fully Differentiable Spiking Neural Networks via Ultradiscretization and Max-Plus Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\eps \to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Parametric reflection maps: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study solutions of the parametric set-theoretic reflection equation from an algebraic perspective by employing recently derived generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks, called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. Generic invertible solutions of the set-theoretic reflection equation are also obtained by a suitable parametric twist. The twist leads to considerably simplified constraints compared to the ones obtained from general set-theoretic reflections. In this context, novel algebraic structures of (skew) p-braces that generalize the known (skew) braces and are suitable for the parametric Yang-Baxter equation are introduced. The p-rack Yang-Baxter and reflection operators as well as the associated algebraic structures are defined setting up the frame for formulating the p-rack reflection algebra.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Spectral Graph Theory: Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks via Biorthogonal Bases (Adjacency-Operator Formulation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory and graph signal processing rely on a symmetry principle: undirected graphs induce symmetric (self-adjoint) adjacency/Laplacian operators, yielding orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier expansions. Real-world networks are typically directed and hence asymmetric, producing non-self-adjoint and frequently non-normal operators for which orthogonality fails and spectral coordinates can be ill-conditioned. In this paper we develop an original harmonic-analysis framework for directed networks centered on the \emph{adjacency} operator. We propose a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional. We prove exact synthesis/analysis identities under diagonalizability, establish sampling-and-reconstruction guarantees for BGFT-bandlimited signals, and derive perturbation/stability bounds that explain why naive orthogonal-GFT assumptions break down on non-normal directed graphs. A simulation protocol compares undirected versus directed cycles (asymmetry without non-normality) and a perturbed directed cycle (genuine non-normality), demonstrating that BGFT yields coherent reconstruction and filtering across asymmetric regimes.</description>

      <title>Representing in Low Rank I: conjugacy, topological and homological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\operatorname{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\operatorname{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.
  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.
  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</description>
