      <title>Winners vs. Losers: Momentum-based Strategies with Intertemporal Choice for ESG Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a state-dependent momentum framework that integrates ESG regime switching with tail-risk-aware reward-risk metrics. Using a dynamic programming approach and solving a finite-horizon Bellman equation, we construct long-short momentum portfolios that adjust to changing ESG sentiment regimes. Unlike traditional momentum strategies based on historical returns, our approach incorporates the Stable Tail Adjusted Return ratio and Rachev ratio to better capture downside risk in turbulent markets. We apply this framework across three asset classes, Russell 3000 equities, Dow Jones~30 stocks, and cryptocurrencies, under both pro- and anti-ESG market regimes. We find that ESG-loser portfolios significantly outperform ESG-winner portfolios in pro-ESG regimes, a counterintuitive result suggesting that market overreaction to ESG sentiment creates short-term pricing inefficiencies. This pattern is robust across tail-sensitive performance metrics and is most pronounced under a two-week formation and holding period. Our framework highlights how ESG considerations and sentiment regimes alter return dynamics, offering practical guidance for investors seeking to implement responsive momentum strategies under sustainability constraints. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about ESG investing and underscore the importance of dynamic, regime-aware portfolio construction in environments shaped by regulatory signals, investor flows, and behavioral biases.</description>

      <title>Climate impacts and monetary costs of healthy diets worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 2.8 billion people worldwide cannot afford the least expensive foods required for a healthy diet. Since 2020, the Cost and Affordability of a Healthy Diet (CoAHD) has been published for all countries by FAO and the World Bank and is widely used to guide social protection, agricultural, and public health and nutrition policies. Here, we measure how healthy diets could be obtained with the lowest possible greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in ways that could further inform food choice and policy decisions toward sustainability goals. We find that the lowest possible GHG emissions for a healthy diet in 2021 would emit 0.67 kg CO2e (SD=0.10) and cost USD 6.95 (SD=1.86) per day, while each country's lowest-priced items would emit 1.65 kg CO2e (SD=0.56) and cost USD 3.68 (SD=0.75). Healthy diets with foods in proportions actually consumed in each country would emit 2.44 kg CO2e (SD=1.27) and cost USD 9.96 (SD=4.92). Differences in emissions are driven by item selection within animal-source foods, and starchy staples to a lesser extent, with only minor differences in other food groups. Results show how changes in agricultural policy and food choice can most cost-effectively support healthier and more sustainable diets worldwide.</description>

      <title>Frictions and Welfare in Monopolistic Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a heterogeneous firm economy with monopolistic competition, could informational asymmetries between entrepreneurs and financial intermediaries sometimes improve welfare? We study this question by developing a model where banks finance entrepreneurs under asymmetric information. While aggregate productivity decreases with informational frictions, we find that welfare can be maximized at intermediate levels of information asymmetry due to a trade-off between productivity and product variety. Additionally, moderate input cost distortions can improve welfare when financial frictions are severe by offsetting the resulting weak firm selection.</description>

      <title>Document Valuation in LLM Summaries: A Cluster Shapley Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley, an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Gender Wage Gap in the University of North Carolina System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender pay equity remains an open challenge in academia despite decades of movements. Prior studies, however, have relied largely on descriptive regressions, leaving causal analysis underexplored. This study examines gender-based wage disparities among tenure-track faculty in the University of North Carolina system using both parametric and non-parametric causal inference methods. In particular, we employed propensity score matching and causal forests to estimate the causal effect of gender on academic salary while controlling for university type, discipline, titles, working years, and scholarly productivity metrics. The results indicate that on average female professors earn approximately 6% less than their male colleagues with similar qualifications and positions.</description>

      <title>Transaction Proximity: A Graph-Based Approach to Blockchain Fraud Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fraud-deterrent access validation system for public blockchains, leveraging two complementary concepts: "Transaction Proximity", which measures the distance between wallets in the transaction graph, and "Easily Attainable Identities (EAIs)", wallets with direct transaction connections to centralized exchanges. Recognizing the limitations of traditional approaches like blocklisting (reactive, slow) and strict allow listing (privacy-invasive, adoption barriers), we propose a system that analyzes transaction patterns to identify wallets with close connections to centralized exchanges.
  Our directed graph analysis of the Ethereum blockchain reveals that 56% of large USDC wallets (with a lifetime maximum balance greater than \$10,000) are EAI and 88% are within one transaction hop of an EAI. For transactions exceeding \$2,000, 91% involve at least one EAI. Crucially, an analysis of past exploits shows that 83% of the known exploiter addresses are not EAIs, with 21% being more than five hops away from any regulated exchange. We present three implementation approaches with varying gas cost and privacy tradeoffs, demonstrating that EAI-based access control can potentially prevent most of these incidents while preserving blockchain openness. Importantly, our approach does not restrict access or share personally identifiable information, but it provides information for protocols to implement their own validation or risk scoring systems based on specific needs. This middle-ground solution enables programmatic compliance while maintaining the core values of open blockchain.</description>

      <title>A Branch-Price-Cut-And-Switch Approach for Optimizing Team Formation and Routing for Airport Baggage Handling Tasks with Stochastic Travel Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage handling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient processes. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and propose a novel solution approach that we call Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Shock Compensation in the Multi-layer Network of Global Food Production and Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global food production and trade networks are highly dynamic, especially in response to shortages when countries adjust their supply strategies. In this study, we examine adjustments across 123 agri-food products from 192 countries resulting in 23616 individual scenarios of food shortage, and calibrate a multi-layer network model to understand the propagation of the shocks. We analyze shock mitigation actions, such as increasing imports, boosting production, or substituting food items. Our findings indicate that these lead to spillover effects potentially exacerbating food inequality: an Indian rice shock resulted in a 5.8 % increase in rice losses in countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI) and a 14.2 % decrease in those with a high HDI. Considering multiple interacting shocks leads to super-additive losses of up to 12 % of the total available food volume across the global food production network. This framework allows us to identify combinations of shocks that pose substantial systemic risks and reduce the resilience of the global food supply.</description>

      <title>Distributional Consequences of Political Freedom: Inequality in Transition Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the origins of income inequality in post-socialist countries from Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, from 1991 to 2016. The aim is to analyze the relationship between democracy and income inequality. In previous studies, this topic has led to ambiguous findings, especially in the context of the group of countries we are focusing on. We examine whether the process of democratization cooccurred with changes in income distribution over the entire period under study, and its impact on individual income deciles to determine who benefited most from the new system. The obtained results allowed us to confirm that the actual relationship between democratization and income inequality did not exist, or at most was illusory in the 1990s, but it was present, relevant, and had a proequality character between 2001 and 2016. During that period, the development of the democratic system benefited at least 80\% of the lower part of the income distribution, at the expense especially of the top deciles share of total income. Those results confirmed that democratization positively affected the shares of lower income deciles in postsocialist countries.</description>

      <title>Modelling bounded rational decision-making through Wasserstein constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for AI-Human Integration in Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit, introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success, identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker. This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing them.</description>
