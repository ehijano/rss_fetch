      <title>An Integrated Model for Financial Risk Assessment of Grid-ignited Wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the frequency and intensity of grid-ignited wildfires have increased significantly, leading to an elevated level of risk exposure to public safety and financial repercussions for electric utilities threatening their solvency. It is, therefore, imperative for electric utilities to accurately assess the financial impact of potential wildfires ignited by their power infrastructure. This is a critical step toward developing risk-informed strategies to mitigate grid-ignited wildfires from both operational and financial perspectives. This paper proposes and develops an integrated model to evaluate the damage costs associated with potential grid-ignited wildfires to allow assessing financial risk with greater precision than existing literature. The proposed model is tailored to assess the financial risk associated with grid-ignited wildfires, including environmental damages, destroyed structures, and damage to the power grid assets. We quantify the risk associated with each power line, thereby identifying areas that require immediate preemptive actions. To visually represent the risk levels associated with the transmission grid topology, we implement a color-coded risk heatmap. The heatmap categorizes risk levels as follows: low-risk areas are denoted in white, moderate-low risk regions in green, medium-risk areas in yellow, and high-risk zones in red...</description>

      <title>Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto.gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Q-network (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto.gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto.gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric-protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto.gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</description>
