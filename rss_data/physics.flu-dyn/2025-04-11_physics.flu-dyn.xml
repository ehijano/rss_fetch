      <title>Simultaneous layout and device parameter optimisation of a wave energy park in an irregular sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of optimal wave energy parks, namely, arrays of devices known as wave energy converters (WECs) that extract energy from water waves, is an important consideration for the renewable transition. In this paper, the problem of simultaneously optimising the layout and device parameters of a wave energy park is considered within the framework of linear water wave theory. Each WEC is modelled as a heaving truncated cylinder coupled to a spring-damper power take-off. The single-WEC scattering problem is solved using an integral equation/Galerkin method, and interactions between the WECs are solved via a self-consistent multiple scattering theory. The layout of the array and power take-off parameters of its constituent devices are simultaneously optimised using a genetic algorithm, with the goal of maximising energy absorption under a unidirectional, irregular sea described by a Pierson--Moskowitz spectrum. When constrained to a rectangular bounding box that is elongated in the direction of wave propagation, the optimal arrays consist of graded pseudo-line arrays when the number of WECs is sufficiently large. Moreover, low-frequency waves propagate further into the array than high-frequency waves, which is indicative of rainbow absorption, namely, the effect wherein waves spatially separate in a graded array based on their frequency, and are preferentially absorbed at these locations. Arrays optimised for a square bounding box did not show strong evidence of grading or rainbow reflection, which indicates that more complicated interaction effects are present.</description>

      <title>Modelli idrodinamici per la verifica della dinamica di navi in avanzamento</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of predicting the loads and motions induced by wave systems on a ship in forward motion (seakeeping). Assuming that the hull is rigid, the motion of the ship is described by the equations of rigid body mechanics. The hydrodynamic phenomenon is analyzed using the inviscid fluid scheme in irrotational motion, leading to an initial value problem for Laplaces equation, coupled with the ship's motion, characterized by strong non-linearity due to the presence of moving boundaries (the hull surface and the air-water interface). Therefore, the mathematical problem has been further simplified by assuming small amplitude ship motion, resulting in a linear model for the fluid-dynamic problem. In this context, two approaches are developed: one in the frequency domain and the other in the time domain. Computational codes have been implemented for both formulations, and a wide range of results has been obtained for ship hulls of increasing geometric complexity. In the case of the frequency-domain model, several hull shapes were systematically studied, and the comparison with experimental data showed satisfactory agreement. The developed code was applied to the reference problem of the departure of a hull in the absence of waves, and the satisfactory comparison with experimental and numerical results from stationary codes indicates the good potential of the method.</description>

      <title>Bistability and charge-density blowup in the onset of drop Quincke rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles in a sufficiently strong electric field spontaneously rotate, provided that charge relaxation is slower in the particle than in the suspending fluid. It has long been known that drops also exhibit such "Quincke rotation," with the electrohydrodynamic flow induced by electrical shear stresses at the interface leading to an increased critical field. However, the hysteretic onset of this instability, observed for sufficiently low-viscosity drops, has so far eluded theoretical understanding -- including simulations that have struggled in this regime owing to charge-density-steepening effects driven by surface convection. Here, we conduct a numerical study of the leaky-dielectric model in a simplified two-dimensional setting involving a circular drop, considering arbitrary viscosity ratios and field strengths. As the viscosity of the drop is decreased relative to the suspending fluid, the pitchfork bifurcation marking the onset of drop rotation is found to transition from supercritical to subcritical, giving rise to a field-strength interval of bistability. In this subcritical regime, the critical field is always large enough that, at the bifurcation, the symmetric base-state solution exhibits equatorial charge-density blowup singularities of the type recently described by Peng et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 9 083701, 2024). As the rotation speed increases along the initially unstable solution branch from the bifurcation, the singularities gradually shift from the equator and ultimately disperse once the rotational component of the flow is strong enough to eliminate the surface stagnation points.</description>

      <title>Differential Equation Based Wall Distance Approaches for Maritime Engineering Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with modeling and simulating approaches of wall distance functions based on Partial Differential Equations (PDE). The distance to the nearest wall is required for many industrial problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The first part of the manuscript addresses fundamental aspects of wall distance modeling and simulation. The following approaches are considered: Nonlinear and linear p-Poisson and Screened-Poisson methods, Eikonal and regularized Eikonal or Hamilton-Jacobi methods, and alternatives using Laplace equations. Following the definition of boundary and initial conditions, the discrete approximation and relevant measures to increase its numerical robustness are described. In the second part, the different methods are applied to hydrodynamic and aerodynamic flow applications from maritime engineering, each relying on Shear Stress Transport (SST) strategies for turbulence modeling that require the distance to the nearest wall at different procedural points. The hydrodynamic behavior of a model scale bulk carrier cruising at ReL=7.246E+6 and Fn = 0.142 is investigated on the influence of the wall distance formulation for predicting resistance and propulsion behavior in conjunction with statistical turbulence modeling method. It is shown that the different wall distance modeling barely influences relevant integral hydrodynamic quantities such as drag, trim, and sinkage, and related errors are in the range of O(0.1%) and, therefore, significantly below typical modeling, discretization, and approximation errors. Subsequently, the wall distance methods were investigated for the aerodynamic analysis of a full-scale feeder ship at ReL = 5E+08. A hybrid averaged/filtered approach, in line with the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model, is utilized, and the results indicate an improved sensitivity to the choice of the wall distance model.</description>

      <title>Euler-Lagrange study of Microbubble-Laden Turbulent Flow over Superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For slow-speed ships, underwater vehicles, and pipe transportation systems, viscous resistance accounts for a large proportion of the total energy losses. As such, various technologies have been developed to reduce viscous resistance and enhance energy efficiency in these applications. Air injection and surface treatment are two representative drag reduction techniques. Additionally, efforts to combine multiple drag-reduction techniques have been the subject of extensive research. In this study, the synergistic effects of integrating microbubble injection and superhydrophobic Surface(SHS) drag reduction approaches were analyzed. A 2-way coupling Euler-Lagrange approach was used alongside direct numerical simulation, based on the spectral element method, to investigate the synergistic effects of applying two separate drag reduction methods. Three types of SHS were investigated in our simulations; post type, transverse ridge type, and ridge type. The drag reduction performances and flow characteristics of the various configurations, with and without microbubble injection, were compared in a turbulent horizontal channel flow with $Re_{\tau}=180$. The results of these tests showed that, combining post-type SHS with microbubbles was the most effective, producing a synergistic drag reduction effect. However, combining microbubble injection with ridge-type SHS increased drag relative to ridge-type SHS alone, showing the importance of carefully selecting wall type for the best possible performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Emulating Computationally Expensive Postfire Debris Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional physics-based models of geophysical flows, such as debris flows and landslides that pose significant risks to human lives and infrastructure are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for large-scale parameter sweeps, uncertainty quantification, inversions or real-time applications. This study presents an efficient alternative, a deep learning-based surrogate model built using a modified U-Net architecture to predict the dynamics of runoff-generated debris flows across diverse terrain based on data from physics based simulations. The study area is divided into smaller patches for localized predictions using a patch-predict-stitch methodology (complemented by limited global data to accelerate training). The patches are then combined to reconstruct spatially continuous flow maps, ensuring scalability for large domains. To enable fast training using limited expensive simulations, the deep learning model was trained on data from an ensemble of physics based simulations using parameters generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and validated on unseen parameter sets and terrain, achieving maximum pointwise errors below 10% and robust generalization. Uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo methods are enabled using the validated surrogate, which can facilitate probabilistic hazard assessments. This study highlights the potential of deep learning surrogates as powerful tools for geophysical flow analysis, enabling computationally efficient and reliable probabilistic hazard map predictions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Equivariance: Modeling Turbulence with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel methodology for turbulence modeling in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which embeds the discrete rotational, reflectional and translational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations into the model architecture. In addition, suitable invariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be embedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving simulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for two canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent channel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual simulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are consistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is demonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers rotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual simulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with non-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these properties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel flow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and is able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown that the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in the near-wall and outer regions. The proposed approach thus demonstrates the potential of GNNs for turbulence modeling, especially in the context of LES and RL.</description>

      <title>Parasitic Gas Evolution Reactions in Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries: A Lattice Boltzmann Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are a promising technology to capture and store energy from renewable sources, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation. However, during the charging process, the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode affects the performance and durability of VFRBs. The evolution of hydrogen bubbles causes the loss of effective reaction area and blocks the transport of reactants. We employ the lattice Boltzmann method to investigate the two-phase flow transport in the negative electrode of VRFBs. Systematic parametric analyses reveal that increased gas production leads to uneven gas removal from the electrode, while an optimal flow rate can effectively remove bubbles and reduce external pumping energy. Additionally, increasing the compression ratio hinders gas removal but enhances electrode electrical conductivity. Overall, the present study provides valuable mechanistic insights into bubble generation at the negative electrode of VRFBs and offers a theoretical reference for designing and optimizing VRFBs.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Predictability in Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are strongly chaotic and unpredictable, with a Lyapunov exponent that increases with the Reynolds number. Here, we study the chaoticity of the Surface Quasi-geostrophic system, a two-dimensional model for geophysical flows that displays a direct cascade similar to that of three-dimensional turbulence. Using high-resolution direct numerical simulations, we investigate the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the Reynolds number and find an anomalous scaling exponent larger than the one predicted by dimensional arguments. We also study the finite-time fluctuation of the Lyapunov exponent by computing the Cram\'er function associated with its probability distribution. We find that the Cram\'er function attains a self-similar form at large Re.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic effects in an inductively coupled plasma wind tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a three-dimensional model for the 350kW Plasmatron X inductively coupled plasma facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, designed for testing high-temperature materials. Simulations of the facility have been performed using a three-dimensional, multiphysics computational framework, which reveals pronounced three-dimensional characteristics within the facility. The analysis of the plasma and electromagnetic field in the torch region reveals the influence of the helical coils, which cause a non-axisymmetric distribution of the plasma discharge. Additionally, simulations of the torch-chamber configuration at two operating pressures have been conducted to examine the impact of plasma asymmetry in the torch on jet characteristics in the chamber. The results indicate an unsteady, three-dimensional behavior of the plasma jet at high pressure. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) has been performed on the unsteady flow field to identify the dominant modes and their associated frequencies. At low pressure, a steady, supersonic, nearly axisymmetric plasma jet forms with consistent flow properties, such as temperature and velocity. However, strong non-equilibrium effects at low pressures lead to substantial deviations in species concentrations from axial symmetry despite having an almost axisymmetric distribution for quantities such as velocity and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Computing with a Single Oscillating Gas Bubble: Emphasizing the Chaotic Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of artificial intelligence systems urge the exploration of alternative software and hardware solutions that exploit physical effects for computation. According to machine learning theory, a neural network-based computational system must exhibit nonlinearity to effectively model complex patterns and relationships. This requirement has driven extensive research into various nonlinear physical systems to enhance the performance of neural networks. In this paper, we propose and theoretically validate a reservoir computing system based on a single bubble trapped within a bulk of liquid. By applying an external acoustic pressure wave to both encode input information and excite the complex nonlinear dynamics, we showcase the ability of this single-bubble reservoir computing system to forecast complex benchmarking time series and undertake classification tasks with high accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chaotic physical regime of bubble oscillation proves to be the most effective for this kind of computations.</description>

      <title>Implicit Incompressible Porous Flow using SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implicit porous flow solver using SPH, which maintains fluid incompressibility and is able to model a wide range of scenarios, driven by strongly coupled solid-fluid interaction forces. Many previous SPH porous flow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid interface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid and solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows us to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account and results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can simulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid and solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit forces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These we solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid elasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely drag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic behavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening, we propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of porous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure forces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to naturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with static sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is difficult because of the multiscale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lack accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank ``many wrong models'' and to blend their predictions. We evaluated our \emph{weighted Bayesian update} algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the turbulent transport of odors in presence of a strong mean wind. Despite minimal prior information on the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectrum correction in Ekman-Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a linear friction drag affects significantly the dynamics of turbulent flows in two-dimensions. At small scales, it induces a correction to the slope of the energy spectrum in the range of wavenumbers corresponding to the direct enstrophy cascade. Simple arguments predict that this correction is proportional to the ratio of the friction coefficient to the characteristic deformation rate of the flow. In this work, we examine this phenomenon by means of a set of GPU-accelerated numerical simulations at high resolutions, varying both the Reynolds number and the friction coefficient. Exploiting the relation between the energy spectrum and the enstrophy flux, we obtain accurate measurements of the spectral scaling exponents. Our results show that the exponent of the spectral correction follows a universal linear law in which the friction coefficient is rescaled by the enstrophy injection rate.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stratification on Surface-Intensified Eastward Jets in Turbulent Gyres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the role of stratification in the formation and persistence of eastward jets (like the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio currents). Using a wind-driven, two-layer quasi-geostrophic model in a double-gyre configuration, we construct a phase diagram to classify flow regimes. The parameter space is defined by a criticality parameter \( \xi \), which controls the emergence of baroclinic instability, and the ratio of layer depths \( \delta \), which describes the surface intensification of stratification. Eastward jets detaching from the western boundary are observed when \( \delta \ll 1 \) and \( \xi \sim 1 \), representing a regime transition from a vortex-dominated western boundary current to a zonostrophic regime characterized by multiple eastward jets. Remarkably, these surface-intensified patterns emerge without considering bottom friction. The emergence of the coherent eastward jet is further addressed with complementary 1.5-layer simulations and explained through both linear stability analysis and turbulence phenomenology. In particular, we show that coherent eastward jets emerge when the western boundary layer is stable, and find that the asymmetry in the baroclinic instability of eastward and westward flows plays a central role in the persistence of eastward jets, while contributing to the disintegration of westward jets.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. The good agreement between the numerical solutions and the LSA allows us to propose a method for measuring surface energy patterns from early time-step film height profiles with good precision. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations. This offers insights into the dependency of the resultant droplet arrays on shape, feature size, and magnitude of the chemical patterning of the underlying substrate.</description>

      <title>Superballistic conduction in hydrodynamic antidot graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a non-collective to a collective regime of transport, behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.</description>
