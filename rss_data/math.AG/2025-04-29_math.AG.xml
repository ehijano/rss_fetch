      <title>Link constancy in deformations of inner Khovanskii non-degenerate maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a (mixed) polynomial map $ f: \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{K}^p $, with $ f(0) = 0 $ and $ \mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R} $ or $ \mathbb{C} $, we introduce the notion of inner Khovanskii non-degeneracy (IKND) a sufficient condition that ensures the link of the singularity of $ f $ at the origin is well defined. We then study one-parameter deformations of an IKND map $ f $, given by $ F(\boldsymbol{x}, \varepsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{x}) + \theta(\boldsymbol{x}, \varepsilon) $. We prove that the deformation is link-constant under suitable conditions on $ f $ and $ \theta $, meaning that the isotopy type of the link remains unchanged along the deformation. Furthermore, by employing a strong version of IKND (SIKND), we obtain results on topological triviality.</description>

      <title>Nowhere vanishing 1-forms on 4-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove -- in dimension at most 4 -- a conjectue of Hao which says that a morphism $f : X \to A$ to a simple abelian variety $A$ is smooth if and only if there is a 1-form pulled back from A without any zeros. We also give a complete classification of 4-folds with a 1-form without zeros not admitting a map to an elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>A Construction of Formal Frobenius Manifold from Deformation of Complex Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies Frobenius manifolds arising from extended deformations of complex structures on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, following the construction by Sergey Barannikov and Maxim Kontsevich. The work is based on the investigation of formal moduli spaces of solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equations modulo gauge equivalence. We provide a foundational overview of deformation theory from the perspective of differential geometry and prove the equivalence between gauge-equivalent deformations and isomorphic deformations. Based on this framework, we construct a differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkovisky (dGBV) algebra associated to the deformation of Calabi-Yau manifolds and then construct the corresponding Frobenius manifold.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangianity of $p$-supports of holonomic D-modules and $q$-D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem.</description>

      <title>On The Smoothness of Cayley Conditions in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poncelet's porism concerns the existence of polygons simultaneously inscribed in one conic and circumscribed about another. Cayley's theorem provides algebraic conditions for such polygons to exist, expressed through the coefficients of a certain determinantal expansion. In this paper, we focus on the case of triangles and establish three main results concerning the geometry of the Cayley condition. First, we derive an explicit algebraic equation that defines the Cayley set - the locus of conic pairs admitting Poncelet triangles - and prove that this set is a constructible set in the space of conic pairs. Second, we demonstrate that the Cayley set is a smooth manifold by showing it is an open subset of the total space of a smooth trivial fiber bundle with fibers isomorphic to a quadric hypersurface. Finally, we formulate the Poncelet correspondence as a principal bundle whose fibers are complex tori (elliptic curves), proving that all elliptic curves arising from conic pairs in the Cayley set are isomorphic. This differential-geometric approach not only clarifies the structure of the solution space for Poncelet triangles.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of $\mathscr{D}$-modules along semi-invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth algebraic variety X with an action of a connected reductive linear algebraic group G, and an equivariant D-module M, we study the G-decompositions of the associated V-, Hodge, and weight filtrations.
  If M is the localization of a D-module S underlying a mixed twistor D-module (e.g. when S is simple) along a semi-invariant function, we determine the weight level of any element in an irreducible isotypic component of M in terms of multiplicities of roots of b-functions. In the case where S=O_X, we show that the Hodge level is governed by the degrees of another class of polynomials, also expressible in terms of b-functions.
  As an application, if X is an affine spherical variety, we describe these filtrations representation-theoretically in terms of roots of b-functions, and compute all higher multiplier and Hodge ideals associated with semi-invariant functions. Examples include the spaces of general, skew-symmetric, and symmetric matrices, as well as the Freudenthal cubic on the fundamental representation of E_6.</description>

      <title>Cosection localization via shifted symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to shed a new light on classical constructions in enumerative geometry from the view point of derived algebraic geometry. We first prove that the cosection localized virtual cycle of a quasi-smooth derived Deligne-Mumford stack with a $(-1)$-shifted closed $1$-form is equal to the virtual Lagrangian cycle of the degeneracy locus which is $(-2)$-shifted symplectic. We next establish a shifted analogue of the Lagrange multipliers method which gives us the quantum Lefschetz theorems as immediate consequences of the equality of virtual cycles. Lastly we study derived algebraic geometry enhancements of gauged linear sigma models which lead us to the relative virtual cycles in a general and natural form.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of higher cohomology and cohomological rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work begins by studying the vanishing of higher cohomology for the derived pushforward of a torsion free sheaf along a modification of integral Noetherian schemes. Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe for constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some of which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we explore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of rational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's derived splinters and Kov\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.</description>

      <title>Wahl singularities in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any fixed $1 \leq \ell \leq 9$, we characterize all Wahl singularities that appear in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\ell$. This extends the work of Manetti and Hacking-Prokhorov in degree $9$, where Wahl singularities are classified using the Markov equation. To achieve this, we introduce del Pezzo Wahl chains with markings. They define marked del Pezzo surfaces $W_{*m}$ that govern all such degenerations. We also prove that every marked del Pezzo surface degenerates into a canonically defined toric del Pezzo surface with only T-singularities. In addition, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the $W_{*m}$ surfaces and certain fake weighted projective planes. As applications, we show that every Wahl singularity occurs for del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\leq 4$, but that there are infinitely many Wahl singularities that do not arise for degrees $\geq 5$. We also use Hacking's exceptional collections to provide geometric proofs of recent results by Polishchuk and Rains on exceptional vector bundles on del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Flat degenerations of flag supermanifolds for basic Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by bases of representations compatible with the PBW filtration for basic Lie superalgebras by Kus and Fourier, we generalise the construction of degenerations of flag varieties via favourable modules to the super setup. In the classical setup, this method of degenerating flag varieties by Feigin, Fourier and, Littelmann relies on constructing bases of representations of Lie algebras such that in the coordinate ring of an embedded flag varietiy their multiplication can be identified with an affine semigroup modulo terms of higher degree. By killing off said terms of higher degree via a filtration construction, one gets a toric variety the embedded flag variety degenerates into. By adapting these techniques we provide a similar construction and discuss when one can get a degeneration into a toric supervariety, as defined by Jankowski</description>

      <title>Invertible Morava motives in quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate to any element in the Milnor K-theory of a field $k$ modulo 2 an invertible Morava K-theory motive over $k$. Specifically, for $\alpha$ in $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ we construct an invertible $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive $L_\alpha$ in a way that is natural in the base field and additive in $\alpha$. This can be seen as categorification of $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ in motives.
  The motives $L_\alpha$ are constructed as direct summands of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives of quadrics, and we develop the necessary framework for the study of the latter. We show that passing to the field of functions of quadrics of dimension greater than or equal to $2^{n+1}-1$ does not lose any information about the structure of $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives. This is based on the study of "decomposition of the diagonal" in Morava K-theory of quadrics.
  For quadrics of dimension less than $2^{n+1}-1$, we show that their Chow motives can be "reconstructed" from their $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives, although the latter appear structurally simpler. Our proof of this result relies on the use of the unstable symmetric operations of Vishik on algebraic cobordism.
  The occurrence of the motive $L_\alpha$ as a direct summand of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive of $X$ can be seen as evidence that $\alpha$ is a cohomological invariant of $X$. We study this occurrence for quadrics and relate it to Kahn's Descent conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $F$-signature is a fundamental numerical invariant of singularities in positive characteristic. Its positivity detects strong $F$-regularity, an important class of singularities related to KLT singularities in characteristic zero. In this paper, we compute the limiting $F$-signature function of binomial and other related hypersurfaces in two variables as the characteristic $p \to \infty$. In particular, we show it is a piecewise polynomial function, and relate it to the normalized volume.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry for brane diagrams and bow varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide combinatorial and numerical criteria to characterize affine type A bow diagrams giving rise to a non-empty bow variety. The key idea is to prove that such diagrams correspond to supersymmetric brane systems in type IIB string theory, allowing us to reformulate the problem in purely combinatorial terms. To achieve this, we characterize supersymmetry for affine type A brane systems (and, by extension, for types B, C, and D) using Hanany--Witten transitions. This leads to a finite-step algorithm that decides whether a given affine type A bow or brane diagram is supersymmetric, which consists in checking a finite set of inequalities, so providing a numerical criterion for non-emptiness. Finally, we provide a different perspective by introducing a further criterion in terms of weights of affine Lie algebras. Along the way, we also prove that increasing dimension vectors between two consecutive x-points or arrows in a bow diagram (not necessarily of type A) preserves the properties of generating non-empty bow varieties.</description>

Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formulas of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <title>Deciding summability via residues in theory and in practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In difference algebra, summability arises as a basic problem upon which rests the effective solution of other more elaborate problems, such as creative telescoping problems and the computation of Galois groups of difference equations. In 2012 Chen and Singer introduced discrete residues as a theoretical obstruction to summability for rational functions with respect to the shift and $q$-dilation difference operators. Since then analogous notions of discrete residues have been defined in other difference settings relevant for applications, such as for Mahler and elliptic shift difference operators. Very recently there have been some advances in making these theoretical obstructions computable in practice.</description>

Abstract: Let $A\to C$ be a proper surjective morphism from a smooth connected quasi-projective commutative group scheme of dimension 2 to a smooth curve. The construction of generalized Kummer varieties gives a proper morphism $A^{[[n]]}\to C^{((n))}$. We show that the perverse filtration associated with this morphism is multiplicative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Walcher's disk potential for the quintic threefold can be represented as a central charge of a specific Gauged Linear Sigma Model which we call the extended quintic GLSM. This representation provides an open/closed correspondence for the quintic threefold since the central charge is a generating function of closed genus-zero GLSM invariants. We also explain how open Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and open mirror symmetry for the quintic are compatible with wall-crossing and mirror symmetry of the extended GLSM, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many cases involving mirror symmetry, it is important to have concrete mirror dual families. In this paper, we construct crepant resolutions of the Batyrev-Borisov mirror dual family to the complete intersection of two cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^5$. It is, similarly to the mirrors of quintic threefolds, a family over $\mathbb{P}^1$ with singular fibers over the set $\{0, \infty\} \cup \mu_6$. We have the Picard-Fuchs equation and limiting mixed Hodge structures of the singular fibers. We find that the singular fiber over $\infty$ has maximal unipotent monodromy, and $0$ is of a new type compared to the quintic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the behavior of the volume function at the boundary of the pseudoeffective cone of certain Calabi-Yau complete intersections known as Wehler N-folds. We find that the volume function exhibits a pathological behavior when N&gt;=3, we obtain examples of a pseudoeffective R-divisor D for which the volume of D+sA, with s small and A ample, oscillates between two powers of s, and we deduce the sharp regularity of this function answering a question of Lazarsfeld. We also show that h^0(X,[mD]+A) displays a similar oscillatory behavior as m increases, showing that several notions of numerical dimensions of D do not agree and disproving a conjecture of Fujino. We accomplish this by relating the behavior of the volume function along a segment to the visits of a corresponding hyperbolic geodesics to the cusps of a hyperbolic manifold.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that $\mathcal{E}$ is a vector bundle on a smooth projective variety $X$. Given a family of curves $C$ on $X$, we study how the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of $\mathcal{E}|_{C}$ changes as we vary $C$ in our family. Heuristically we expect that the locus where the slopes in the Harder-Narasimhan filtration jump by $\mu$ should have codimension which depends linearly on $\mu$. We identify the geometric properties which determine whether or not this expected behavior holds. We then apply our results to study rank $2$ bundles on $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ and to study singular loci of moduli spaces of curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

Abstract: For any complex reductive group $G$ and any compact Riemann surface with genus $g&gt;0$, we show that every connected component of the associated character variety is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial and has symplectic singularities, and classify the connected components that admit symplectic resolutions. When $g&gt;1$, we use elliptic endoscopic groups to control the singularities caused by irreducible local systems with automorphism groups larger than the centre of $G$; when $g=1$, our analysis is based on some results of Borel-Friedman-Morgan. The main results for $g&gt;1$ were obtained by Herbig-Schwarz-Seaton via a different approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equilevel algebra is a subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ distinguished in this space by finitely many conditions of the type $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i)$, $x_i \neq \tilde x_i \in M$, or approximated by such subalgebras. For $M = S^1$ or ${\mathbb R}^1$, the regular points of the variety of equilevel algebras of codimension $k$ are known in knot theory as $k$-chord diagrams. The whole of this variety completes the space of chord diagrams in the same way as the Hilbert schemes complete the configuration spaces. We describe cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension three in the space $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and compute their homology groups and characteristic classes of canonical vector bundles on them.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To a topological groupoid endowed with an involution, we associate a topological groupoid of fixed points, generalizing the fixed-point subspace of a topological space with involution. We prove that when the topological groupoid with involution arises from a Deligne-Mumford stack over $\mathbb{R}$, this fixed locus coincides with the real locus of the stack. This provides a topological framework to study real algebraic stacks, and in particular real moduli spaces. Finally, we propose a Smith-Thom type conjecture in this setting, generalizing the Smith-Thom inequality for topological spaces endowed with an involution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second-order cone (SOC) is a class of simple convex cones and optimizing over them can be done more efficiently than with semidefinite programming. It is interesting both in theory and in practice to investigate which convex cones admit a representation using SOCs, given that they have a strong expressive ability. In this paper, we prove constructively that the cone of sums of nonnegative circuits (SONC) admits a SOC representation. Based on this, we give a new algorithm for unconstrained polynomial optimization via SOC programming. We also provide a hybrid numeric-symbolic scheme which combines the numerical procedure with a rounding-projection algorithm to obtain exact nonnegativity certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm for polynomials with fairly large degree and number of variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euclidean conformal integrals for an arbitrary number of points in any dimension are evaluated. Conformal transformations in the Euclidean space can be formulated as the Moebius group in terms of Clifford algebras. This is used to interpret conformal integrals as functions on the configuration space of points on the Euclidean space, solving linear differential equations, which, in turn, is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for the conformal integrals are obtained using toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. The solutions are made symmetric under the action of permutation of the points, as expected of quantities on the configuration space of unordered points, using the monodromy-invariant unique Hermitian form. Consistency of the solutions among different number of points is shown.</description>

Abstract: The Floer cohomology and the Fukaya category are not defined in general. Indeed, while the issue of obstructions can be theoretically addressed by introducing bounding cochains, the actual existence of even one such bounding cochain is usually unknown. This paper aims to deal with the problem. We study certain non-archimedean analytic structure that enriches the Maurer-Cartan theory of bounding cochains. Using this rigid structure and family Floer techniques, we prove that within a connected family of graded Lagrangian submanifolds, if any one Lagrangian is unobstructed (in a slightly stronger sense), then all remaining Lagrangians are automatically unobstructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We precisely uniform 3 theories that are widely used for symplectic geometers: (Almost) modules over Novikov ring, Persistence module, and Tamarkin category. Along with our method, we also give a neat understanding and language for the related results, in particular, Vaintrob's Novikov/log-perfectoid mirror symmetry for Novikov toric varieties. The results of this paper can also be treated as a study of persistent homology from a higher algebra point of view. Some of our results are shown in the literature, but our method is higher-categorical and sophisticated.
  As applications, we discuss a Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties and propose a conjecture for Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

Abstract: Let $(G, X)$ be a Shimura datum. In previous work with Christian Klevdal, we showed that the canonical $G(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$-valued local systems on Shimura varieties for $G$ form compatible systems after projection to the adjoint group of $G$. In this note, we strengthen this result to prove compatibility for the $G(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$-local systems themselves. We also include the crystalline compatibility, extending the adjoint case established in our joint work Jake Huryn, Kiran Kedlaya, and Christian Klevdal.</description>
