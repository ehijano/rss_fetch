      <title>Two-dimensional Entanglement-assisted Quantum Quasi-cyclic Low-density Parity-check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integer $g \ge 2$, we derive general conditions for the existence of a $2g$-cycle in the Tanner graph of two-dimensional ($2$-D) classical quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Based on these conditions, we construct a family of $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes with girth greater than $4$ by stacking $p \times p \times p$ tensors, where $p$ is an odd prime. Furthermore, for composite values of $p$, we propose two additional families of $2$-D classical LDPC codes obtained via similar tensor stacking. In this case, one family achieves girth greater than $4$, while the other attains girth greater than $6$. All the proposed $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes exhibit an erasure correction capability of at least $p \times p$. Based on the constructed classical $2$-D QC-LDPC codes, we derive two families of $2$-D entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. The first family of $2$-D EA-QLDPC codes is obtained from a pair of binary $2$-D classical LDPC codes and is designed such that the unassisted part of the Tanner graph of the resulting EA-QLDPC code is free of cycles of length four, while requiring only a single ebit to be shared across the quantum transceiver. The second family is constructed from a single $2$-D classical LDPC code whose Tanner graph is free from $4$-cycles. Moreover, the constructed EA-QLDPC codes inherit an erasure correction capability of $p \times p$, as the underlying classical codes possess the same erasure correction property.</description>

      <title>A Local Characterization of $f$-Divergences Yielding PSD Mutual-Information Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when the variable-indexed matrix of pairwise \(f\)-mutual informations \(M^{(f)}_{ij}=I_f(X_i;X_j)\) is positive semidefinite (PSD). Let \(f:(0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}\) be convex with \(f(1)=0\), finite in a neighborhood of \(1\), and with \(f(0)&lt;\infty\) so that diagonal terms are finite. We give a sharp \emph{local} characterization around independence: there exists \(\delta=\delta(f)&gt;0\) such that for every \(n\) and every finite-alphabet family \((X_1,\ldots,X_n)\) whose pairwise joint-to-product ratios lie in \((1-\delta,1+\delta)\), the matrix \(M^{(f)}\) is PSD if and only if \(f\) is analytic at \(1\) with a convergent expansion \(f(t)=\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} a_m (t-1)^m\) and \(a_m\ge 0\) on a neighborhood of \(1\). Consequently, any negative Taylor coefficient yields an explicit finite-alphabet counterexample under arbitrarily weak dependence, and non-analytic convex divergences (e.g.\ total variation) are excluded. This PSD requirement is distinct from Hilbertian/metric properties of divergences between distributions (e.g.\ \(\sqrt{\mathrm{JS}}\)): we study PSD of the \emph{variable-indexed} mutual-information matrix. The proof combines a replica embedding that turns monomial terms into Gram matrices with a replica-forcing reduction to positive-definite dot-product kernels, enabling an application of the Schoenberg--Berg--Christensen--Ressel classification.</description>

      <title>On the Information Leakage Envelope of the Gaussian Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pointwise maximal leakage (PML) envelope of the Gaussian mechanism, which characterizes the smallest information leakage bound that holds with high probability under arbitrary post-processing. For the Gaussian mechanism with a Gaussian secret, we derive a closed-form expression for the deterministic PML envelope for sufficiently small failure probabilities. We then extend this result to general unbounded secrets by identifying a sufficient condition under which the envelope coincides with the Gaussian case. In particular, we show that strongly log-concave priors satisfy this condition via an application of the Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Perspective on LLM Tokenizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) tokenizers act as structured compressors: by mapping text to discrete token sequences, they determine token count (and thus compute and context usage) and the statistical structure seen by downstream models. Despite their central role in LLM pipelines, the link between tokenization, compression efficiency and induced structure is not well understood. We empirically demonstrate that tokenizer training scale redistributes entropy: as training data grows, the token stream becomes more diverse in aggregate (higher unigram entropy) yet markedly more predictable in-context (lower higher-order conditional entropies), indicating that tokenization absorbs substantial short-range regularity although these gains degrade under train-test domain mismatch. To ground these observations, we first benchmark i) pretrained GPT-family tokenizers as black-box compressors across various domains, and ii) learned tokenizers across configurations spanning vocabulary size, training scale, and domain. Next, we study tokenization as a transform for universal compression and introduce a compression-aware BPE variant. Finally, we adopt a channel lens and introduce capacity-utilization metrics to analyze tokenizer behaviour and outline implications for downstream modeling. Put together, our results expose various trade-offs between compression, induced structure, and robustness under domain shift, and motivate principled, compression-aware tokenizer design.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Mono- and Bi-static OFDM-ISAC via BS-UE Cooperation: Closed-Form CRLB and Coverage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid mono- and bi-static sensing framework, by leveraging the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) cooperation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This scheme is built on 3GPP-supported sensing modes, and it does not incur any extra spectrum cost or inter-cell coordination. To reveal the fundamental performance limit of the proposed hybrid sensing mode, we derive closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing target localization and velocity estimation, as functions of target and UE positions. The results reveal that significant performance gains can be achieved over the purely mono- or bi-static sensing, especially when the BS-target-UE form a favorable geometry, which is close to a right triangle. The analytical results are validated by simulations using effective parameter estimation algorithm and weighted mean square error (MSE) fusion method. Based on the derived sensing bound, we further analyze the sensing coverage by varying the UE positions, which shows that sensing coverage first improves then degrades as the BS-UE separation increases. Furthermore, the sensing accuracy for a potential target with best UE selection is derived as a function of the UE density in the network.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Shadow: Bending Airy Beams for Radiative Near-Field Multi-User Access in Half-Space Blockage Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

      <title>The .serva Standard: One Primitive for All AI Cost Reduced, Barriers Removed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure faces two compounding crises. Compute payload - the unsustainable energy and capital costs of training and inference - threatens to outpace grid capacity and concentrate capability among a handful of organizations. Data chaos - the 80% of project effort consumed by preparation, conversion, and preprocessing - strangles development velocity and locks datasets to single model architectures. Current approaches treat these as separate problems, managing each with incremental optimization while increasing ecosystem complexity. This paper presents ServaStack: a universal data format (.serva) paired with a universal AI compute engine (Chimera). The .serva format achieves lossless compression by encoding information using laser holography principles, while Chimera converts compute operations into a representational space where computation occurs directly on .serva files without decompression. The result is automatic data preprocessing. The Chimera engine enables any existing model to operate on .serva data without retraining, preserving infrastructure investments while revamping efficiency. Internal benchmarks demonstrate 30-374x energy efficiency improvements (96-99% reduction), 4x-34x lossless storage compression, and 68x compute payload reduction without accuracy loss when compared to RNN, CNN, and MLP models on FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets. At hyperscale with one billion daily iterations, these gains translate to $4.85M savings per petabyte per training cycle. When any data flows to any model on any hardware, the AI development paradigm shifts. The bottleneck moves from infrastructure to imagination.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Assisted Dual-Polarized Multi-Cell Cooperative AirComp: An Alternating Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a key enabler for distributed optimization, since it leverages analog waveform superposition to perform aggregation and thereby mitigates the communication bottleneck caused by iterative information exchange. However, AirComp is sensitive to wireless environment and conventional systems with fixed single-polarized base-station arrays cannot fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom while also suffering from polarization mismatch. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-cell cooperative air-computation framework assisted by dual-polarized movable antennas (D-PMA), and formulates a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the combining matrix, polarization vectors, antenna positions, and user transmit coefficients. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex, so an alternating algorithm is developed in which closed-form updates are obtained for the combining matrix and transmit coefficients. Then a method based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed to refine polarization vectors, and the antenna positions are updated using a gradient-based method. In addition, we develop a statistical-channel-based scheme for optimizing the antenna locations, and we further present the corresponding algorithm to efficiently obtain the solution. Numerical results show that the proposed movable dual-polarized scheme consistently outperforms movable single-polarized and fixed-antenna baselines under both instantaneous and statistical channels.</description>

      <title>Reducing The Sub-packetization Level of Optimal-Access Cooperative MSR Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative MSR codes are a kind of storage codes which enable optimal-bandwidth repair of any $h\geq2$ node erasures in a cooperative way, while retaining the minimum storage as an $[n,k]$ MDS code. Each code coordinate (node) is assumed to store an array of $\ell$ symbols, where $\ell$ is termed as sub-packetization. Large sub-packetization tends to induce high complexity, large input/output in practice. To address the disk IO capability, a cooperative MSR code is said to have optimal-access property, if during node repair, the amount of data accessed at each helper node meets a theoretical lower bound.
  In this paper, we focus on reducing the sub-packetization of optimal-access cooperative MSR codes with two erasures. At first, we design two crucial MDS array codes for repairing a specific repair pattern of two erasures with optimal access. Then, using the two codes as building blocks and by stacking up of the two codes for several times, we obtain an optimal-access cooperative MSR code with two erasures. The derived code has sub-packetization $\ell=r^{\binom{n}{2}-\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor(\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ where $r=n-k$, and it reduces $\ell$ by a fraction of $1/r^{\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor(\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ compared with the state of the art ($\ell=r^{\binom{n}{2}}$).</description>

      <title>Second-Order Asymptotics of Two-Sample Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-sampling testing, one observes two independent sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables distributed according to the distributions $P_1$ and $P_2$ and wishes to decide whether $P_1=P_2$ (null hypothesis) or $P_1\neq P_2$ (alternative hypothesis). The Gutman test for this problem compares the empirical distributions of the observed sequences and decides on the null hypothesis if the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between these empirical distributions is below a given threshold. This paper proposes a generalization of the Gutman test, termed \emph{divergence test}, which replaces the JS divergence by an arbitrary divergence. For this test, the exponential decay of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability is studied. First, it is shown that the divergence test achieves the optimal first-order exponent, irrespective of the choice of divergence. Second, it is demonstrated that the divergence test with an invariant divergence achieves the same second-order asymptotics as the Gutman test. In addition, it is shown that the Gutman test is the GLRT for the two-sample testing problem, and a connection between two-sample testing and robust goodness-of-fit testing is established.</description>

      <title>On Polar Coding with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of polar codes with the assistance of feedback in communication systems. Although it is well known that feedback does not improve the capacity of memoryless channels, we show that the finite length performance of polar codes can be significantly improved as feedback enables genie-aided decoding and allows more flexible thresholds for the polar coding construction. To analyze the performance under the new construction, we then propose an accurate characterization of the distribution of the error event under the genie-aided successive cancellation (SC) decoding. This characterization can be also used to predict the performance of the standard SC decoding of polar codes with rates close to capacity.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Rate-Distortion Limits in Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel systematic theoretical framework to analyze the rate-distortion (R-D) limits of learned image compression. While recent neural codecs have achieved remarkable empirical results, their distance from the information-theoretic limit remains unclear. Our work addresses this gap by decomposing the R-D performance loss into three key components: variance estimation, quantization strategy, and context modeling. First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem. Third, we extend our framework to include context modeling, and demonstrate that accurate mean prediction yields substantial entropy reduction. Unlike prior R-D estimators, our method provides a structurally interpretable perspective that aligns with real compression modules and enables fine-grained analysis. Through joint simulation and end-to-end training, we derive a tight and actionable approximation of the theoretical R-D limits, offering new insights into the design of more efficient learned compression systems.</description>

      <title>Regenerating codes with minimal disk I/O cost achieving optimal tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple performance metrics in the design of coding schemes for distributed storage systems. The first metric is called repair bandwidth, which measures the network resources required during the repair process. Another critical metric for repair efficiency is disk I/O cost, defined as the amount of data packets accessed at helper nodes to repair the failed node. In an encoding scheme with optimal I/O cost, the number of packets sent to the newcomer is exactly the same as the number of packets read from memory. This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Proof of the Radon-Nikodym Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radon-Nikodym theorem plays a significant role in the definition of Shannon entropy, f-divergences, and other basic quantities in information theory. The existence of Radon Nikodym derivates appear in many text books in measure theory but in text books on probability or information theory it is often omitted because the proof is often considered to be too difficult.</description>

      <title>Contraction of R\'enyi Divergences for Discrete Channels: Properties and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores properties of Strong Data-Processing constants for R\'enyi Divergences. Parallels are made with the well-studied $\varphi$-Divergences, and it is shown that the order $\alpha$ of R\'enyi Divergences dictates whether certain properties of the contraction of $\varphi$-Divergences are mirrored or not. In particular, we demonstrate that when $\alpha&gt;1$, the contraction properties can deviate quite strikingly from those of $\varphi$-Divergences. We also uncover specific characteristics of contraction for the $\infty$-R\'enyi Divergence and relate it to $\varepsilon$-Local Differential Privacy. The results are then applied to bound the speed of convergence of Markov chains, where we argue that the contraction of R\'enyi Divergences offers a new perspective on the contraction of $L^\alpha$-norms commonly studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schalkwijk-Kailath Coding for Autoregressive Gaussian Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Gaussian random coding scheme for AR($p$) Gaussian channels that generalizes the celebrated Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) coding scheme. This constructive coding scheme, termed the SK(2) coding scheme, yields a closed-form characterization for the corresponding achievable rate. Among many others, this result shows that the celebrated SK coding scheme is not universally optimal, and therefore, disprove the conjecture proposed by Butman in \cite{butman1976linear}.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Method to Minimize the Index of Coincidence under Marginal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the index of coincidence of a joint distribution under fixed marginal constraints. This objective is motivated by several applications in information theory, where the index of coincidence naturally arises. A closed-form solution is known when the marginals satisfy a strong feasibility condition, but this condition is rarely met in practice. We first show that the measure of the set of marginals for which condition applies vanishes as the dimension grows. We then characterize the structure of the optimal coupling in the general case, proving that it exhibits a monotone staircase of zero entries. Based on this structure, we propose an explicit iterative construction and prove that it converges in finitely many steps to a minimizer. Main result of the paper is a complete constructive solution of index-of-coincidence minimization.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Rate Bounds and Constructions for the Inclusive Variant of Disjunct Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disjunct matrices, also known as cover-free families and superimposed codes, are combinatorial arrays widely used in group testing. Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction. These results clarify the asymptotic potential of robust and scalable group testing under the general inhibitor complex model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BiD codes, which are a new family of algebraic codes of length $3^m$, achieve the erasure channel capacity under bit-MAP decoding and offer asymptotically larger minimum distance than Reed-Muller (RM) codes. In this paper we propose fast maximum-likelihood (ML) and max-log-MAP decoders for first-order BiD codes. For second-order codes, we identify their minimum-weight parity checks and ascertain a code property known as 'projection' in the RM coding literature. We use these results to design a belief propagation decoder that performs within 1 dB of ML decoder for block lengths 81 and 243.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified interpretation of $\alpha$-mutual information ($\alpha$-MI) in terms of generalized $g$-leakage. Specifically, we present a novel interpretation of $\alpha$-MI within an extended framework for quantitative information flow based on adversarial generalized decision problems. This framework employs the Kolmogorov-Nagumo mean and the $q$-logarithm to characterize adversarial gain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, within this framework, the parameter $\alpha$ can be interpreted as a measure of the adversary's risk aversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Dobrushin coefficients of discrete Markov kernels that have bounded pointwise maximal leakage (PML) with respect to all distributions with a minimum probability mass bounded away from zero by a constant $c&gt;0$. This definition recovers local differential privacy (LDP) for $c\to 0$. We derive achievable bounds on contraction in terms of a kernels PML guarantees, and provide mechanism constructions that achieve the presented bounds. Further, we extend the results to general $f$-divergences by an application of Binette's inequality. Our analysis yields tighter bounds for mechanisms satisfying LDP and extends beyond the LDP regime to any discrete kernel.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Randomised List Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies random-coding error exponents of randomised list decoding, in which the decoder randomly selects $L$ messages with probabilities proportional to the decoding metric of the codewords. The exponents (or bounds) are given for mismatched, and then particularised to matched and universal decoding metrics. Two regimes are studied: for fixed list size, we derive an ensemble-tight random-coding error exponent, and show that, for the matched metric, it does not improve the error exponent of ordinary decoding. For list sizes growing exponentially with the block-length, we provide a non-trivial lower bound to the error exponent that is tight at high rates under the matched metric.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Sample Strong Converse for Binary Hypothesis Testing via (Reverse) R\'enyi Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates binary hypothesis testing between $H_0\sim P_0$ and $H_1\sim P_1$ in the finite-sample regime under asymmetric error constraints. By employing the ``reverse" R\'enyi divergence, we derive novel non-asymptotic bounds on the Type II error probability which naturally establish a strong converse result. Furthermore, when the Type I error is constrained to decay exponentially with a rate $c$, we show that the Type II error converges to 1 exponentially fast if $c$ exceeds the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D(P_1\|P_0)$, and vanishes exponentially fast if $c$ is smaller. Finally, we present numerical examples demonstrating that the proposed converse bounds strictly improve upon existing finite-sample results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the estimation problem for jointly stable random variables. Under two specific dependency models: a linear transformation of two independent stable variables and a sub-Gaussian symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) vector, we show that the conditional mean estimator is linear in both cases. Moreover, we find dispersion optimal linear estimators. Interestingly, for the sub-Gaussian (S$\alpha$S) vector, both estimators are identical generalizing the well-known Gaussian result of the conditional mean being the best linear minimum-mean square estimator.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Representations Of The Simple Hypothesis Testing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convex conjugate (i.e., the Legendre transform) of Type II error probability (volume) as a function of Type I error probability (volume) is determined for the hypothesis testing problem with randomized detectors. The derivation relies on properties of likelihood ratio quantiles and is general enough to extend to the case of $\sigma$-finite measures in all non-trivial cases. The convex conjugate of the Type II error volume, called the primitive entropy spectrum, is expressed as an integral of the complementary distribution function of the likelihood ratio using a standard spectral identity. The resulting dual characterization of the Type II error volume leads to state of the art bounds for the case of product measures via Berry--Esseen theorem through a brief analysis relying on properties of the Gaussian Mills ratio, both with and without tilting.</description>

      <title>On the Error Probability of RPA Decoding of Reed-Muller Codes over BMS Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of the Recursive Projection-Aggregation (RPA) decoder of Ye and Abbe (2020), for Reed-Muller (RM) codes, over general binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. Our work is a significant generalization of a recent result of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025) that showed that the RPA decoder provably achieves vanishing error probabilities for "low-rate" RM codes, over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). While a straightforward generalization of the proof strategy in that paper will require additional, restrictive assumptions on the BMS channel, our technique, which employs an equivalence between the RPA projection operation and a part of the "channel combining" phase in polar codes, requires no such assumptions. Interestingly, such an equivalence allows for the use of a generic union bound on the error probability of the first-order RM code (the "base case" of the RPA decoder), under maximum-likelihood decoding, which holds for any BMS channel. We then exploit these observations in the proof strategy outlined in the work of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025), and argue that, much like in the case of the BSC, one can obtain vanishing error probabilities, in the large $n$ limit (where $n$ is the blocklength), for RM orders that scale roughly as $\log \log n$, for all BMS channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize secret-sharing models that rely on correlated randomness and public communication, originally designed for a fixed access structure, to support a sequence of dynamic access structures, which we term an Additive Access Structure. Specifically, the access structure is allowed to monotonically grow by having any subset of participants added to it at a given time step, and the dealer only learns of these changes to the access structure on the time step that they occur. For this model, we prove the existence of a secret sharing strategy that achieves the same secret rate at each time step as the best known strategy for the fixed access structure version of this model. We also prove that there exists a strategy that is capacity-achieving at any time step where the access structure is a threshold access structure.</description>

      <title>Counting and Entropy Bounds for Structure-Avoiding Spatially-Coupled LDPC Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing large coupling memory quasi-cyclic spatially-coupled LDPC (QC-SC-LDPC) codes with low error floors requires eliminating specific harmful substructures (e.g., short cycles) induced by edge spreading and lifting. Building on our work~\cite{r15} that introduced a Clique Lov\'asz Local Lemma (CLLL)-based design principle and a Moser--Tardos (MT)-type constructive approach, this work quantifies the size and structure of the feasible design space. Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explicit lower bounds on the number of partition matrices satisfying a given family of structure-avoidance constraints, and further obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent solutions under row/column permutations. Moreover, via R\'enyi-entropy bounds for the MT distribution, we provide a computable lower bound on the number of distinct solutions that the MT algorithm can output, giving a concrete diversity guarantee for randomized constructions. Specializations for eliminating 4-cycle candidates yield closed-form bounds as functions of system parameters, offering a principled way to size memory/lifting and to estimate the remaining search space.</description>

      <title>Progress on the Courtade-Kumar Conjecture: Optimal High-Noise Entropy Bounds and Generalized Coordinate-wise Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Courtade-Kumar conjecture posits that dictatorship functions maximize the mutual information between the function's output and a noisy version of its input over the Boolean hypercube. We present two significant advancements related to this conjecture. First, we resolve an open question posed by Courtade and Kumar, proving that for any Boolean function (regardless of bias), the sum of mutual information between the function's output and the individual noisy input coordinates is bounded by $1-H(\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the noise parameter of the Binary Symmetric Channel. This generalizes their previous result which was restricted to balanced Boolean functions. Second, we advance the study of the main conjecture in the high noise regime. We establish an optimal error bound of $O(\lambda^2)$ for the asymptotic entropy expansion, where $\lambda = (1-2\alpha)^2$, improving upon the previous best-known bounds. This refined analysis leads to a sharp, linear Fourier concentration bound for highly informative functions and significantly extends the range of the noise parameter $\lambda$ for which the conjecture is proven to hold.</description>

      <title>No Universal Hyperbola: A Formal Disproof of the Epistemic Trade-Off Between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formally disprove a recently conjectured artificial intelligence trade-off between epistemic certainty and scope in the universal hyperbolic product form in which it was published. Certainty is defined as the worst-case correctness probability over the input space, and scope as the sum of the Kolmogorov complexities of the input and output sets. Using standard facts from coding theory and algorithmic information theory, we show, first, that when the conjecture is instantiated with prefix (self-delimiting, prefix-free) Kolmogorov complexity, it leads to an internal inconsistency, and second, that when it is instantiated with plain Kolmogorov complexity, it is refuted by a constructive counterexample. These results establish a general theorem: contrary to the conjecture's claim, no universal "certainty-scope" hyperbola holds as a general bound under the published definitions.</description>

Abstract: The cell-free networking paradigm constitutes a revolutionary architecture for future generations of wireless networks, which has been recently considered in synergy with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), a promising physical-layer technology for signal propagation programmability. In this paper, we focus on wideband cell-free multi-RIS-empowered Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) systems and present a decentralized cooperative active and passive beamforming scheme, aiming to provide an efficient alternative towards the cooperation overhead of available centralized schemes depending on central processing unit. Considering imperfect channel information availability and realistic frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's element response, we devise a distributed optimization approach based on consensus updates for the RISs' phase configurations. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed distributed design is superior to centralized schemes that are based on various Lorentzian-type wideband modeling approaches for the RISs.</description>

      <title>Lean Clients, Full Accuracy: Hybrid Zeroth- and First-Order Split Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables collaborative training between resource-constrained edge devices and a compute-rich server. Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>The PRODSAT phase of random quantum satisfiability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-QSAT problem is a quantum analog of the famous $k$-SAT constraint satisfaction problem. We must determine the zero energy ground states of a Hamiltonian of $N$ qubits consisting of a sum of $M$ random $k$-local rank-one projectors. It is known that product states of zero energy exist with high probability if and only if the underlying factor graph has a clause-covering dimer configuration. This means that the threshold of the PRODSAT phase is a purely geometric quantity equal to the dimer covering threshold. We revisit and fully prove this result through a combination of complex analysis and algebraic methods based on Buchberger's algorithm for complex polynomial equations with random coefficients. We also discuss numerical experiments investigating the presence of entanglement in the PRODSAT phase in the sense that product states do not span the whole zero energy ground state space.</description>

      <title>Game of Coding: Sybil Resistant Decentralized Machine Learning with Minimal Trust Assumption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coding theory plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and reliability across various domains, from communication to computation and storage systems. However, its reliance on trust assumptions for data recovery, which requires the number of honest nodes to exceed adversarial nodes by a certain margin, poses significant challenges, particularly in emerging decentralized systems where trust is a scarce resource. To address this, the game of coding framework was introduced, offering insights into strategies for data recovery within incentive-oriented environments. In such environments, participant nodes are rewarded as long as the system remains functional (live). This incentivizes adversaries to maximize their rewards (utility) by ensuring that the decoder, as the data collector (DC), successfully recovers the data, preferably with a high estimation error. This rational behavior is leveraged in a game-theoretic framework, where the equilibrium leads to a robust and resilient system, referred to as the game of coding. The focus of the earliest version of the game of coding was limited to scenarios involving only two nodes. In this paper, we generalize the game of coding framework to scenarios with $N \ge 2$ nodes, exploring critical aspects of system behavior. Specifically, we (i) demonstrate that the adversary's utility at equilibrium is non-increasing with additional adversarial nodes, ensuring no gain for the adversary and no pain for the DC, thus establishing the game of coding framework's Sybil resistance; (ii) show that increasing the number of honest nodes does not always enhance the DC's utility, providing examples and proposing an algorithm to identify and mitigate this counterintuitive effect; and (iii) outline the optimal strategies for both the DC and the adversary, demonstrating that the system achieves enhanced liveness at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>From Bayesian Asymptotics to General Large-Scale MIMO Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unifying framework that bridges Bayesian asymptotics and information theory to analyze the asymptotic Shannon capacity of general large-scale MIMO channels including ones with nonlinearities or imperfect hardware. We derive both an analytic capacity formula and an asymptotically optimal input distribution in the large-antenna regime, each of which depends solely on the single-output channel's Fisher information through a term we call the (tilted) Jeffreys factor. We demonstrate how our method applies broadly to scenarios with clipping, coarse quantization (including 1-bit ADCs), phase noise, fading with imperfect CSI, and even optical Poisson channels. Our asymptotic analysis motivates a practical approach to constellation design via a compander-like transformation. Furthermore, we introduce a low-complexity receiver structure that approximates the log-likelihood by quantizing the channel outputs into finitely many bins, enabling near-capacity performance with computational complexity independent of the output dimension. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method unifies and simplifies many previously intractable MIMO capacity problems and reveals how the Fisher information alone governs the channel's asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Bandwidth-Efficient Semantic Communication with Adaptive Requests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on conveying the intrinsic meaning of data rather than its raw symbolic representation. For visual content, this paradigm shifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic structure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches are dominated by two routes: using text-only descriptions, which typically under-specify spatial layout and fine-grained appearance details; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which can over-specify semantics and introduce redundancy and bitrate overhead. A key challenge, therefore, is to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and visual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper introduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive retransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a limited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based inpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency mechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image and the original text description. When a semantic discrepancy is detected, the receiver triggers a retransmission to request a small set of additional latent blocks and refine the image reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth usage while preserving high semantic accuracy, achieving an efficient balance between reconstruction quality and transmission cost.</description>

      <title>Random Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Uplink Covert Communication in MIMO GEO Satellite-Terrestrial Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the uplink covert communication in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite-terrestrial system consisting of an Earth station transmitter Alice, a geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellite receiver Bob, and multiple GEO satellite wardens around Bob, where each node in the system is equipped with an array of directional antennas. Based on beamforming and the default antenna orientation setting, we first propose a scheme for covert Alice-Bob uplink transmission. Under the perfect channel estimation scenario, we provide theoretical modeling for the system performance in terms of detection error probability (DEP), transmission outage probability (TOP) and covert rate (CR), and then explore the optimal beamforming (OB) design as well as the joint optimal beamforming and antenna orientation (JO-BA) design for CR maximization. We then extend our study to the imperfect channel estimation scenario, and conduct related performance modeling and OB/JO-BA designs for CR maximization. We also apply the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, alternating optimization, Rodrigues' rotation formula and 1-D search algorithm to develop efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problems. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical results and to illustrate the efficiency of beamforming and antenna orientation design for supporting the uplink covert communication in MIMO GEO satellite-terrestrial systems.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews: A Deep Dive into Modern Techniques and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis methods for movie reviews, a benchmark task that has played a central role in advancing natural language processing. We review the evolution of techniques from early lexicon-based and classical machine learning approaches to modern deep learning architectures and large language models, covering widely used datasets such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and SST-2, and models ranging from Naive Bayes and support vector machines to LSTM networks, BERT, and attention-based transformers. Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data.</description>

Abstract: In the literature, it has been shown that the secrecy capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) wiretap channel with noise-free feedback equals the capacity of the same model without secrecy constraint, and the classical Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) scheme achieves the secrecy capacity. In this paper, we show that in finite blocklength regime, the SK scheme is not optimal, and propose a modified SK scheme which may perform better than the classical one. Besides this, this paper establishes a finite blocklength converse for the AWGN wiretap channel with feedback, which can also be viewed as a converse for the same model without secrecy constraint. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to address such a problem, and the results of this paper are further explained via numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrate-and-fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wasserstein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum MIMO Receivers for The Multi-User Uplink</title>

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), as well as in the standard quantum limit (SQL) and photon shot limit (PSL) regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we unveil that the EAR scales logarithmically without bound with the product of effective number $N_{\text{atom}}$ and coherence time $T_2$ of the atomic ensemble in the SQL regime, but exhibits non-monotonic trade-off between the collective atomic enhancement and optical-depth-dependent attenuation in the PSL regime. More particularly, the transmit power of users can be scaled down quadratically with $N_{\text{atom}} \tau$, $\tau \in \{ T_2, \frac{ {\cal C} (\Omega_{\ell}) }{A_p} \}$, but the EAR per user retains fixed, by increasing $N_{\text{atom}}$ while retaining the sensor number $M \propto N_{\text{atom}} \tau$ in the SQL regime or $M \propto \exp \big( \frac{N_{\text{atom}} {\bar \chi}}{A_p} \big)$ in the PSL regime....</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments in which fault-tolerant devices access uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Introducing the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP''), we model noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot generally error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we prove that while noise can eliminate the exponential quantum learning advantages of unphysical, noiseless learners, a superpolynomial gap remains between $\textsf{NISQ}$ and fault-tolerant devices. Turning to canonical learning tasks in noisy settings, we find that the exponential two-copy advantage for purity testing collapses under local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient physical structure restores this quantum learning advantage. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds characterizing how instance size, quantum memory and noise jointly control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically matching scalings. We study similar tradeoffs in quantum metrology, and show that the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity of existing error-correction-based protocols persists only up to a timescale inverse-polynomial in the error rate per probe qubit. Together, our results demonstrate that the primitives underlying quantum-enhanced experiments are fundamentally fragile to noise, and that realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require interfacing noise-robust physical properties with available algorithmic techniques.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824</link>

Abstract: Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</description>
