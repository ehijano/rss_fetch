      <title>The Method of Invariant Sets of Descending Flow for Locally Lipschitz Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of invariant sets of descending flow that proposed by Sun Jingxian for smooth functionals to the locally Lipschitz functionals. By this way, we obtain the existence results for the positive, negative and sign-changing critical points of the locally Lipschitz functionals, and apply these theoretical results to the study of differential inclusion problems with p-Laplacian. In order to obtain the above results,we develop some new techniques: 1) We establish the method of how to extend the pseudo-gradient field to the whole space on the premise of preserving the useful information of the local pseudo-gradient field; 2) In the case of set-valued mapping, a pseudo-gradient field is established to make both the cone and the negative cone being invariant sets of descending flow. To obtain our main results, a new class of (PS) condition is also proposed.</description>

      <title>The two membranes problem in a regular tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the two membranes problem for operators given in terms of a mean value formula on a regular tree. We show existence of solutions under adequate conditions on the boundary data and the involved source terms. We also show that, when the boundary data are strictly separated, the coincidence set is separated from the boundary and thus it contains only a finite number of nodes.</description>

      <title>Regularization Techniques for Estimating the Source in a Complete Parabolic Equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the problem of identifying the source term in transport processes given by a complete parabolic equation is studied mathematically from noisy measurements taken at an arbitrary fixed time. The problem is solved analytically with Fourier techniques and it is shown that this solution is not stable. Three single parameter families of regularization operators are proposed to dealt with the instability of the solution. Each of them is designed to compensate the factor that causes the instability of the inverse operator. Moreover, a rule of choice for the regularization parameter is included and a H\"older error bound type is obtained for each estimation. Numerical examples of different characteristics are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Thermo-elastodynamics of finitely-strained multipolar viscous solids with an energy-controlled stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamical model of viscoelastic deformable solids at finite strains with Kelvin-Voigt rheology with a higher-order viscosity (using the concept of multipolar materials) is formulated in a fully Eulerian way in rates. Assumptions used in this paper allow for a physically justified free energy leading to non-negative entropy that satisfies the 3rd law of thermodynamics, i.e. entropy vanishes at zero temperature, and energy-controlled stress. This last attribute is used advantageously to prove the existence and a certain regularity of weak solutions by a simplified Faedo-Galerkin semi-discretization, based on estimates obtained from the total-energy and the mechanical-energy balances. Some examples that model neo-Hookean-type materials are presented, too.</description>

      <title>Mild solutions to the 3D-Boussinesq system with weakened initial temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the Cauchy problem of the 3D viscous Boussinesq system is studied considering an initial temperature with negative Sobolev regularity. Precisely, we construct local in time mild solutions to this system where the temperature term belongs to Sobolev spaces of negative order. Our main contribution is to show how the coupled structure of the Boussinesq system allows us to considerably weaken the regularity in the temperature term.</description>

      <title>Nirenberg problem on high dimensional spheres: Blow up with residual mass phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the analysis of the subcritical approximation of the Nirenberg problem on spheres recently conducted in \cite{MM19, MM}. Specifically, we delve into the scenario where the sequence of blowing up solutions exhibits a non-zero weak limit, which necessarily constitutes a solution of the Nirenberg problem itself. Our focus lies in providing a comprehensive description of such blowing up solutions, including precise determinations of blow-up points and blow-up rates. Additionally, we compute the topological contribution of these solutions to the difference in topology between the level sets of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional. Such an analysis is intricate due to the potential degeneracy of the involved solutions. We also provide a partial converse, wherein we construct blowing up solutions when the weak limit is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation for the Lotka-Volterra competition model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the bifurcation phenomenon for the following two-component competition system:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1=\mu u_1(1-u_1)-\beta \alpha u_1u_2,&amp; \text{in}\ B_1\subset \mathbb{R}^N,
  -\Delta u_2=\sigma u_2(1-u_2)-\beta \gamma u_1u_2,&amp; \text{in}\ B_1\subset \mathbb{R}^N,
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n}= \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} =0,&amp;\text{on}\ \partial B_1,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
where $N\ge 2$, $\alpha&gt;\gamma&gt;0$, $\sigma\ge\mu&gt;0$ and $\beta&gt;\frac{\sigma}{\gamma}$. More precisely, treating $\beta$ as the bifurcation parameter, we initially perform a local bifurcation analysis around the positive constant solutions, obtaining precise information of where bifurcation could occur, and determine the direction of bifurcation. As a byproduct, the instability of the constant solution is provided. Furthermore, we extend our exploration to the global bifurcation analysis.
  Lastly, under the condition $\sigma=\mu$, we demonstrate the limiting configuration on each bifurcation branch as the competition rate $\beta\rightarrow+\infty$.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of 2D stationary particle systems with signed Coulombian interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limits of critical points of interaction energies with Coulombian singularity. An important feature of our setting is that we allow interaction between particles of opposite signs. Particles of opposite signs attract each other whereas particles of the same signs repel each other. In 2D, we prove that the associated empirical measures converge to a limiting measure $\mu$ that satisfies a two-fold criticality condition: in velocity form or in vorticity form. Our setting includes the stationary attraction-repulsion problem with Coulombian singularity and the stationary system of point-vortices in fluid mechanics. In this last context, in the case where the limiting measure is in $H^{-1}_{\text{loc}}({\mathbb R}^2)$, we recover the classical criticality condition stating that $\nabla^\perp g \ast \mu$, with $g(x)=-\log |x|$, is a stationary solution of the incompressible Euler equation. This result, is, to the best of our knowledge, new in the case of particles with different signs (for particles of the positive sign it was obtained by Schochet in 1996). In order to derive the limiting criticality condition in the velocity form, we follow an approach devised by Sandier-Serfaty in the context of Ginzburg-Landau vortices. This consists of passing to the limit in the stress-energy tensor associated with the velocity field. On the other hand, the criticality condition in the vorticity form is obtained by arguments closer to the ones of Schochet.</description>

      <title>A Nonnegative Weak Solution to the Phase Field Crystal Model with Degenerate Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase field crystal is a model used to describe the behavior of crystalline materials at the mesoscale. In this study, we investigate the well-posedness of a phase field crystal equation subject to a degenerate mobility $M(u)$ that equals zero for $u\leq 0$. First, we prove the existence of a weak solution to a phase field crystal equation with non-degenerate cutoff mobility. Then, assuming that the initial data $u_0(x)$ is positive, we establish the existence of a nonnegative weak solution to the degenerate case. Such solution is the limit of solutions corresponding to non-degenerate mobilities. We also verify that such a weak solution satisfies an energy dissipation inequality.</description>

      <title>Topological Equatorial Waves and Violation (or not) of the Bulk Edge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric and oceanic mass transport near the equator display a well-studied asymmetry characterized by two modes moving eastward. This asymmetric edge transport is characteristic of interfaces separating two-dimensional topological insulators. The northern and southern hemispheres are insulating because of the presence of a Coriolis force parameter that vanishes only in the vicinity of the equator. A central tenet of topological insulators, the bulk edge correspondence, relates the quantized edge asymmetry to bulk properties of the insulating phases, which makes it independent of the Coriolis force profile near the equator. We show that for a natural differential Hamiltonian model of the atmospheric and oceanic transport, the bulk-edge correspondence does not always apply. In fact, an arbitrary quantized asymmetry can be obtained for specific, discontinuous, such profiles. The results are based on a careful analysis of the spectral flow of the branches of absolutely continuous spectrum of a shallow-water Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a global bifurcation result for the existence of non-radial branches of solutions to the paramterized family of $\Gamma$-symmetric problems $-\Delta u=f(\alpha,z,u)$, $u|_{\partial D}=0$ on the unit disc $D:=\{z\in \mathbb{C} : |z|&lt;1\}$ with $u(z)\in \mathbb{R}^k$, where $\mathbb{R}^k$ is an orthogonal $\Gamma$-representation, $f: \mathbb{R} \times \overline{D} \times \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^k$ is a sub-linear $\Gamma$-equivariant continuous function, differentiable with respect to $u$ at zero and satisfying the conditions $f(\alpha, e^{i\theta}z,u)=f(\alpha, z,u)$ for all $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(z,-u)=-f(z,u)$.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic dynamics of phase interfaces in bilinear forward-backward diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single-interface solutions to a free boundary problem that couples bilinear bulk diffusion to the Stefan condition and a hysteretic flow rule for phase boundaries. We introduce a time-discrete approximation scheme and establish its convergence in the limit of vanishing step size. The main difficulty in our proof are strong microscopic oscillations which are produced by a propagating phase interface and need to be controlled on the macroscopic scale. We also present numerical simulations and discuss the link to the viscous regularization of ill-posed diffusion equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some results on the density and multiplicity of positive solutions to the prescribed Webster scalar curvature problem on the $(2n+1)$-dimensional standard unit CR sphere $(\mathbb{S} ^{2n+1},\theta_0)$. Specifically, we construct arbitrarily many multi-bump solutions via the variational gluing method. In particular, we show the Webster scalar curvature functions of contact forms conformal to $\theta_0$ are $C^{0}$-dense among bounded functions which are positive somewhere. Existence results of infinitely many positive solutions to the related equation $-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}} u=R(\xi) u^{(n+2) /n}$ on the Heisenberg group $\Hn $ with $R(\xi)$ being asymptotically periodic with respect to left translation are also obtained. Our proofs make use of a refined analysis of bubbling behavior, gradient flow, Pohozaev identity, as well as blow up arguments.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation in the Mean-Field Limit of Kinetic Flocking Models with Local Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative particle system characterized by moderate interactions, designed to accurately approximate kinetic flocking models that incorporate singular interaction forces and local alignment mechanisms. We establish the existence of weak solutions to the corresponding flocking equations and provide an error estimate for the mean-field limit. This is achieved through the regularization of singular forces and a nonlocal approximation strategy for local alignments. We show that, by selecting the regularization and localization parameters logarithmically with respect to the number of particles, the particle system effectively approximates the mean-field equation.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new contraction properties called the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as Clarkson's inequalities, the strong subadditivity and the ``Markov property'' in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying Clarkson's inequalities is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking into consideration the generalized $p$-contraction property, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties for $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of $p$-energy forms are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpets and $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze an abstract thermoelastic system, where the heat conduction follows the Cattaneo law. Zero becomes a spectrum point of the system operator when the coupling and thermal damping parameters of the system satisfy specific conditions. We obtain the decay rates of solutions to the system with or without the inertial term. Furthermore, the decay rate of the system without inertial terms is shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions of a mean field system for pulse-coupled oscillators: long time asymptotics versus blowup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel reformulation of the mean-field system for pulse-coupled oscillators. It is based on writing a closed equation for the inverse distribution function associated to the probability density of oscillators with a given phase in a suitable time scale. This new framework allows to show a hidden contraction/expansion of certain distances leading to a full clarification of the long-time behavior, existence of steady states, rates of convergence, and finite time blow-up of classical solutions for a large class of monotone phase response functions. In the process, we get insights about the origin of obstructions to global-in-time existence and uniform in time estimates on the firing rate of the oscillators.</description>

      <title>Curvature and sharp growth rates of log-quasimodes on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new optimal estimates for the $L^2(M)\to L^q(M)$, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, operator norms of spectral projection operators associated with spectral windows $[\lambda,\lambda+\delta(\lambda)]$, with $\delta(\lambda)=O((\log\lambda)^{-1})$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\ge2$ all of whose sectional curvatures are nonpositive or negative. We show that these two different types of estimates are saturated on flat manifolds or manifolds all of whose sectional curvatures are negative. This allows us to classify compact space forms in terms of the size of $L^q$-norms of quasimodes for each Lebesgue exponent $q\in (2,q_c]$, even though it is impossible to distinguish between ones of negative or zero curvature sectional curvature for any $q&gt;q_c$.</description>

      <title>Quasimode concentration on compact space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the upper bounds for the $L^2$-norms of $L^1$-normalized quasimodes that we obtained in [9] are always sharp on any compact space form. This allows us to characterize compact manifolds of constant sectional curvature using the decay rates of lower bounds of $L^1$-norms of $L^2$-normalized log-quasimodes fully resolving a problem initiated by the second author and Zelditch [15]. We are also able to characterize such manifolds by the concentration of quasimodes near periodic geodesics as measured by $L^2$-norms over thin geodesic tubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss problems that relate curvature and concentration properties of eigenfunctions and quasimodes on compact boundaryless Riemannian manifolds. These include new sharp $L^q$-estimates, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, of log-quasimodes that characterize compact connected space forms in terms of the growth rate of $L^q$-norms of such quasimode for these relatively small Lebesgue exponents $q$.
  No such characterization is possible for any exponent $q&gt; q_c$.</description>

      <title>On illposedness of the Hall and electron magnetohydrodynamic equations without resistivity on the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown in our previous work that the incompressible and irresistive Hall- and electron-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are illposed on flat domains $M = \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{T}^{3-k}$ for $0 \le k \le 2$. The data and solutions therein were assumed to be independent of one coordinate, which not only significantly simplifies the systems but also allows for a large class of steady states. In this work, we remove the assumption of independence and conclude strong illposedness for compactly supported data in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is achieved by constructing degenerating wave packets for linearized systems around time-dependent axisymmetric magnetic fields. A few main additional ingredients are: a more systematic application of the generalized energy estimate, use of the Bogovski\v{i} operator, and a priori estimates for axisymmetric solutions to the Hall- and electron-MHD systems.</description>

      <title>On the existence of ground states to Hartree-type equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a delta potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Hartree-type equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a delta potential formally described by $$ i \partial_t \psi = - \Delta_x \psi + \alpha \delta_0 \psi - (I_\beta \ast |\psi|^p) |\psi|^{p - 2} \psi $$ where $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$; $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 3$ and we want to solve for $\psi \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$. By means of a Poho\v{z}aev identity, we show that if $p = (3 + \beta) / 3$ and $\alpha \geq 0$, then the problem has no ground state at any mass $\mu &gt; 0$. We also prove that if $$ \frac{3 + \beta}{3} &lt; p &lt; \min \left(
  \frac{5 + \beta}{3}, \frac{5 + 2 \beta}{4} \right), $$ which includes the physically-relevant case $p = \beta = 2$, then the problem admits a ground state at any mass $\mu &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the unknown boundary values of a solution of an elliptic equation outside a bounded domain $B$ from the knowledge of the values of this solution on a boundary of an arbitrary bounded domain surrounding $B$. We obtain for this inverse problem Lipschitz stability under an additional hypothesis on the unknown boundary function. This result can be also interpreted as quantitative uniqueness of continuation from the Cauchy data on the boundary of the domain surrounding $B$. Our analysis also applies to an interior problem.</description>

      <title>Normalized grounded states for a coupled nonlinear schr\"{o}dinger system on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of normalized ground states to the system of coupled Schr\"odinger equations: \begin{equation}\label{eq:0.1}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 + \lambda_1 u_1 = \mu_1 |u_1|^{p_1-2}u_1 + \beta r_1|u_1|^{r_1-2}u_1|u_2|^{r_2} &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{3},
  -\Delta u_2 + \lambda_2 u_2 = \mu_2|u_2|^{p_2-2}u_2 + \beta r_2|u_1|^{r_1}|u_2|^{r_2-2}u_2 &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} subject to the constraints $\mathcal{S}_{a_1} \times \mathcal{S}_{a_2} = \{(u_1 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_1^2 dx = a_1^2\} \times \{(u_2 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_2^2 dx = a_2^2\}$, where $\mu_1, \mu_2 &gt; 0$, $r_1, r_2 &gt; 1$, and $\beta \geq 0$. Our focus is on the coupled mass super-critical case, specifically, $$\frac{10}{3} &lt; p_1, p_2, r_1 + r_2 &lt; 2^* = 6.$$ We demonstrate that there exists a $\tilde{\beta} \geq 0$ such that equation (\ref{eq:0.1}) admits positive, radially symmetric, normalized ground state solutions when $\beta &gt; \tilde{\beta}$. Furthermore, this result can be generalized to systems with an arbitrary number of components, and the corresponding standing wave is orbitally unstable.</description>

      <title>Sharp quantitative stability of the Yamabe problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $N \ge 3$, we derive sharp quantitative stability estimates for nonnegative functions near the solution set of the Yamabe problem on $(M,g)$. The seminal work of Struwe (1984) \cite{S} states that if $\Gamma(u) := \|\Delta_g u - \frac{N-2}{4(N-1)} R_g u + u^{\frac{N+2}{N-2}}\|_{H^{-1}(M)} \to 0$, then $\|u-(u_0+\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} \mathcal{V}_i)\|_{H^1(M)} \to 0$ where $u_0$ is a solution to the Yamabe problem on $(M,g)$, $\nu \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$, and $\mathcal{V}_i$ is a bubble-like function. If $M$ is the round sphere $\mathbb{S}^N$, then $u_0 \equiv 0$ and a natural candidate of $\mathcal{V}_i$ is a bubble itself. If $M$ is not conformally equivalent to $\mathbb{S}^N$, then either $u_0 &gt; 0$ or $u_0 \equiv 0$, there is no canonical choice of $\mathcal{V}_i$, and so a careful selection of $\mathcal{V}_i$ must be made to attain optimal estimates.
  For $3 \le N \le 5$, we construct suitable $\mathcal{V}_i$'s and then establish the inequality $\|u-(u_0+\sum_{i=1}^{\nu} \mathcal{V}_i)\|_{H^1(M)}$ $ \le C\zeta(\Gamma(u))$ where $C &gt; 0$ and $\zeta(t) = t$, consistent with the result of Figalli and Glaudo (2020) \cite{FG} on $\mathbb{S}^N$. In the case of $N \ge 6$, we investigate the single-bubbling phenomenon $(\nu = 1)$ on generic Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$, proving that $\zeta(t)$ is determined by $N$, $u_0$, and $g$, and can be much larger than $t$. This exhibits a striking difference from the result of Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi (2018) \cite{CFM} on $\mathbb{S}^N$. All of the estimates presented herein are optimal.</description>

      <title>Strategic geometric graphs through mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of geometric graphs on Riemannian manifolds to analyze strategic dynamic graphs at the limit, when the number of nodes tends to infinity. This framework allows to preserve intrinsic geometrical information about the limiting graph structure, such as the Ollivier curvature. After introducing the setting, we derive a mean field game system, which models a strategic equilibrium between the nodes. It has the usual structure with the distinction of being set on a manifold. Finally, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system when the Hamiltonian is quadratic for a class of non-necessarily compact Riemannian manifolds, referred to as manifolds of bounded geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider perturbations of the one-dimensional cubic Schr\"odinger equation, of the form $i \, \partial_t \psi + \partial_x^2 \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi + g( |\psi|^2 ) \psi = 0$. Under hypotheses on the function $g$ that can be easily verified in some cases (such as $g(s) = s^\sigma$ with $\sigma &gt;1$), we show that the linearized problem around a small solitary wave presents a unique internal mode. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis (the Fermi golden rule) that can also be verified in the case of powers $g(s) = s^\sigma$, we prove the asymptotic stability of the solitary waves with small frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient response from a transmitter-receiver coil system inside a multi-layer cylindrical conductive configuration is obtained. The particular set-up applies to well logging as well as to eddy current tube testing. In this work, a number of improvements are presented to existing models for an efficient calculation of the induced voltage. These include: domain truncation, novel treatment of arbitrary number of layers in order to avoid computational overflows and efficient time response calculation. The latter is based on a combination of Laplace inversion techniques for short- and long-time transient responses. This article is part of the theme issue 'Advanced electromagnetic non-destructive evaluation and smart monitoring'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a Carleman estimate for the higher order partial differential operator. In the process of establishing this estimate, we developed a new method, which is called the back-propagation method (the BPM, for short). This method can also be used to build up Carleman estimates for some other partial differential operators, and might provide assistance with corresponding numerical analyses. As an application of the above-mentioned Carleman estimate, we proved the conditional stability of a Cauchy problem for a time fractional diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>A stochastic population model with hierarchic size-structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchically structured population in which the amount of resources an individual has access to is affected by individuals that are larger, and that the intake of resources by an individual only affects directly the growth rate of the individual. We formulate a deterministic model, which takes the form of a delay equation for the population birth rate. We also formulate an individual based stochastic model, and study the relationship between the two models. In particular the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model is compared to that of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. Since the quasi-stationary birth rate cannot be obtained explicitly, we derive a formula to approximate it. We show that the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model can be obtained as the large population limit of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. This relation suggests that the deterministic model is a good approximation of the stochastic model when the number of individuals is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of diffusion equations with the Caputo time-fractional derivative $\partial_t^\alpha u=L u$ subject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here, we consider a fractional order $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 1$ and a second-order operator $L$ which is elliptic and non-symmetric. In this paper, we show that the logarithmic convexity extends to this non-symmetric case provided that the drift coefficient is given by a gradient vector field. Next, we perform some numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results in both symmetric and non-symmetric cases. Finally, some conclusions and open problems will be mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multi-frequency inverse source problem in the presence of a non-homogeneous medium using passive measurements. Precisely, we derive stability estimates for determining the source from the knowledge of only the imaginary part of the radiated field on the boundary for multiple frequencies. The proof combines a spectral decomposition with a quantification of the unique continuation of the resolvent as a holomorphic function of the frequency. The obtained results show that the inverse problem is well posed when the frequency band is larger than the spatial frequency of the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the measure-valued death state and local sensitivity analysis of the Winfree model and its mean-field counterpart with uncertain high-order couplings. The Winfree model is the first mathematical model for synchronization, and it can cast as the effective approximation of the pulse-coupled model for synchronization, and it exhibits diverse asymptotic patterns depending on system parameters and initial data. For the proposed models, we present several frameworks leading to oscillator death in terms of system parameters and initial data, and the propagation of regularity in random space. We also present several numerical tests and compare them with analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a transport problem on an infinite metric graph and discuss its well-posedness and long-term behaviour under the condition that the mass flow is buffered in at least one of the vertices. In order to show the well-posedness of the problem, we employ the theory of $C_0$-semigroups and prove a Desch--Schappacher type perturbation theorem for dispersive semigroups. Investigating the long-term behaviour of the system, we prove irreducibility of the semigroup under the assumption that the underlying graph is strongly connected and an additional spectral condition on its adjacency matrix. Moreover, we employ recent results about the convergence of stochastic semigroups that dominate a kernel operator to prove that the solutions converge strongly to equilibrium. Finally, we prove that the solutions converge uniformly under more restrictive assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We prove the non-degeneracy of solutions to a fractional and singular Liouville equation defined on the whole real line in presence of a singular term. We use conformal transformations to rewrite the linearized equation as a Steklov eigenvalue problem posed in a bounded domain, which is defined either by an intersection or a union of two disks. We conclude by proving the simplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic stability on the line of ground states of the pure power NLS with $0&lt;|p-3|\ll 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For exponents $p$ satisfying $0&lt;|p-3|\ll 1$ and only in the context of spatially even solutions we prove that the ground states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with pure power nonlinearity of exponent $p$ in the line are asymptotically stable. The proof is similar to a related result of Martel, preprint arXiv:2312.11016, for a cubic quintic NLS. Here we modify the second part of Martel's argument, replacing the second virial inequality for a transformed problem with a smoothing estimate on the initial problem, appropriately tamed by multiplying the initial variables and equations by a cutoff.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rates of discrete solutions to the Wave Kinetic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the long-term behavior of some special solutions to the Wave Kinetic Equation (WKE). This equation provides a mesoscopic description of wave systems interacting nonlinearly via the cubic NLS equation. Escobedo and Vel\'azquez showed that, starting with initial data given by countably many Dirac masses, solutions remain a linear combination of countably many Dirac masses at all times. Moreover, there is convergence to a single Dirac mass at long times. The first goal of this paper is to give quantitative rates for the speed of said convergence. In order to study the optimality of the bounds we obtain, we introduce and analyze a toy model accounting only for the leading order quadratic interactions.</description>

      <title>A mean curvature flow arising in adversarial training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect adversarial training for binary classification to a geometric evolution equation for the decision boundary. Relying on a perspective that recasts adversarial training as a regularization problem, we introduce a modified training scheme that constitutes a minimizing movements scheme for a nonlocal perimeter functional. We prove that the scheme is monotone and consistent as the adversarial budget vanishes and the perimeter localizes, and as a consequence we rigorously show that the scheme approximates a weighted mean curvature flow. This highlights that the efficacy of adversarial training may be due to locally minimizing the length of the decision boundary. In our analysis, we introduce a variety of tools for working with the subdifferential of a supremal-type nonlocal total variation and its regularity properties.</description>

      <title>On the local solvability and stability of the partial inverse problems for the non-self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville operators with a discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse spectral problems for the Sturm-Liouville operators on [0,1] with complex coefficients and a discontinuity at $x=a\in(0,1)$. Assume that the potential on (a,1) and some parameters in the discontinuity and boundary conditions are given. We recover the potential on (0,a) and the other parameters from the eigenvalues. This is the so-called partial inverse problem. The local solvability and stability of the partial inverse problems are obtained for $a\in(0,1)$, in which the error caused by the given partial potential is considered. As a by-product, we also obtain two new uniqueness theorems for the partial inverse problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the crucial yet underexplored stability properties of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation in model-free reinforcement learning contexts, specifically for Lipschitz continuous optimal control problems. We bridge the gap between Lipschitz continuous optimal control problems and classical optimal control problems in the viscosity solutions framework, offering new insights into the stability of the value function of Lipschitz continuous optimal control problems. By introducing structural assumptions on the dynamics and reward functions, we further study the rate of convergence of value functions. Moreover, we introduce a generalized framework for Lipschitz continuous control problems that incorporates the original problem and leverage it to propose a new HJB-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The stability properties and performance of the proposed method are tested with well-known benchmark examples in comparison with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Sundman-Sperling estimates for the restricted one-center-two-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, since the discovery of the figure-8 orbit by Chenciner and Montgomery, the variational method has became one of the most popular tools for constructing new solutions of the $N$-body problem and its extended problems. However, finding solutions to the restricted three-body problem, in particular, the two primaries form a collision Kepler system, remains a great difficulty. One of the major reasons is the essential differences between two-body collisions and three-body collisions.
  In this paper, we consider a similar three-body system with less difficulty, i.e. the restricted one-center-two-body system, that is involving a massless particle and a collision Kepler system with one body fixed. It is an intermediate system between the restricted three-body problem and the two-center problem. By an in-depth analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the minimizer, and an argument of critical and infliction points, we prove the Sundman-Sperling estimates near the three-body collision for the minimizers. With these estimates, we provide a class of collision-free solutions with prescribed boundary angles. Finally, under the extended collision Kepler system from Gordon, we constructed a family of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>A critical drift-diffusion equation: intermittent behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process with a time-independent and divergence-free random drift that is of white-noise character. We are interested in the critical case of two space dimensions, where one has to impose a small-scale cut-off for well-posedness, and is interested in the marginally super-diffusive behavior on large scales.
  In the presence of an (artificial) large-scale cut-off at scale L, as a consequence of standard stochastic homogenization theory, there exist harmonic coordinates with a stationary gradient $F_L$; the merit of these coordinates being that under their lens, the drift-diffusion process turns into a martingale.
  It has recently been established that the second moments diverge as $\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2\sim\sqrt{\ln L}$ for $L\uparrow\infty$. We quantitatively show that in this limit, and in the regime of small P\'eclet number, $|F_L|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2$ is not equi-integrable, and that $\mathbb{E}|{\rm det}F_L|/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2 $ is small. Hence the Jacobian matrix of the harmonic coordinates is very peaked and non-conformal.
  We establish this asymptotic behavior by characterizing a proxy $\tilde F_L$ introduced in previous work as the solution of an It\^{o} SDE w. r. t. the variable $\ln L$, and which implements the concept of a scale-by-scale homogenization based on a variance decomposition and admits an efficient calculus. For this proxy, we establish $\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^4\gg(\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^2)^2$ and $\mathbb{E}({\rm det}\tilde F_L-1)^2\ll 1$. In view of the former property, we assimilate this phenomenon to intermittency. In fact, $\tilde F_L$ behaves like a tensorial stochastic exponential, and as a field can be assimilated to multiplicative Gaussian chaos.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Minkowski type inequality for weakly mean convex and star-shaped hypersurfaces in warped cylinders which are asymptotically flat or hyperbolic. In particular, we show that this sharp inequality holds for outward minimizing hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild manifold or the hyperbolic space using the weak solution of the inverse mean curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the PDE and numerical analysis of a modified one-dimensional intravascular stent model originally proposed in [4]. It is proved that the modified model has a unique weak solution using the Galerkin method combined with a compactness argument. A semi-discrete finite element method and a fully discrete scheme using the Euler time-stepping are formulated for the PDE model. Optimal order error estimates in the energy norm are proved for both schemes. Numerical results are presented along with comparisons between different decoupling strategies and time-stepping schemes. Lastly, extensions of the model and its PDE and numerical analysis results to the two-dimensional case are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new technique to generate reasonable systems of partial differential equations (PDE) that could be potential candidates for depicting models in natural sciences related to quasi-linear equations. Such systems appear within typical constructions of the Homological Algebra as complexes of differential operators describing compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems of PDE's. The related models can be both steady and evolutionary. Additional assumptions on the ellipticity of the differential complex provide a wide class of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic operators that could be generated in this way. In particular, it appears that an essentially large amount of equations related to the modern Mathematical Physics is generated by the de Rham complex of differentials on the exterior differential forms. These includes the elliptic Laplace and Lam\'e type operators; the parabolic heat transfer equation; the Euler type and Navier-Stokes type equations in Hydrodynamics; the hyperbolic wave equation and the Maxwell equations in Electrodynamics; the Klein-Gordon equation in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics; and so on. Our model generation method covers a broad class of generating systems, especially in higher spatial dimensions, due to different basic algebraic structures at play.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish an improved variable coefficient version of square function inequality, by which the local smoothing estimate $L^p_\alpha\rightarrow L^p$ for the Fourier integral operators satisfying cinematic curvature condition is further improved. In particular, we establish almost sharp results for $2&lt;p\leq 3$ and push forward the estimate for the critical point $p=4$. As a consequence, the local smoothing estimate for the wave equation on the manifold is refined. We generalize the results in \cite{LeVa12, Le18P} to its variable coefficient counterpart. The main ingredients in the argument includes multilinear oscillatory integral estimate \cite{BCT06} and decoupling inequality \cite{BelHicSog18P}.</description>

Abstract: We consider the scattering theory for the defocusing energy subcritical wave equations with an inverse square potential. By employing the energy flux method we establish energy flux estimates on the light cone. Then by the characteristic line method and radiation theorem, we show that the radial finite-energy solutions scatter to free waves outside of light cones. Using Morawetz estimates we then obtain the scattering theory for radial solutions with finite weighted energy initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exterior Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation. The prescribed asymptotic behavior at infinity of the solution is zero if $k&lt;\frac{n}{2}$, it is $\log|x|+O(1)$ if $k=\frac{n}{2}$ and it is $|x|^{\frac{2k-n}{n}}+O(1)$ if $k&gt;\frac{n}{2}$. By constructing smooth solutions of approximating non-degenerate $k$-Hessian equations with uniform $C^{1,1}$-estimates, we prove the existence part. The uniqueness follows from the comparison theorem and thus the $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the solution of the homogeneous $k$-Hessian equation in the exterior domain is proved. We also prove a uniform positive lower bound of the gradient. As an implication of the $C^{1,1}$ estimates, we derive an almost monotonicity formula along the level set of the approximating solution. In particular, we get an weighted geometric inequality which is a natural generalization of the $k=1$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the non-uniqueness of three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) system in $C([0,T];L^2(\mathbb{T}^3))$ for any initial data in $H^{\bar{\beta}}(\mathbb{T}^3)$~($\bar{\beta}&gt;0$), by exhibiting that the total energy and the cross helicity can be controlled in a given positive time interval. Our results extend the non-uniqueness results of the ideal MHD system to the viscous and resistive MHD system. Different from the ideal MHD system, the dissipative effect in the viscous and resistive MHD system prevents the nonlinear term from balancing the stress error $(\RR_q,\MM_q)$ as doing in \cite{2Beekie}. We introduce the box flows and construct the perturbation consisting in six different kinds of flows in convex integral scheme, which ensures that the iteration works and yields the non-uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new improved spectral projection estimates on manifolds of non-positive curvature, including sharp ones for relatively large spectral windows for general tori. Our results are stronger than those in an earlier work of the first and third authors [6], and the arguments have been greatly simplified. We more directly make use of pointwise estimates that are implicit in the work of Berard [2] and avoid the use of weak-type spaces that were used in the previous works [6] and [22]. We also simplify and strengthen the bilinear arguments by exploiting the use of microlocal $L^2\to L^{q_c}$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimates and avoiding the of $L^2\to L^2$ ones as in earlier results. This allows us to prove new results for manifolds of negative curvature and some new sharp estimates for tori. We also have new and improved techniques in two dimensions for general manifolds of non-positive curvature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of degenerate normalized $ p $-Laplacian equation with variable exponents for $ 1 &lt;p&lt;\infty$. We establish local $ C^{1,\alpha'} $ regularity of viscosity solutions by making use of the compactness argument, scaling techniques and the localized oscillating method. In addition, we also obtain almost optimal pointwise $ C^{1,\tau} $ regularity for a new model of the normalized $ p$-Laplacian equation involving non-homogeneous degenerate term $H(x,Du)$. The method in this paper is based on an improved oscillation-type estimate inspired by the ideas in Attouchi et al. (J. Math. Pures Appl, \textbf{108}: 553-591, 2017), which is different from the approach in the recent work by Jesus (Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, \textbf{61} (2022), Paper No. 29, 21 pp).</description>

Abstract: On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with Anosov geodesic flow, the problem of recovering a connection from the knowledge of traces of its holonomies along primitive closed geodesics is known as the holonomy inverse problem. In this paper, we prove H\"older type stability estimates for this inverse problem: 1) locally, near generic connections; 2) globally, for line bundles, and for vector bundles satisfying a certain low-rank assumption over negatively curved base $(M, g)$. The proofs are based on a combination of microlocal analysis along with a new non-Abelian approximate Livsic Theorem in hyperbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A blow-up result for a wave equation with critical Glassey derivative-type nonlinearity and not Dini continuous modulus of continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we consider a semilinear wave equation with derivative-type nonlinearity. More precisely, we consider a nonlinear term depending on the time derivative of the solution, which is the product of a power nonlinearity with critical Glassey exponent and a not Dini continuous modulus of continuity. By employing Zhou's approach along a certain characteristic line, we prove the blow-up in finite time for classical solutions (under suitable sign condition for the Cauchy data) and we derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan.</description>

      <title>Extension operators and Korn inequality for variable coefficients in perforated domains with applications to homogenization of viscoelastic non-simple materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the homogenization for nonlinear viscoelastic second-grade non-simple perforated materials at large strain in the quasistatic setting. The reference domain $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ is periodically perforated and is depending on the scaling parameter $\varepsilon$ which describes the ratio between the size of the whole domain and the small periodic perforations. The mechanical energy depends on the gradient and also the second gradient of the deformation, and also respects positivity of the determinant of the deformation gradient. For the viscous stresses we assume dynamic frame indifference and is therefore depending of the rate of the Cauchy-stress tensor. For the derivation of the homogenized model for $\varepsilon \to 0$ we use the method of two-scale convergence. For this uniform a priori estimates with respect to $\varepsilon$ are necessary. The most crucial part is to estimate the rate of the deformation gradient. Due to the time-dependent frame indifference of the viscous term, we only get coercivity with respect to the rate of the Cauchy-stress tensor. To overcome this problem we derive a Korn inequality for non-constant coefficients on the perforated domain. The crucial point is to verify that the constant in this inequality, which is usually depending on the domain, can be chosen independently of the parameter $\varepsilon$. Further, we construct an extension operator for second order Sobolev spaces on perforated domains with operator norm independent of $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of least energy solutions to the fractional Lane-Emden equation in the ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of least-energy solutions to the fractional Lane-Emden equation, under homogeneous Dirichlet exterior conditions, when the underlying domain is a ball $B \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. The equation is characterized by a superlinear, subcritical power-like nonlinearity. The proof makes use of Morse theory and is inspired by some results obtained by C. S. Lin in the '90s. A new Hopf's Lemma-type result shown in this paper is an essential element in the proof of nondegeneracy of least-energy solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present recent stability results with explicit and dimensionally sharp constants and optimal norms for the Sobolev inequality and for the Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality obtained by the authors in [24]. The stability for the Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality was obtained as a byproduct of the stability for the Sobolev inequality. Here we give a new, direct, alternative proof. We also discuss improved versions of interpolation inequalities based on the carr\'e du champ method.</description>

      <title>Radial symmetry and sharp asymptotic behaviors of nonnegative solutions to $D^{1,p}$-critical quasi-linear static Schr\"{o}dinger-Hartree equation involving $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_{p}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider nonnegative weak solution to the $D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$-critical quasi-linear static Schr\"{o}dinger-Hartree equation with $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_{p}$ and nonlocal nonlinearity: \begin{align*} -\Delta_p u =\left(|x|^{-2p}\ast |u|^{p}\right)|u|^{p-2}u \qquad &amp;\mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^N, \end{align*} where $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{N}{2}$, $N\geq3$ and $u\in D^{1,p}(\R^N)$. Being different to the $D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$-critical local nonlinear term $u^{p^{\star}-1}$ with $p^{\star}:=\frac{Np}{N-p}$ investigated in \cite{CFR,LDSMLMSB,GV,Ou,BS16,VJ16} etc., since the nonlocal convolution $|x|^{-2p}*u^p$ appears in the Hartree type nonlinearity, it is impossible for us to use the scaling arguments and the Doubling Lemma as in \cite{VJ16} to get preliminary estimates on upper bounds of asymptotic behaviors for any positive solutions $u$. Moreover, it is also quite difficult to obtain the boundedness of the quasi-norm $\|u \|_{L^{s,\infty}(\R^N)}$ and hence derive the sharp estimates on upper bounds of asymptotic behaviors from the preliminary estimates as in \cite{VJ16}. Fortunately, by showing a better preliminary estimates on upper bounds of asymptotic behaviors through the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash iteration method and combining the result from \cite{XCL}, we are able to overcome these difficulties and establish regularity and the sharp estimates on both upper and lower bounds of asymptotic behaviors for any positive solution $u$ to more general equation $-\Delta_p u=V(x)u^{p-1}$ with $V\in L^{\frac{N}{p}}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$. Then, by using the arguments from \cite{BS16,VJ16}, we can deduce the sharp estimates on both upper and lower bounds for the decay rate of $|\nabla u|$. Finally, as a consequence, we can apply the method of moving planes to prove that all the nontrivial nonnegative solutions are radially symmetric and strictly decreasing about some point $x_0\in\R^N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the null controllability of a one-dimensional fourth-order degenerate parabolic equation with a singular potential. Here, we analyze cases where boundary control conditions are applied at the left endpoint. We utilize a spectral decomposition involving Bessel functions and their zeros in a convenient weighted Sobolev space for a degenerate parabolic operator with specific boundary conditions. We establish the well-posedness of the system using semigroup operator theory. Subsequently, we employ the moment method by Fattorini and Russell to obtain an upper estimate of the cost of controllability. Additionally, we derive a lower estimate of the cost of controllability using a representation theorem for analytic functions of exponential type.</description>

      <title>Local behaviour of non-local hypoelliptic equations: divergence form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Strong Harnack inequality for a class of hypoelliptic integro-differential equations in divergence form. The proof is based on a priori estimates, and as such extends the first non-stochastic approach of the non-local parabolic Strong Harnack inequality by Kassmann-Weidner [arXiv:2303.05975] to hypoelliptic equations. In a first step, we derive a local bound on the non-local tail on upper level sets by exploiting the coercivity of the cross terms. In a second step, we perform a De Giorgi argument in $L^1$, since we control the tail term only in $L^1$. This yields a linear $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ bound. Consequentially, we prove polynomial upper and exponential lower bounds on the fundamental solution by adapting Aronson's method to non-local hypoelliptic equations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of capacities associated with local Muckenhoupt weights. Fundamental properties of local Muckenhoupt weights will be revisited. Weak type boundedness of nonlinear potential and capacitary strong type inequalities associated with such weights will be addressed. The boundedness of the local maximal function on the spaces of Choquet integrals associated with such weighted capacities will be justified as an application of the theory. We also address on the thinness of sets with the Kellogg property as another application.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of critical anisotropic Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all positive solutions of the critical anisotropic Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta^{H}_{p}u = u^{p^{*}-1}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} without the finite volume constraint for $n \geq 2$ and $\frac{(n+1)}{3} \leq p &lt; n$, where $p^{*} = \frac{np}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent and $-\Delta^{H}_{p}=-div(H^{p-1}(\cdot)\nabla H(\cdot))$ denotes the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator. This result removes the finite volume assumption on the classification of critical anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation which was obtained by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in the literature \cite{CFR}. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <title>Sharpness and non-sharpness of occupation measure bounds for integral variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze two recently proposed methods to establish a priori lower bounds on the minimum of general integral variational problems. The methods, which involve either `occupation measures' or a `pointwise dual relaxation' procedure, are shown to produce the same lower bound under a coercivity hypothesis ensuring their strong duality. We then show by a minimax argument that the methods actually evaluate the minimum for classes of one-dimensional, scalar-valued, or convex multidimensional problems. For generic problems, however, these methods should fail to capture the minimum and produce non-sharp lower bounds. We demonstrate this using two examples, the first of which is one-dimensional and scalar-valued with a non-convex constraint, and the second of which is multidimensional and non-convex in a different way. The latter example emphasizes the existence in multiple dimensions of nonlinear constraints on gradient fields that are ignored by occupation measures, but are built into the finer theory of gradient Young measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a population organised hierarchically with respect to size in such a way that the growth rate of each individual depends only on the presence of larger individuals. As a concrete example one might think of a forest, in which the incidence of light on a tree (and hence how fast it grows) is affected by shading of taller trees. The model is formulated as a delay equation, more specifically a scalar renewal equation, for the population birth rate. After discussing the well-posedness of the model, we analyse how many stationary birth rates the equation can have in terms of the functional parameters of the model. In particular we show that, under reasonable and rather general assumptions, only one stationary birth rate can exist besides the trivial one (associated to the state in which there are no individuals and the population birth rate is zero). We give conditions for this non-trivial stationary birth rate to exist and we analyse its stability using the principle of linearised stability for delay equations. Finally we relate the results to an alternative formulation of the model taking the form of a quasilinear partial differential equation for the population size-density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a measurable function $g:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to\mathbb{R}$, with $d\geq 3$, satisfies the functional relation \begin{equation*} g(\omega)+g(\omega_*)=g(\omega')+g(\omega_*'), \end{equation*} for all admissible $\omega,\omega_*,\omega',\omega_*'\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in the sense that \begin{equation*} \omega+\omega_*=\omega'+\omega_*', \end{equation*} if and only if it can be written as \begin{equation*} g(\omega)=A+B\cdot\omega, \end{equation*} for some constants $A\in \mathbb{R}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Such functions form a family of quantized collision invariants which play a fundamental role in the study of hydrodynamic regimes of the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation near Fermionic condensates, i.e., at low temperatures. In particular, they characterize the elastic collisional dynamics of Fermions near a statistical equilibrium where quantum effects are predominant.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define a model of non-interacting quantum fields satisfying $(\Delta_g-\lambda^2)\phi=0$ on a Riemannian scattering space $(M,g)$ with two boundary components, i.e. a manifold with two asymptotically conic ends (meaning asymptotic to the "large end" of a cone). Our main result describes a canonical construction of two-point functions satisfying a version of the Hadamard condition.</description>
