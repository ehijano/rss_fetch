      <title>Direct numerical simulations of the supersonic Taylor--Green vortex via the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the three-dimensional compressible Taylor--Green vortex from the perspective of kinetic theory by directly solving the six-dimensional Boltzmann equation. This work studies the connections between molecular-scale information encoded in the high-dimensional distribution function (e.g., molecular entropy measures) and macroscopic turbulent flow characteristics. We present high-order direct numerical simulations at Mach numbers of $0.5$ to $1.25$ and Reynolds numbers of $400$ to $1600$ performed using up to $137{\times}10^{9}$ degrees of freedom. The results indicate that the Kullback--Leibler divergence of the distribution function $f$ and its local equilibrium state $M[f]$ (i.e., the relative entropy functional $\langle f \log (f/M[f]) \rangle$) is strongly related to the macroscopic viscous dissipation rate, with the relative entropy value matching the sum of the solenoidal and dilatational dissipation rates very closely across a range of Mach and Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we present the behavior of subgrid-scale quantities under spatial averaging/filtering operations performed directly on the particle distribution function, which shows notable similarities between the subgrid-scale dissipation and subgrid-scale relative entropy. These observations imply that information encoded in the distribution function, particularly certain measures of its deviation from equilibrium, may be useful for closure-modeling for compressible turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Study of Non-linear Flows and Shear Banding in Wormlike Micelles Under Varying Elasticity, Flow Curvature, and Surfactant Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the flow dynamics of two shear-banding wormlike micellar solutions with distinct surfactant chemistries in a Taylor-Couette (TC) setup following a startup shear. The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal, exhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By varying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a range of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under a step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced stress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow curvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond a critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal solution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution, despite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal under any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from the stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their larger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions. Additionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced by elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at low values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate values, and diminishes at high values. Our findings highlight how surfactant chemistry, elasticity number, and flow curvature control shear-banding flows in wormlike micelles.</description>

      <title>The interscale behaviour of uncertainty in three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the scale-by-scale uncertainty energy budget equation and demonstrate theoretically and computationally the presence of a self-similar equilibrium cascade of decorrelation in an inertial range of scales during the time range of power law growth of uncertainty in statistically stationary homogeneous turbulence. This cascade is predominantly inverse and driven by compressions of the reference field's relative deformation tensor and their aligments with the uncertainty velocity field. Three other subdominant cascade mechanisms are also present, two of which are forward and also dominated by compressions and one of which, the weakest and the only non-linear one of the four, is inverse. The uncertainty production and dissipation scalings which may follow from the self-similar equilibrium cascade of decorrelation lead to power law growths of the uncertainty integral scale and the average uncertainty energy which are also investigated. Compressions are not only key to chaoticity, as previously shown, but also to stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional and clap-and-fling effects on a pair of flapping wings used for thrust generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the three-dimensional effects of flow around a pair of flapping wings undergoing clap-and-fling interactions through harmonic in-plane motions combining pitching, heaving, and deviation. Both wings mirror each other in their movements. Baseline parameters were selected based on efficient configurations from a previous two-dimensional study. Simulations at a Reynolds number of 800 were conducted on wings in a thrust configuration utilizing the clap-and-fling mechanism. Rectangular flat-plate wings with various aspect ratios were evaluated to assess the impact of three-dimensional effects on performance. Results were compared with equivalent two-dimensional computations. It was found that the relative decrease in cycle-averaged efficiency due to three-dimensional effects can be limited to approximately 5.59% by using wings with an aspect ratio of 8, the largest considered in this work. Moreover, wing proximity inherent to clap-and-fling kinematics helps mitigate adverse three-dimensional effects.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</description>

      <title>The semi-analytic theory and computation of finite-depth standing water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Stokes expansion ansatz for finite-depth standing water waves in two dimensions and devise a recursive algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. We implement the algorithm on a supercomputer using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Stokes expansion introduces hyperbolic terms that require exponentiation of power series, which we handle efficiently using Bell polynomials. Although exact resonances occur at a countable dense set of fluid depths, we prove that for almost every depth, the divisors that arise in the recurrence are bounded away from zero by a slowly decaying function of the wave number. A direct connection between small divisors and imperfect bifurcations is observed. They are found to activate secondary standing waves that oscillate non-uniformly in space and time on top of the primary wave, with different amplitudes and phases on each bifurcation branch. We compute new families of standing waves using a shooting method and find that Pad\'e approximants of the Stokes expansion continue to converge to the shooting method solutions at large amplitudes as new small divisors enter the recurrence. Closely spaced poles and zeros of the Pad\'e approximants are observed, which suggests that the bifurcation branches are separated by branch cuts.</description>

      <title>Symmetric instability in a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at mid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise convection on gas giants and icy moon oceans. Here, we apply linear instability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a rotating spherical planet, with applicability to icy moon oceans. We divide the instabilities into three types: (1) gravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along angular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular momentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed symmetric instability, occurring when neither of the previous conditions are fulfilled, but the potential vorticity has the opposite sign to planetary rotation. We note that $N^2&lt;0$ where $N$ is the Brunt--V\"ais\"al\"a frequency -- a typical criterion used to trigger convective adjustment in global ocean models -- is neither necessary nor sufficient for instability. Instead, $b_z \sin{\theta_0}&lt;0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation axis and $\theta_0$ is the local latitude, is always sufficient for instability and also necessary in the low Rossby number limit. In this limit, relevant for deep convection in icy moon oceans, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the planetary rotation axis. This slantwise convection differs from the parameterized convection in existing general circulation models, whose convection schemes parameterize convection in the direction of gravity. Our results suggest that convection schemes in global ocean models must be revised before being applied to icy moon oceans.</description>

      <title>Droplet spreading in a wedge: A route to fluid rheology for power-law liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the rheology of liquids typically requires precise control over shear rates and stresses. Here, we describe an alternative route for predicting the characteristic features of a power-law fluid by simply observing the capillary spreading dynamics of viscous droplets in a wedge-shaped geometry. In this confined setting, capillary and viscous forces interact to produce a spreading dynamics described by anomalous diffusion, a process where the front position grows as a power-law in time with an exponent that differs from the value $1/2$ found in classical diffusion. We derive a nonlinear diffusion equation that captures this behavior, and we show that the diffusion exponent is directly related to the rheological exponent of the fluid. We verify this relationship by using both experiments and simulations for different power-law fluids. As the predictions are independent from flow-specific details, this approach provides a robust tool for inferring rheological properties from the spreading dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows for which the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is strongly non-normal. The responses of such flows to external perturbations are spanned by a generically very large number of non-orthogonal eigenmodes. They are therefore qualified as ``nonmodal" responses, to insist on the inefficiency of the eigenbasis to describe them. In the aim of the article to reduce the system to a lower-dimensional one free of spatial degrees of freedom, (eigen)modal reduction techniques, such as the center manifold, are thus inappropriate precisely because the leading-order dynamics cannot be restricted to a low-dimensional eigensubspace. On the other hand, it is often true that only a small number (we assume only one) of singular modes is sufficient to reconstruct the nonmodal responses at the leading order. By adopting the latter paradigm, we propose a general method to analytically derive a weakly nonlinear amplitude equation for the nonmodal response of a fluid flow to a small harmonic forcing, stochastic forcing, and initial perturbation, respectively. In these last two problems, we assumed a parallel base flow with a spatially monochromatic external excitation. The present approach is simpler than the one we previously proposed and provides an explicit treatment of the sub-optimal responses. The derived amplitude equations are tested in three distinct flows. For sufficiently small excitation amplitudes, yet up to values large enough for the flow to depart from the linear regime, they can systematically predict the weakly nonlinear modification of the gains as the amplitude of the external excitation is increased. However, the proposed approach condemns the flow spatial structure to be mostly along the leading singular mode, and thus is often too simplistic to predict the occurrence of subcritical transitions as the excitation amplitude is increased to too large values.</description>
