      <title>A Space-Time Multigrid Method for Space-Time Finite Element Discretizations of Parabolic and Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a space-time multigrid method based on tensor-product space-time finite element discretizations. The method is facilitated by the matrix-free capabilities of the {\ttfamily deal.II} library. It addresses both high-order continuous and discontinuous variational time discretizations with spatial finite element discretizations. The effectiveness of multigrid methods in large-scale stationary problems is well established. However, their application in the space-time context poses significant challenges, mainly due to the construction of suitable smoothers. To address these challenges, we develop a space-time cell-wise additive Schwarz smoother and demonstrate its effectiveness on the heat and acoustic wave equations. The matrix-free framework of the {\ttfamily deal.II} library supports various multigrid strategies, including $h$-, $p$-, and $hp$-refinement across spatial and temporal dimensions. Extensive empirical evidence, provided through scaling and convergence tests on high-performance computing platforms, demonstrate high performance on perturbed meshes and problems with heterogeneous and discontinuous coefficients. Throughputs of over a billion degrees of freedom per second are achieved on problems with more than a trillion global degrees of freedom. The results prove that the space-time multigrid method can effectively solve complex problems in high-fidelity simulations and show great potential for use in coupled problems.</description>

      <title>Modelling parametric uncertainty in PDEs models via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an approach enabling one to employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for uncertainty quantification. Our approach is applicable to systems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical situations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed neural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain across which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a unique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We employ a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate high-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU in a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing its reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU emerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte Carlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn \emph{a priori} unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>SPACIER: On-Demand Polymer Design with Fully Automated All-Atom Classical Molecular Dynamics Integrated into Machine Learning Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has rapidly advanced the design and discovery of new materials with targeted applications in various systems. First-principles calculations and other computer experiments have been integrated into material design pipelines to address the lack of experimental data and the limitations of interpolative machine learning predictors. However, the enormous computational costs and technical challenges of automating computer experiments for polymeric materials have limited the availability of open-source automated polymer design systems that integrate molecular simulations and machine learning. We developed SPACIER, an open-source software program that integrates RadonPy, a Python library for fully automated polymer property calculations based on all-atom classical molecular dynamics into a Bayesian optimization-based polymer design system to overcome these challenges. As a proof-of-concept study, we successfully synthesized optical polymers that surpass the Pareto boundary formed by the tradeoff between the refractive index and Abbe number.</description>

      <title>A Portable Parton-Level Event Generator for the High-Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06198v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of computing hardware different from the traditional CPU+RAM model in data centers around the world mandates a change in the design of event generators for the Large Hadron Collider, in order to provide economically and ecologically sustainable simulations for the high-luminosity era of the LHC. Parton-level event generation is one of the most computationally demanding parts of the simulation and is therefore a prime target for improvements. We present a production-ready leading-order parton-level event generation framework capable of utilizing most modern hardware and discuss its performance in the standard candle processes of vector boson and top-quark pair production with up to five additional jets.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for understanding the dynamical properties of condensed matter, molecular systems in quantum chemistry, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>
