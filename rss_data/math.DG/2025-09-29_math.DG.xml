      <title>Non-collapsed eGH convergence and dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_i,p_i)$ be a non-collapsing sequence of pointed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound, and $G_i \leq \text{Iso} (X_i)$ a sequence of closed subgroups of isometries. We show that if the triples $(X_i, G_i, p_i)$ converge in the equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff sense to a triple $(X,G,p)$, then $\text{dim} (G) \geq \limsup _{i \to \infty} \text{dim} (G_i)$, generalizing a result of Harvey to the non-compact setting. The argument also applies in the non-smooth setting of RCD spaces. As an application, we investigate RCD spaces with large isometry groups, extending results of Galaz-Garc\'ia--Kell--Mondino--Sosa and Galaz-Garc\'ia--Guijarro.</description>

      <title>Deficit functions and the log Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long history of parabolic monotonicity formulas that developed independently from several different fields and a much more recent elliptic theory. The elliptic theory can be localized and there are additional monotone quantities. There is also a surprising link: Taking a high-dimensional limit of the right elliptic monotonicity can give a parabolic one as a limit. Poincar\'e was the first to observe such a connection. We introduce two deficit functions, one elliptic and one parabolic, then show that the parabolic deficit is pointwise the limit of the elliptic and, that the elliptic satisfies an equation that converges to the equation for the parabolic. These pointwise quantities and their equations recover the monotonicities and leads to an elliptic proof of the log Sobolev inequality as well as new concentration of measure phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison and splitting theorems for the infinity-Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the diameter comparison, the global weighted volume comparison and the splitting theorem in weighted manifolds when the infinity-Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature has a lower bound in the spectrum sense. Our results extend Antonelli-Xu's spectral Bonnet-Myers and Bishop-Gromov theorems, and Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu's spectral splitting theorem to weighted manifolds. Our results are also some supplements of Chu-Hao's spectral diameter and global volume comparisons, and Yeung's spectral splitting theorem in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>An analytic proof of Griffiths' conjecture on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Griffiths' conjecture asserts that a holomorphic vector bundle is ample if and only if it admits a Hermitian metric with positive curvature. In this paper, we present a new proof of this conjecture on compact Riemann surfaces using a system of PDEs introduced by Demailly. Our argument combines techniques developed by Uhlenbeck-Yau for Hermitian-Einstein metrics with Pingali's reduction of the problem to an a priori estimate.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization of a hessian KV- structure on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the quantization of the deformation of Hessian structures on a two-dimensional vector space, in the framework of Koszul-Vinberg algebras. We analyze how Hessian structures can be deformed to obtain quantum structures while preserving certain geometric and algebraic properties. The aim of the paper is to establish links between deformation theory and Hessian geometry.</description>

Abstract: We show that the sectional curvature of a Riemannian manifold is nonnegative if, and only if, the entropy functional is matrix displacement convex. As an application we obtain intrinsic dimensional evolution variational inequalities, and the corresponding Wasserstein contraction along heat flows, which improve on their dimensional counterparts.</description>

      <title>Legendrian curve flow in Sasakian sub-Riemannian 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a kind of inverse mean curvature flow (1.2) in a Sasakian sub-Riemannian 3-manifold $M$ for Legendrian curves, which slightly differs from the classical one, and confirm that this flow preserves the Legendrian condition and increases the length of curves. We establish the long-time existence of the flow (1.2) when the Webster scalar curvature $W$ of $M$ satisfies $ W \in (-\infty, \bar{W}_{0} )\cup \{ 0\} \cup (W_{0}, +\infty)$, where $\bar{W}_{0} &lt;0$ and $W_{0} &gt;0$ are constants. Moreover, we derive that the local limit curve (the asymptotic behavior) along the flow (1.2) is a geodesic of vanishing curvature when $W \geq 0$, wherea it is a geodesic of nonvanishing curvature when $W$ is a negative constant.
  Specially, in the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{M}(0)$, we further construct a length-preserving flow (1.3) via a dilation of the flow (1.2) and show that closed Legendrian curves converge to Euclidean helices with vertical axis. By exploiting the properties of the flow (1.3), we establish a Minkowski-type formula for Legendrian curves in $\mathbb{M}(0)$ and provide a new proof of the fact that the total curvature of $\gamma \subset \mathbb{M}(0)$ with strictly positive curvature equals $2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Existence of Positive Scalar Curvature and Positive Yamabe constant on Hypersurfaces of Noncompact Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ X $ be an oriented, closed manifold with $ \dim X \geqslant 2 $. Let $ (Z, \partial Z) $ be an oriented, compact manifold with (possibly empty) smooth boundary and $ \dim Z \geqslant 2 $. In this article, we show that if the noncompact cylinder $ X \times \mathbb{R} $ admits a complete Riemannian metric $ g $ with positive injectivity radius and uniformly positive scalar curvature, and that is of bounded geometry or bounded curvature, then $ X $ admits a positive scalar curvature metric within the same conformal class provided that some $ g $-angle condition is satisfied. This partially answers a conjecture of Rosenberg and Stolz \cite{RosSto} without topological assumptions. With the $ g $-angle condition, we can also show that if $ (Z \times \mathbb{R}, \partial Z \times \mathbb{R}) $ admits a complete metric $ g $ that has positive Yamabe constant and positive injectivity radius, and is of bounded geometry or bounded curvature, then $ (Z, \partial Z) $ has positive Yamabe constant for the conformal class $ [\imath^{*}g] $ with the natural inclusion $ \imath : (Z, \partial Z) \hookrightarrow (Z \times \mathbb{R}, \partial Z \times \mathbb{R}) $.</description>

Abstract: In this study, inextensible flows of curves in four-dimensional pseudo-Galilean space are expressed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions of these curve flows are given as partial differential equations. Also, the directional derivatives are defined in accordance with the Serret-Frenet frame in G41, the extended Serret-Frenet relations are expressed by using Frenet formulas in G41. Furthermore, the bending elastic energy functions are expressed for the same particle according to curve a(s,t).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate and characterise an arbitrary admissible curve in terms of its curvature functions in the pseudo-Galilean space $G_{1}^{4}$% . We also give some special curves in four-dimensional pseudo-Galilean space and their characterisations, such as position curve, osculating curve, normal curve, rectifying curve, slant helices, and spherical curves. Moreover, this study provides classifications of admissible curves in $G_{1}^{4}$. That is, the admissible rectifying curves lying fully in the $G_{1}^{4}$ are expressed and given necessary and sufficient conditions for such a curve to be an admissible rectifying curve, osculating curve, normal curve, slant helices and spherical curves in $G_{1}^{4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J. C. C. Nitsche proved that any minimal disk satisfying the free boundary condition in the unit ball B3 must be an equatorial flat disk. In this short note, we extend Nitsche's result to Y-singular minimal surfaces that satisfy the free boundary condition in B3. Specifically, we show that any conformal and minimal immersion of the standard compact flat Y-cone that meets B3 orthogonally must itself be a flat Y-cone. Furthermore, we compute the Morse index of the free boundary flat Y-cone, showing that it is two, and we prove that Y-cones are the only free boundary minimal surfaces of index two in B3.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Quasi-Einstein Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modified Ricci solitons as a new class of Einstein type metrics that contains both Ricci solitons and n-quasi-Einstein metrics. This class is closely related to the construction of the Ricci solitons that are realised as warped products. A modified Ricci soliton appears as part of a special solution of the modified Ricci-harmonic flow, which result a new char- acterization of n-quasi-Einstein metrics. We also study the modified Ricci almost solitons. In the spirit of the Lichnerowicz and Obata first eigenvalue theorems, we prove that in the class of compact Riemannian manifolds with constant scalar curvature the standard sphere with a structure of gradient modified Ricci almost soliton is rigid under some specific geometric conditions. Moreover, we display an example of modified Ricci-harmonic soliton.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Derivations Of K-Theoretic Donaldson Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\times S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices, which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and $X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$ ``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)&gt;0$ we can derive the partition function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization with respect to the $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)&gt;1$. Our results agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima, Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds. When the circumference of the circle is tuned to special values, the path integral is associated with the 5d superconformal $E_1$ theory. Topological invariants in this case involve generalizations of Seiberg-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay Between Hodge Projections and Bounded Harmonic Functions on Manifolds with Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $L^p$-boundedness of the Hodge projection in the setting of manifolds with ends. We examine its relationship to the Riesz transform and the space of bounded harmonic functions. In particular, we explore how the $L^p$-boundedness of the Hodge projection is connected to the structure of $L^2$ harmonic one-forms and, subsequently, to the space of bounded harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic contact symplectic lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $M$ endowed with a holomorphic contact structure $V$, one can define a sub-Finsler pseudometric through holomorphic discs tangent to $V$. If the integrated pseudodistance is a distance, then $M$ is $V$-hyperbolic, a generalisation of Kobayashi hyperbolicity.
  In this paper, we focus on Reeb manifolds $M$, which are contact manifolds with a free holomorphic $\mathbb{C}$-action generated by a Reeb vector field. We show that every proper Reeb manifold is the total space of a {\sl contact symplectic lift}, that is, it admits a $\mathbb C$-principal bundle structure onto a complex manifold $S$ endowed with a $C^\infty$-exact holomorphic symplectic form $\omega$ so that the pull back of $\omega$ is related to the contact structure $V$ of $M$. Conversely, we prove that any $C^\infty$-exact holomorphic symplectic manifold is given as the base of a contact symplectic lift.
  We also prove that $M$ is (complete) $V$-hyperbolic if and only if $S$ is (complete) Kobayashi hyperbolic. This yields many new examples of $V$-hyperbolic manifolds.
  Finally, we study the automorphism group ${\sf Aut}_V M$ of those automorphisms of $M$ preserving $V$. In case $M$ is $V$-hyperbolic, this is a finite-dimensional Lie group, and we provide a classification in dimension $3$, where $2 \leq \dim_{\mathbb{R}} {\sf Aut}_V M \leq 7$, with the extremal upper case realised uniquely (up to natural equivalences) by the contact symplectic lift of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^2$ endowed with the symplectic form $\frac{2}{(1-z)^3} dz \wedge dw$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, using two constant tensors $c$ and $b$ on $sl(N)\otimes sl(N)$ satisfying certain linear-quadratic equation and a technique of Poisson bivectors and Schouten brackets, we explicitly construct quadratic Poisson bracket on the space $ (sl(N)+\mathbb{C})^*$ which is compatible with the standard Lie--Poisson bracket on $gl(N)^* \simeq (sl(N)\oplus \mathbb{C})^*$. The case of $N=3$ is considered in details. The relation of the proposed brackets with the generalized classical Sklyanin algebras is explained.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the structure of the future causal completion $\hat{M}$ of a globally hyperbolic GRW spacetime $\mathbb{R}\times_\alpha M$ using the novel notion of Lorentzian pre-length spaces.

Abstract: System identification of autoregressive processes on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds are presented and studied. We define the system parameters as elements in the orthogonal group and we show that the system can be estimated by averaging over observations. Then we propose an algorithm on how to compute these system parameters using conjugate gradient descent on Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds, respectively.</description>

      <title>The failure of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture in the impulsive case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1962, Ehlers and Kundt conjectured that plane waves are the only class of complete Ricci-flat~\emph{pp}-waves, i.e.\ metrics on ${\mathbb R}^4$ of the form \[ ds^2=2du\,dv+dx^2+dy^2+H(x,y,u)du^2\,. \] Recently, Flores and S\'{a}nchez gave a proof of the conjecture in the fundamental case of spatially polynomially bounded profile functions $H$. However, impulsive pp-waves, i.e., waves with concentrated profile functions of the form $H(x,y,u)=f(x,y)\,\delta(u)$ ($\delta$, the Dirac measure) have been found to be complete. We summarise completeness results for several classes of impulsive wave spacetimes achieved during the last years and discuss them in the context of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Translators can be regarded as submanifolds which satisfy the mean curvature flow equation when evolving by translations along a distinguished vector field of the ambient space. We study translators in Generalised Robertson-Walker spacetimes, due to their importance as Lorentzian manifolds, and because they admit a natural conformal Killing timelike vector field carrying substantial geometric information, which will play the role of this translating vector field. We identify three one-parameter families of warping functions for which these objects exist. As a first example of this notion of translator, we classify the analogues of the classical Grim Reapers within this context.</description>

      <title>A New Monotone Quantity in Mean Curvature Flow Implying Sharp Homotopic Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new monotone quantity in graphical mean curvature flows of higher codimensions is identified in this work. The submanifold deformed by the mean curvature flow is the graph of a map between Riemannian manifolds, and the quantity is monotone increasing under the area-decreasing condition of the map. The flow provides a natural homotopy of the corresponding map and leads to sharp criteria regarding the homotopic class of maps between complex projective spaces, and maps from spheres to complex projective spaces, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenfamilies of Gudmundsson and Sakovich can be used to generate harmonic morphisms, proper $r$-harmonic maps, and minimal co-dimension $2$ submanifolds. This article begins by characterising the globally defined eigenfamilies of the sphere $S^m$; they correspond to orthogonal families of homogeneous polynomial harmonic morphisms from $\Bbb{R}^{m+1}$ to $\Bbb C$, all of the same degree. We investigate and construct such families, paying special attention to those that are not congruent to families of holomorphic polynomials. Strong restrictions for families of such polynomials are found in low dimensions, and the pairs of degree $2$ maps that induce an eigenfamily are classified.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a potential theory for the Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) equation in the space of K\"ahler potentials which is parallel to the potential theory for the Hermitian--Yang--Mills equation. A concept called $\omega$-harmonicity on graphs is introduced which characterizes the WZW equation. We also show that, with respect to a Banach--Mazur type distance function, the distance between two solutions of the WZW equation is subharmonic.
  The harmonic map into the space of K\"ahler potentials, as a special case of the WZW equation, is also investigated. In particular, we show the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the harmonic map, and the approximation/quantization by its finite dimensional counterparts.</description>

      <title>A spectral volume comparison for manifolds with weakly convex boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the Bonnet-Myers theorem and the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem in the spectral sense for manifolds with weakly convex boundary. For $n\geq 3$, let $(M^n,g)$ be a simply connected compact smooth $n$-manifold with weakly convex boundary $\partial M$. If there exists a positive function $w\in C^{\infty}(M)$ that satisfies: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta w+\Lambda_{\Ric} w\geq (n-1)w, \enspace in \enspace M,
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial \eta}=0, \enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace \enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace\enspace \enspace\enspace \enspace\enspace on \enspace\partial M,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Lambda_{\Ric}$ denotes the smallest eigenvalue of the Ricci tensor, $\eta$ is the unit co-normal vector field of $\partial M$ in $M$, then the diameter of $M$ satisfies $\diam(M)\leq (\frac{\max w}{\min w})^{\frac{n-3}{n-1}}\pi$.\par If, in addition, $w$ attains its minimum on the boundary $\partial M$, we obtain a sharp upper bound for the volume of $M$: $\Vol(M)\leq \Vol(\bS^n_{+})$, with equality holding if and only if $M^n$ is isometric to the unit round hemisphere $\bS^{n}_{+}$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study strict convexity on simply connected Riemannian manifolds without focal points, a class of manifolds which contains not only Hadamard manifolds but also examples of manifolds whose sectional curvatures change sign. Using the geometrically defined convex functions on such manifolds, namely the distance function and the Busemann function, strictly convex functions with various desired additional properties are constructed. From the former, we derive interesting consequences such as the continuity of the isoperimetric profile function without conditions on the sectional curvature and, if the manifolds are also K\"ahler, Steinness as well as a lower bound on the volume growth of metric balls. Our primary applications concern the spectrum of the Laplacian. We prove that the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum contains a certain infinite interval assuming only the existence of a point with respect to which the radial curvatures are nonpositive. This is a substantial generalisation of the corresponding result for Hadamard manifolds. In the latter case of Busemann functions, we use the geometry at infinity to give a new construction of a strictly convex function assuming that the Ricci curvature is negative. We then apply this to show that the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous on a class of manifolds for which all the horospheres have the same constant mean curvature. In particular, for a well-studied subclass for which the condition on Ricci curvature is automatically satisfied, we completely determine the spectrum. This construction also enables us to recover the classical result on the spectrum in the case of symmetric spaces of noncompact type and higher rank even though the mean curvatures of horospheres there are not constant.</description>

      <title>Two classification results for stationary surfaces of the least moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surface in Euclidean space $\r^3$ is said to be an $\alpha$-stationary surface if it is a critical point of the energy $\int_\Sigma|p|^\alpha$, where $\alpha\in\r$. We prove that all ruled $\alpha$-stationary surfaces are vector planes (for all $\alpha$) and a type of elongated helicoids (for $\alpha=1$). The second result of classification asserts that if $\alpha\not=-2,-4$, any $\alpha$-stationary surface foliated by circles must be a rotational surface. If $\alpha=-4$, the surface is the inversion of a plane, a helicoid, a catenoid or an Riemann minimal example. If $\alpha=-2$, we find many non-spherical cyclic $(-2)$-stationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>On Nilpotent and Solvable Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate nilpotent and unimodular solvable Lie groups that admit quasi-Einstein metrics $(M,g,X)$ with $X$ a left-invariant vector field, which we call totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metrics. We give a complete classification of nilpotent Lie groups admitting such metrics, proving that this occurs if and only if the group is Heisenberg. For unimodular solvable Lie groups $S$, we show that the existence of a non-flat totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric forces the center of $S$ to be one-dimensional. Furthermore, under the additional assumption that the adjoint action $\operatorname{ad}_a$ of $S$ is a normal derivation, we obtain a full classification: these groups are standard and their nilradical must be Heisenberg Lie algebra. As an application, we prove that the only near-horizon geometries on a nilmanifold are $\Gamma \backslash H_{n}$, where $ H_{n}$ is $n$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie group.</description>

      <title>Systolic Inequality and Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between systolic geometry and positive scalar curvature through spinorial methods. Our main theorem establishes an upper bound for the two-dimensional stable systole on certain high-dimensional manifolds with positive scalar curvature under a suitable stretch-scale condition. The proof combines techniques from geometric measure theory, reminiscent of Gromov's systolic inequality, with curvature estimates derived from the Gromov-Lawson relative index theorem. This approach provides a new framework for studying the relationship between positive scalar curvature metrics and systolic geometry in higher-dimensional manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the conjectured capillary Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality holds for any unconditional, strictly convex capillary hypersurface when $\theta \in \left(0, \tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$. Moreover, for $\theta \in \left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}, \pi\right)$, we show that the capillary volume product has no finite upper bound.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <title>On Sun-Zhang's theory of Fano fibrations -- weighted volumes, moduli and bubbling Fano fibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of Fano fibration with asymptotically conical base from degenerating Fano fibration.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a uniformly convex norm $ \phi $ on $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ and a unit-density $ n $-dimensional varifold $ V $ in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature, under the hypothesis
  $$ \textrm{$\mathcal{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is absolutely continuous with respect to $ \| V \| $},$$
  we prove that there exists an open dense $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part in $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $. Moreover we prove that the $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part of $ V $ is $ \mathcal{H}^n $-almost equal to $({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast $, the subset of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ where at least one blow up (in Hausdorff distance) of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is not equal to $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $.
  These results are consequences of a quadratic flatness theorem asserting that if $ V $ is a general -- not necessarily rectifiable -- varifold $ V $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature and locally $ \mathcal{H}^n $-finite support, then the set of points $ R $ where $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ admits (exactly) two mutually tangent balls satisfies $ \mathcal{H}^n(({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast \setminus R) =0 $ and meets each relatively open set of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ on a set of positive $ \mathcal{H}^n $-measure. Indeed, quadratic flatness at a point guarantees that the Allard anisotropic regularity theorem can be applied, hence proving that $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ is regular around that point.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of critical points of hydrophobic capillary functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity, among sets of finite perimeter, of volume-preserving critical points of the capillary energy in the half space, in the case where the prescribed interior contact angle is between $90^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. No structural or regularity assumption is required on the finite perimeter sets. Assuming that the ``tangential'' part of the capillary boundary is $\mathcal{H}^n$-null, this rigidity theorem extends to the full hydrophobic regime of interior contact angles between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Furthermore, we establish the anisotropic counterpart of this theorem under the assumption of lower density bounds.</description>
