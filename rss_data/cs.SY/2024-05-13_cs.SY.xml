      <title>PowerLine Unmanned Surfer (PLUS): Shape Adaptive Dynamics Development and Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the powerline unmanned surfer (PLUS) concept to extend the limited endurance of fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) via in-flight energy harvesting from overhead electrical distribution power lines, and develops the flight dynamics and control framework to support centimeter-scale longitudinal powerline frequency tracking. The dynamics framework models the UAV's shape adaptive structure, aerodynamic forces, and control inputs, and applies the coupled flight mechanics framework to low clearance tracking of powerline contours. This study develops a "trajectory to shape-adaptive UAV" controller design approach for longitudinal powerline tracking through local spatial frequency matching. The frequency-matching approach dynamically regulates the aircraft modes' frequency to the powerline catenary spatial frequency using a generalized parameter linearization approach. Performance is assessed on an example UAV implementing camber and thickness morphing by quantifying clearance distance from neighborhood to high voltage powerline environments and across span and chord combinations. This approach achieves alternating periods of low-clearance tracking and antiphase oscillation, with 34% of the powerline having tracking error less than 1m. Airfoil thickness increase has a stronger effect over Phugoid mode wavelength than thickness decrease. Wingspan, chord, and powerline parameter sensitivities are quantified, providing a foundation for near-field long-distance powerline tracking and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of current limiters and fast voltage boosters in grid-forming VSC-based generators on transient stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient stability is a complex phenomenon presented in multi-machine and multi-converter systems, and it is still considered a key limiting factor for stressed power systems. The increasing integration of non-synchronous generation further emphasises the need to address the challenges of improving the transient stability faced by these power systems. Several studies have focused on developing control strategies for GFM-VSCs to improve transient stability. These strategies include the use of current limiting algorithms and/or control of active/reactive power injections. This paper investigates the impact of fast voltage boosters (FVBs) and hybrid current limiters (HCLs) on transient stability of power systems with 100% grid-forming VSC-based generators. Short-circuit simulations and critical clearing time analysis are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of HCLs and FVBs in improving transient stability. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in avoiding the loss of synchronism. This research contributes to the current studies on transient stability in power systems and provides valuable insights into the potential of HCLs and FVBs as effective approaches to improve system stability.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Route Guidance and Flow Control for Mixed Road Networks Comprising Expressway and Arterial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facing the congestion challenges of mixed road networks comprising expressways and arterial road networks, traditional control solutions fall short. To effectively alleviate traffic congestion in mixed road networks, it is crucial to clear the interaction between expressways and arterial networks and achieve orderly coordination between them. This study employs the multi-class cell transmission model (CTM) combined with the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to model the traffic dynamics of expressway systems and arterial subregions, enabling vehicle path tracking across these two systems. Consequently, a comprehensive traffic transmission model suitable for mixed road networks has been integrated. Utilizing the SUMO software, a simulation platform for the mixed road network is established, and the average trip lengths within the model have been calibrated. Based on the proposed traffic model, this study constructs a route guidance model for mixed road networks and develops an integrated model predictive control (MPC) strategy that merges route guidance, perimeter control, and ramp metering to address the challenges of mixed road networks' traffic flow control. A case study of a scenario in which a bidirectional expressway connects two subregions is conducted, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance and control (CGC) method in reducing overall congestion in mixed road networks.</description>

      <title>Resilient control of networked switched systems subject to deception attack and DoS attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the resilient control for switched systems in the presence of deception attack and denial-of-service (DoS) attack is addressed. Due to the interaction of two kinds of attacks and the asynchronous phenomenon of controller mode and subsystem mode, the system dynamics becomes much more complex. A criterion is derived to ensure the mean square security level of the closed-loop system. This in turn reveals the balance of system resilience and control performance. Furthermore, a mixed-switching control strategy is put forward to make the system globally asymptotically stable. It is shown that the system will still converge to the equilibrium even if the deception attack occurs. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Joint Uplink and Downlink Rate Splitting for Fog Computing-Enabled Internet of Medical Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) facilitates in-home electronic healthcare, transforming traditional hospital-based medical examination approaches. This paper proposes a novel transmit scheme for fog computing-enabled IoMT that leverages uplink and downlink rate splitting (RS). Fog computing allows offloading partial computation tasks to the edge server and processing the remainder of the tasks locally. The uplink RS and downlink RS utilize their flexible interference management capabilities to suppress offloading and feedback delay. Our overarching goal is to minimize the total time cost for task offloading, data processing, and result feedback. The resulting problem requires the joint design of task offloading, computing resource allocation, uplink beamforming, downlink beamforming, and common rate allocation. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we introduce several auxiliary variables and then construct accurate surrogates to smooth the achievable rate. Moreover, we derive the optimal computation resource allocation per user with closed-form expressions. On this basis, we recast the computing resource allocation and energy consumption at the base station to a convex constraint set. We finally develop an alternating optimization algorithm to update the auxiliary variable and inherent variable alternately. Simulation results show that our transmit scheme and algorithm exhibit considerable performance enhancements over several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Switched Vector Field-based Guidance for General Reference Path Following in Planar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference path following is a key component in the functioning of almost all engineered autonomous agents. Among several path following guidance methods in existing literature, vector-field-based guidance approach has got wide attention because of its simplicity and guarantee of stability under a broad class of scenarios. However, the usage of same cross-track-error-dependent structure of desired vector field in most of the existing literature irrespective of instantaneous cross-track error and course angle of unmanned vehicle makes it quite restrictive in attaining faster convergence and also leads to infeasibly high turn rate command for many scenarios. To this end, this paper presents a novel switched vector field-based guidance for following a general reference path, in which the structure of the desired vector field depends on instantaneous cross-track-error and vehicle's course angle. While the developed method ensures faster convergence, it also ensures that the guidance command always stays within a realistic threshold satisfying its curvature constraint, thus making it more real-life implementable for autonomous vehicles with kino-dynamic constraints. Theoretical analysis for convergence of the developed guidance scheme is presented. Possibilities of undesirable chattering at phase transitions are also eliminated. Numerical simulation studies are presented to validate the satisfactory performance of the developed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Duty Cycling Management and Wake-up for Energy Harvesting IoT Networks with Correlated Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for energy-neutral Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where the IoT devices (IoTDs) rely entirely on their energy harvesting capabilities to sustain operation. We use a Markov chain to represent the operation and transmission states of the IoTDs, a modulated Poisson process to model their energy harvesting process, and a discrete-time Markov chain to model their battery state. The aim is to efficiently manage the duty cycling of the IoTDs, so as to prolong their battery life and reduce instances of low-energy availability. We propose a duty-cycling management based on K- nearest neighbors, aiming to strike a trade-off between energy efficiency and detection accuracy. This is done by incorporating spatial and temporal correlations among IoTDs' activity, as well as their energy harvesting capabilities. We also allow the base station to wake up specific IoTDs if more information about an event is needed upon initial detection. Our proposed scheme shows significant improvements in energy savings and performance, with up to 11 times lower misdetection probability and 50\% lower energy consumption for high-density scenarios compared to a random duty cycling benchmark.</description>

      <title>Industrial Application of the Shapley value-based Redispatch Cost Allocation to Large-Scale Power Grids requires AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A burgeoning topic in the current energy transition are the huge costs of redispatch congestion management (CM) in large transmission systems. One of the German transmission system operators (TSOs) raised the critical inquiry of how to allocate the redispatch costs amongst TSOs in an equitable and beneficial way. Previously, a Shapley value-based approach has been introduced on small test grids, using the linear DC approximation of optimal power flow (OPF). However, within the application of CM, its feasibility and accuracy for large-scale power grids and its impact on the computed congestions remain uncertain. Therefore, this study investigates the applicability of the DC OPF compared to the exact AC OPF with regard to the Shapley values, for both small and large-scale grids. Numerical simulation shows significant differences in the congested lines, the overall redispatch costs, and the Shapley values. These findings suggest that for future CM, the TSOs should further investigate AC OPF solutions.</description>

      <title>Systematic interval observer design for linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first propose systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant systems, under standard assumptions. Historically, such designs rely on transformations with certain limitations into a form that is Metzler (for continuous time) or non-negative (for discrete time). We show that they can be effectively replaced with a linear time-invariant transformation that can be easily computed offline. Then, we propose the extension to the time-varying setting, where conventional transformations lack guaranteed outcomes. Academic examples are presented to illustrate our methods.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Adaptive Control of Modular Multilevel Converters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical power conversions are common in a large variety of engineering applications. With reference to AC/DC and DC/AC power conversions, a strong research interest resides in multilevel converters, thanks to the many advantages they provide over standard two-level converters. In this paper, we first provide a power-oriented model of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs), followed by a detailed harmonic analysis. The model is given in the form of a block scheme that can be directly implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The performed harmonic analysis gives a deep and exact understanding of the different terms affecting the evolution of the voltage trajectories in the upper and lower arms of the converter. Next, we propose a new model-based adaptive control scheme for MMCs. The proposed control allows to determine the optimal average capacitor voltages reference in real-time, thus allowing to properly track the desired load current while minimizing the harmonic content in the generated load current itself.</description>

      <title>Dual-band bandpass filter derived from the transformation of a single-band bandpass filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of personal wireless communication devices is driving the need for multi-band frequency selective components including multiplexers and dual-band filters. This paper presents a simple technique for transforming a single-band bandpass filter (BPF) into a dual-band BPF. A second order (two-pole) single-band bandpass filter was chosen for this research, giving rise to a fourth order (four-pole) dual-band bandpass filter after the proposed filter transformation. Both filters were then implemented using the compact U-shaped microstrip resonator for improved device miniaturization. The proposed work features a centre frequency of 1.4 GHz for the single-band bandpass filter, with a span of 3.4% fractional bandwidth. The dual-band bandpass filter operates at 1.35 and 1.45 GHz. The design implementation employs the commercially available Rogers RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate, having a dissipation factor of 0.0023, dielectric constant of 10.7, diel thickness (h) of 1.27 mm, and top/bottom cladding of 35 microns. The results reported for the theoretical and practical designs show good agreement and improved performance when compared to similar research works in literature. The practical responses of the prototype dual-band BPF indicate a good return loss of better than 18 dB across both bands, and an insertion loss of better than 0.1 dB.</description>

      <title>ReefGlider: A highly maneuverable vectored buoyancy engine based underwater robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a capability gap in the design of currently available autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Most AUVs use a set of thrusters, and optionally control surfaces, to control their depth and pose. AUVs utilizing thrusters can be highly maneuverable, making them well-suited to operate in complex environments such as in close-proximity to coral reefs. However, they are inherently power-inefficient and produce significant noise and disturbance. Underwater gliders, on the other hand, use changes in buoyancy and center of mass, in combination with a control surface to move around. They are extremely power efficient but not very maneuverable. Gliders are designed for long-range missions that do not require precision maneuvering. Furthermore, since gliders only activate the buoyancy engine for small time intervals, they do not disturb the environment and can also be used for passive acoustic observations. In this paper we present ReefGlider, a novel AUV that uses only buoyancy for control but is still highly maneuverable from additional buoyancy control devices. ReefGlider bridges the gap between the capabilities of thruster-driven AUVs and gliders. These combined characteristics make ReefGlider ideal for tasks such as long-term visual and acoustic monitoring of coral reefs. We present the overall design and implementation of the system, as well as provide analysis of some of its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Narrow-Path, Dynamic Walking Using Integrated Posture Manipulation and Thrust Vectoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research concentrates on enhancing the navigational capabilities of Northeastern Universitys Husky, a multi-modal quadrupedal robot, that can integrate posture manipulation and thrust vectoring, to traverse through narrow pathways such as walking over pipes and slacklining. The Husky is outfitted with thrusters designed to stabilize its body during dynamic walking over these narrow paths. The project involves modeling the robot using the HROM (Husky Reduced Order Model) and developing an optimal control framework. This framework is based on polynomial approximation of the HROM and a collocation approach to derive optimal thruster commands necessary for achieving dynamic walking on narrow paths. The effectiveness of the modeling and control design approach is validated through simulations conducted using Matlab.</description>

      <title>State-Free Inference of State-Space Models: The Transfer Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach designing a state-space model for deep learning applications through its dual representation, the transfer function, and uncover a highly efficient sequence parallel inference algorithm that is state-free: unlike other proposed algorithms, state-free inference does not incur any significant memory or computational cost with an increase in state size. We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

      <title>Lowering Barriers to Entry for Fully-Integrated Custom Payloads on a DJI Matrice</title>

Abstract: Consumer-grade drones have become effective multimedia collection tools, spring-boarded by rapid development in embedded CPUs, GPUs, and cameras. They are best known for their ability to cheaply collect high-quality aerial video, 3D terrain scans, infrared imagery, etc., with respect to manned aircraft. However, users can also create and attach custom sensors, actuators, or computers, so the drone can collect different data, generate composite data, or interact intelligently with its environment, e.g., autonomously changing behavior to land in a safe way, or choosing further data collection sites. Unfortunately, developing custom payloads is prohibitively difficult for many researchers outside of engineering. We provide guidelines for how to create a sophisticated computational payload that integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 into a DJI Matrice 350. The payload fits into the Matrice's case like a typical DJI payload (but is much cheaper), is easy to build and expand (3D-printed), uses the drone's power and telemetry, can control the drone and its other payloads, can access the drone's sensors and camera feeds, and can process video and stream it to the operator via the controller in real time. We describe the difficulties and proprietary quirks we encountered, how we worked through them, and provide setup scripts and a known-working configuration for others to use.</description>

      <title>Arctic: A Field Programmable Quantum Array Scheduling Technique</title>

Abstract: Advancements in neutral atom quantum computers have positioned them as a valuable framework for quantum computing, largely due to their prolonged coherence times and capacity for high-fidelity gate operations. Recently, neutral atom computers have enabled coherent atom shuttling to facilitate long-range connectivity as a high-fidelity alternative to traditional gate-based methods. However, these inherent advantages are accompanied by novel constraints, making it challenging to create optimal movement schedules.
  In this study I present, to the best of my knowledge, the first compiler pass designed to optimize reconfigurable coupling in zoned neutral atom architectures, while adhering to the reconfigurability constraints of these systems. I approach qubit mapping and movement scheduling as a max-cut and layered cross-minimization problem while enhancing support for spatially complex algorithms through a novel "stacking" feature that balances the qubit array's spatial dimensions with algorithmic parallelism.
  I compare the method across various algorithms sourced from Supermarq and Qasmbench where the compiler pass represents the first exclusively movement-based technique to achieve compilation times consistently within seconds. Results also demonstrate that the approach reduces pulse counts by up to 5x and increases fidelity by up to 7x compared to existing methods on currently available technology.</description>

      <title>A Joint Approach Towards Data-Driven Virtual Testing for Automated Driving: The AVEAS Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing complexity and responsibility of automated driving functions in road traffic and growing scope of their operational design domains, there is increasing demand for covering significant parts of development, validation, and verification via virtual environments and simulation models.
  If, however, simulations are meant not only to augment real-world experiments, but to replace them, quantitative approaches are required that measure to what degree and under which preconditions simulation models adequately represent reality, and thus allow their usage for virtual testing of driving functions. Especially in research and development areas related to the safety impacts of the "open world", there is a significant shortage of real-world data to parametrize and/or validate simulations - especially with respect to the behavior of human traffic participants, whom automated vehicles will meet in mixed traffic.
  This paper presents the intermediate results of the German AVEAS research project (www.aveas.org) which aims at developing methods and metrics for the harmonized, systematic, and scalable acquisition of real-world data for virtual verification and validation of advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving, and establishing an online database following the FAIR principles.</description>

      <title>Path Planning and Motion Control for Accurate Positioning of Car-like Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the planning and control for accurate positioning of car-like robots. We propose a solution that integrates two modules: a motion planner, facilitated by the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm and continuous-curvature (CC) steering technique, generates a CC trajectory as a reference; and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) regulates the robot to accurately track the reference trajectory. Based on the $\mu$-tangency conditions in prior art, we derive explicit existence conditions and develop associated computation methods for a special class of CC paths which not only admit the same driving patterns as Reeds-Shepp paths but also consist of cusp-free clothoid turns. Afterwards, we create an autonomous vehicle parking scenario where the NMPC endeavors to follow the reference trajectory. Feasibility and computational efficiency of the CC steering are validated by numerical simulation. CarSim-Simulink joint simulations statistically verify that with exactly same NMPC, the closed-loop system with CC trajectories as references substantially outperforms the case where Reeds-Shepp trajectories are used as references.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficient Spatio-Temporal Lifetime Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Germany's Core Energy System Dataset: A Data Quality Analysis of the Marktstammdatenregister</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy system in Germany consists of a large number of distributed facilities, including millions of PV plants, wind turbines, and biomass plants. To understand and manage this system efficiently, accurate and reliable information about all facilities is essential. In Germany, the Marktstammdatenregister (MaStR) serves as a central registry for units of the energy system. The reliability of this data is critical for the registry's usefulness, but few validation studies have been published. In this work we provide a review of existing literature that relies on data from the MaStR and thereby show the registry's importance. We then build a data and testing pipeline for relevant data of the registry, with a focus on the two aspects of facility's location and size. All test results are published online in a reproducible workflow. Hence, this work contributes to a reliable data foundation for the German energy system and starts an open validation process of the Marktstammdatenregister from an academic perspective.</description>

      <title>Certifying Stability and Performance of Uncertain Differential-Algebraic Systems: A Dissipativity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for characterizing dissipativity of uncertain systems whose dynamics evolve according to differential-algebraic equations. Sufficient conditions for dissipativity (specializing to, e.g., stability or $L_2$ gain bounds) are provided in the case that uncertainties are characterized by integral quadratic constraints. For polynomial or linear dynamics, these conditions can be efficiently verified through sum-of-squares or semidefinite programming. Performance analysis of the IEEE 39-bus power network with a set of potential line failures modeled as an uncertainty set provides an illustrative example that highlights the computational tractability of this approach; conservatism introduced in this example is shown to be quite minimal.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired Neural Networks for Parameter Learning of Adaptive Cruise Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes and develops a physics-inspired neural network (PiNN) for learning the parameters of commercially implemented adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in automotive industry. To emulate the core functionality of stock ACC systems, which have proprietary control logic and undisclosed parameters, the constant time-headway policy (CTHP) is adopted. Leveraging the multi-layer artificial neural networks as universal approximators, the developed PiNN serves as a surrogate model for the longitudinal dynamics of ACC-engaged vehicles, efficiently learning the unknown parameters of the CTHP. The PiNNs allow the integration of physical laws directly into the learning process. The ability of the PiNN to infer the unknown ACC parameters is meticulously assessed using both synthetic and high-fidelity empirical data of space-gap and relative velocity involving ACC-engaged vehicles in platoon formation. The results have demonstrated the superior predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in learning the unknown design parameters of stock ACC systems from different car manufacturers. The set of ACC model parameters obtained from the PiNN revealed that the stock ACC systems of the considered vehicles in three experimental campaigns are neither $\mathcal{L}_2$ nor $\mathcal{L}_\infty$ string stable.</description>

      <title>Achieving Precisely-Assigned Performance Requirements for Spacecraft Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the attitude control problem of spacecraft, with the objective of achieving precise performance criteria including precise settling time, steady-state error, and overshoot elimination. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Precisely-Assigned Performance (PAP) control scheme. Firstly, we utilize a parameterized function to explicitly characterize a reference for the transient responses, termed the Reference Performance Function (RPF). Subsequently, leveraging the concept of the RPF, we define a performance-satisfied tube region and introduce the concept of control barrier functions to derive a sufficient condition for the state trajectory to converge and remain confined within this tube region. By introducing the concept of Sontag's universal formula for stabilization, a PAP controller, constructed based on the backstepping method, is then designed to guide the system to satisfy these affine constraint conditions, and a disturbance observer is further integrated to handle perturbations. Theoretical proofs are presented to demonstrate the controller's capability to establish the boundedness of the overall system and ensure that each state trajectory will converge into the performance-satisfied region within a finite time duration under any conditions. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Tacit algorithmic collusion in deep reinforcement learning guided price competition: A study using EV charge pricing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Players in pricing games with complex structures are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) aided learning algorithms to make pricing decisions for maximizing profits. This is raising concern for the antitrust agencies as the practice of using AI may promote tacit algorithmic collusion among otherwise independent players. Recent studies of games in canonical forms have shown contrasting claims ranging from none to a high level of tacit collusion among AI-guided players. In this paper, we examine the concern for tacit collusion by considering a practical game where EV charging hubs compete by dynamically varying their prices. Such a game is likely to be commonplace in the near future as EV adoption grows in all sectors of transportation. The hubs source power from the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets as well as from in-house battery storage systems. Their goal is to maximize profits via pricing and efficiently managing the cost of power usage. To aid our examination, we develop a two-step data-driven methodology. The first step obtains the DA commitment by solving a stochastic model. The second step generates the pricing strategies by solving a competitive Markov decision process model using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework. We evaluate the resulting pricing strategies using an index for the level of tacit algorithmic collusion. An index value of zero indicates no collusion (perfect competition) and one indicates full collusion (monopolistic behavior). Results from our numerical case study yield collusion index values between 0.14 and 0.45, suggesting a low to moderate level of collusion.</description>
