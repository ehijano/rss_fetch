      <title>Mikado strategy for the detection of atoms in images of microtrap arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on top of our recent work [arXiv:2502.08511], we introduce a new strategy to solve the problem of detecting atoms in high-resolution images of microtrap arrays. By alternating estimation and detection steps, we get rid of the need for an explicit model to compute the posterior occupancy probability of each site given its a priori optimal estimate. As direct benefits, we show an improved detection accuracy compared to our previous work when the sites are not optically well resolved, and we expect a greater robustness against real experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Link Statistics of Dislocation Network during Strain Hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing its formation.</description>
