      <title>Exploring the neutron star zoo: An observational review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars have shown diverse characteristics, leading us to classify them into different classes. In this proceeding, I review the observational properties of isolated neutron stars: from magnetars, the strongest magnets we know of, to central compact objects, the so-called anti-magnetars, stopping by the rotation-powered pulsars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars. Finally, I highlight a few sources that have exhibited features straddling those of different groups, blurring the apparent diversity of the neutron star zoo.</description>

      <title>X-ray Winds In Nearby-to-distant Galaxies (X-WING) - I: Legacy Surveys of Galaxies with Ultrafast Outflows and Warm Absorbers in $z \sim 0$-$4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an inaugural investigation under the X-ray Winds In Nearby-to-distant Galaxies (X-WING) program, we assembled a dataset comprising 132 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spanning redshifts $z \sim 0$-$4$ characterized by blueshifted absorption lines indicative of X-ray winds. Through an exhaustive review of previous research, we compiled the outflow parameters for 573 X-ray winds, encompassing key attributes such as outflow velocities ($V_{\rm out}$), ionization parameters ($\xi$), and hydrogen column densities. By leveraging the parameters $V_{\rm out}$ and $\xi$, we systematically categorized the winds into three distinct groups: ultrafast outflows (UFOs), low-ionization parameter (low-IP) UFOs, and warm absorbers. Strikingly, a discernible absence of linear correlations in the outflow parameters, coupled with distributions approaching instrumental detection limits, was observed. Another notable finding was the identification of a velocity gap around $V_{\rm out} \sim 10,000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$. This gap was particularly evident in the winds detected via absorption lines within the $\lesssim$2 keV band, indicating disparate origins for low-IP UFOs and warm absorbers. In cases involving Fe XXV/Fe XXVI lines, where the gap might be attributed to potential confusion between emission/absorption lines and the Fe K-edge, the possibility of UFOs and galactic-scale warm absorbers being disconnected is considered. An examination of the outflow and dust sublimation radii revealed a distinction: UFOs appear to consist of dust-free material, whereas warm absorbers likely comprise dusty gas. From 2024, the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is poised to alleviate observational biases, providing insights into the authenticity of the identified gap, a pivotal question in comprehending AGN feedback from UFOs.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in collisionless, high-$\beta$ turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MHD equations, as a collisional fluid model that remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), have long been used to describe turbulence in myriad space and astrophysical plasmas. Yet, the vast majority of these plasmas, from the solar wind to the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, are only weakly collisional at best, meaning that significant deviations from LTE are not only possible but common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the kinetic physics inherent to this weakly collisional regime can fundamentally transform the evolution of such plasmas across a wide range of scales. Here we explore the consequences of pressure anisotropy and Larmor-scale instabilities for collisionless, $\beta \gg 1$ turbulence, focusing on the role of a self-organizational effect known as `magneto-immutability'. We describe this self-organization analytically through a high-$\beta$, reduced ordering of the CGL-MHD equations, finding that it is a robust inertial-range effect that dynamically suppresses magnetic-field-strength fluctuations, anisotropic-pressure stresses, and dissipation due to heat fluxes. As a result, the turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic fluctuations continues below the putative viscous scale to form a robust, nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. These findings are confirmed numerically via Landau-fluid CGL-MHD turbulence simulations that employ a collisional closure to mimic the effects of microinstabilities. We find that microinstabilities occupy a small ($\sim 5\%$) volume-filling fraction of the plasma, even when the pressure anisotropy is driven strongly towards its instability thresholds. We discuss these results in the context of recent predictions for ion-versus-electron heating in low-luminosity accretion flows and observations implying suppressed viscosity in ICM turbulence.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hadronic Interactions in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays within Astrophysical Environments: A Parametric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) accelerated in astrophysical environments have been shown to shape the energy production rate of nuclei escaping from the confinement zone. To address the influence of hadronic interactions, Hadronic Interaction Models (HIM) come into play. In this context, we present a parameterization capable of capturing the outcomes of two distinct HIMs, namely EPOS-LHC and Sibyll2.3d, in terms of secondary fluxes, including escaping nuclei, neutrinos, photons, and electrons. Our parametrization is systematically evaluated against the source codes, both at fixed energy and mass, as well as in a physical case scenario. The comparison demonstrates that our parameterization aligns well with the source codes, establishing its reliability as a viable alternative for analytical or fast Monte Carlo approaches dedicated to the study of UHECR propagation within source environments. This suggests the potential for utilizing our parameterization as a practical substitute in studies focused on the intricate dynamics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Dark Matter Scattering on the Trajectory of High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact on the trajectory of high-energy cosmic-ray protons of scattering off the cosmic dark matter. We compute the scattering angle as a function of the cosmic-ray energy, of the dark matter mass, and of the interaction strength for a few representative choices for the relevant interaction cross section. We find that the typical deflection angle over the cosmic ray path is largely independent of the dark matter mass. Given existing limits on the interaction strength, we compute the average deflection angle. We find that for large interaction cross sections and low cosmic ray energies, the predicted deflection angle is much larger than the angular resolution of very high-energy cosmic-ray observatories such as Pierre Auger.</description>

      <title>Magnetar Eruptions and Electromagnetic Fireworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars are a source of extreme transients observed in different bands, like the fast radio burst (FRB) and associated hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The origin of such outbursts, hard X-rays on the one hand and millisecond duration FRBs on the other hand, is still unknown. We present a global model for various kinds of such magnetar outbursting activities. Crustal surface motions are expected to twist the inner magnetar magnetosphere by shifting the frozen-in footpoints of magnetic field lines. We discuss criteria for the development of instabilities of 3D twisted flux bundles in the force-free dipolar magnetospheres and compare their energetic properties to observations of magnetar X-ray flares. We then review a recently developed FRB generation mechanism in the outer magnetosphere of a magnetar. The strong magnetic pulse induced by a magnetar flare collides with the current sheet of the magnetar wind, compresses and fragments it into a self-similar chain of magnetic islands. Time-dependent plasma currents created during their collisions produce relatively narrow-band GHz emission with luminosities sufficient to explain bright extragalactic FRBs.</description>

      <title>Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Observational Characteristics in Different Regions of the Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and compact objects embedded in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dubbed as ``accretion-modified star" (AMS), often experience hyper-Eddington accretion in the dense gas environment, resulting in powerful outflows as the Bondi explosion and formation of cavities. The varying gas properties across different regions of the AGN disk can give rise to diverse and intriguing phenomena. In this paper, we conduct a study on the characteristics of AMSs situated in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the AGN disk, where growth of the AMSs during the shift inwards is considered. We calculate their multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thermal light curves. Our results reveal that the thermal luminosity of Bondi explosion occurring in the middle region leads to UV flares with a luminosity of $\sim 10^{44}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$. The synchrotron radiation of Bondi explosion in the middle and inner regions peaks at the X-ray band with luminosities of $\sim 10^{43}$ and $\sim 10^{42}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of inverse Compton radiation spans from $10^{42}$ to $10^{43}\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}$ peaked at $\sim 10\,$MeV (outer region) and $\sim$ GeV (middle and inner regions) bands. The observable flares of AMS in the middle region exhibits a slow rise and rapid Gaussian decay with a duration of months, while in the inner region, it exhibits a fast rise and slow Gaussian decay with a duration of several hours. These various SED and light curve features provides valuable insights into the various astronomical transient timescales associated with AGNs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Postshock Turbulence on the Radio Spectrum of Radio Relic Shocks in Merging Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of magnetic turbulence on cosmic ray (CR) electrons through Fermi-II acceleration behind merger-driven shocks in the intracluster medium and examines how the ensuing synchrotron radio emission is influenced by the decay of magnetic energy through dissipation in the postshock region. We adopt simplified models for the momentum diffusion coefficient, specifically considering transit-time-damping resonance with fast-mode waves and gyroresonance with Alfv\'en waves. Utilizing analytic solutions derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory, at the shock location, we introduce a CR spectrum that is either shock-injected or shock-reaccelerated. We then track its temporal evolution along the Lagrangian fluid element in the time domain. The resulting CR spectra are mapped onto a spherical shell configuration to estimate the surface brightness profile of the model radio relics. Turbulent acceleration proves to be a significant factor in delaying the aging of postshock CR electrons, while decaying magnetic fields have marginal impacts due to the dominance of inverse Compton cooling over synchrotron cooling. However, the decay of magnetic fields substantially reduces synchrotron radiation. Consequently, the spatial distribution of the postshock magnetic fields affects the volume-integrated radio spectrum and its spectral index. We demonstrate that the Mach numbers estimated from the integrated spectral index tend to be higher than the actual shock Mach numbers, highlighting the necessity for accurate modeling of postshock magnetic turbulence in interpreting observations of radio relics.</description>

      <title>Choked precessing jets in tidal disruption events and high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a cyclotron absorption line and spectral transition in EXO 2030+375 during 2021 giant outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on HXMT observations of EXO 2030+375 during its 2021 giant outburst, we report the analysis of pulse variations and the broadband X-ray spectrum, and find the presence of a potential cyclotron resonant scattering feature with the fundamental line at 47 keV from both average spectra and phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the outburst, the source reached an X-ray luminosity of $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg /cm/s from 2-105 keV at a distance of 7.1 kpc. The X-ray pulsar at the spin period of 41.27 seconds exhibits complex timing and spectral variations with both energy and luminosity during the outburst. The shapes of the pulses profiles show the single main peak above 20 keV, while appear to exhibit multi-peak patterns in low energy bands, and the transition of pulse profiles from multi-peak to single-peak is observed at $0.8\times 10^{38}$ erg /cm/s, which suggests the evolution from the subcritical luminosity (pencil-beam dominated) to supercritical luminosity (fan-beam dominated) regimes. A dip structure before the energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering features is found in the pulse fraction-energy relation near the peak luminosity. A detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed that the power-law photon index exhibits three distinct trends as luminosity increases, and these changes also signify a spectral transition from sub-critical to super-critical regimes. The critical luminosity infers the magnetic field of $(4.8-6.0)\times 10^{12}$ G, which supports the presence of the cyclotron line at 47 keV. A Comptonization model applied for the broad X-ray spectra during the outburst also suggests the surface magnetic field ranging from $(5-9)\times 10^{12}$ G.</description>

      <title>Modeling non stationary noise in pulsar timing array data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations recently reported evidence for the presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) in their datasets. The main candidate that is expected to produce such a GWB is the population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). Some analyses showed that the recovered signal may exhibit time-dependent properties, i.e. non-stationarity. In this paper, we propose an approximated non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) model obtained from the perturbation of stationary processes. The presented method is applied to the second data release of the European pulsar timing array to search for non-stationary features in the GWB. We analyzed the data in different time slices and showed that the inferred properties of the GWB evolve with time. We find no evidence for such non-stationary behavior and the Bayes factor in favor of the latter is $\mathcal{B}^{NS}_{S} = 1.5$. We argue that the evolution of the GWB properties most likely comes from the \mf{improvement of the observation cadence} with time and \mf{better} characterization of the noise of individual pulsars. Such non-stationary GWB could also be produced by the leakage of non-stationary features in the noise of individual pulsars or by the presence of an eccentric single source.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Galactic supernova remnants and their environment in 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg} using radio surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</description>

      <title>Jet Collimation and Acceleration in the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 1928+738</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using time-resolved multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array data and new KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) observations, we study the structure and kinematics of the jet of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 1928+738. We find two distinct jet geometries as function of distance from the central black hole, with the inner jet having a parabolic shape, indicating collimation, and the outer jet having a conical shape, indicating free expansion of the jet plasma. Jet component speeds display a gradual outward acceleration up to a bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx10$, followed by a deceleration further downstream. The location of the acceleration zone matches the region where the jet collimation occurs; this is the first direct observation of an acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in an FSRQ. The ACZ terminates approximately at a distance of 5.6$\times 10^6$ gravitational radii, which is in good agreement with the sphere of gravitational influence of the supermassive black hole, implying that the physical extent of the ACZ is controlled by the black hole gravity. Our results suggest that confinement by an external medium is responsible for the jet collimation and that the jet is accelerated by converting Poynting flux energy to kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>New physics as a possible explanation for the Amaterasu particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Telescope Array experiment has recently reported the most energetic event detected in the hybrid technique era, with a reconstructed energy of 240 EeV, which has been named "Amaterasu" after the Shinto deity. Its origin is intriguing since no powerful enough candidate sources are located within the region consistent with its propagation horizon and arrival direction. In this work, we investigate the possibility of describing its origin in a scenario of new physics, specifically under a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) assumption. The kinematics of UHECR propagation under a phenomenological LIV approach is investigated. The total mean free path for a particle with Amaterasu's energy increases from a few Mpc to hundreds of Mpc for $-\delta_{\rm{had},0} &gt; 10^{-22}$, expanding significantly the region from which it could have originated. A combined fit of the spectrum and composition data of Telescope Array under different LIV assumptions was performed. The data is best fitted with some level of LIV both with and without Amaterasu. The improvement of the LIV fit is larger when Amaterasu is considered. New physics in the form of LIV could, thus, provide a plausible explanation for the Amaterasu particle.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing protoneutron stars with gamma-ray axionscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in the interior of protoneutron stars (PNS) during supernova (SN) explosions. If these ALPs are also coupled to photons they can convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field. This SN-induced gamma-ray burst can be observable by gamma-ray telescopes like ${\textit Fermi}$-LAT if the SN is in the field of view of the detector. We show that the observable gamma-ray spectrum is sensitive to the production processes in the SN core. In particular, if the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung is the dominant axion production channel, one expects a thermal spectrum with average energy $E_a \simeq 50$ MeV. In this case the gamma-ray spectrum observation allows for the reconstruction of the PNS temperature. In case of a sizable pion abundance in the SN core, one expects a second spectral component peaked at $E_a\simeq 200$ MeV due to axion pionic processes. We demonstrate that, through a dedicated LAT analysis, we can detect the presence of this pionic contribution, showing that the detection of the spectral shape of the gamma-ray signal represents a unique probe of the pion abundance in the PNS.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Observation of Continuous Gravitational Waves from Deformed Fast-spinning White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest within the astrophysics community in highly magnetized and fast-spinning white dwarfs (WDs), commonly referred to as HMWDs. WDs with these characteristics are quite uncommon and possess magnetic fields $\geqslant 10^6$ G, along with short rotation periods ranging from seconds to just a few minutes. Based on our previous work, we analyze the emission of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in HMWDs through two mechanisms: matter accretion and magnetic deformation, which arise due to the asymmetry surrounding the star's rotational axis. Here, we perform a thorough self-consistent analysis, accounting for rotation and employing a realistic equation of state to investigate the stability of stars. Our investigation focuses on the emission of gravitational radiation from six rapidly spinning WDs: five of them are situated within binary systems, while one is an AXP, proposed as a magnetic accreting WD. Furthermore, we apply the matter accretion mechanism alongside the magnetic deformation mechanism to assess the influence of one process on the other. Our discoveries indicate that these WDs could potentially act as GW sources for BBO and DECIGO, depending on specific parameters, such as their mass, the angle ($\alpha$) between the magnetic and rotational axes, and the accumulated mass ($\delta m$) at their magnetic poles, which is influenced by the effect of matter accretion. However, detecting this particular class of stars using the LISA and TianQin space detectors seems unlikely due to the challenging combination of parameters such as a large $\delta m$, a large $\alpha$ angle and a small WD mass value.</description>

      <title>A new timescale-mass scaling for the optical variation of active galactic nuclei across the intermediate-mass to supermassive scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been servicing as an essential avenue of exploring the accretion physics of black hole (BH). There are two commonly used methods for analyzing AGN variability. First, the AGN variability, characterized by the structure function (SF) of a single band, can be well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process on timescales longer than ~weeks, shorter than which departures have been reported. Second, the color variation (CV) between two bands behaves timescale-dependent, raising challenges to the widely accepted reprocessing scenario. However, both the departure from the DRW process and the timescale-dependent CV are hitherto limited to AGNs, mainly quasars, at the supermassive scale. Here, utilizing the high-cadence multi-wavelength monitoring on NGC 4395 harboring an intermediate-mass BH, we unveil at the intermediate-mass scale for the first time, prominent departures from the DRW process at timescales shorter than ~hours in all three nights and bands, and plausible timescale-dependent CVs in the two longest nights of observation. Furthermore, comparing SFs of NGC 4395 to four AGNs at the supermassive scale, we suggest a new scaling relation between the timescale (\uptau; across nearly three orders of magnitude) and the BH mass (M_BH): \uptau \propto M^\gamma_BH where the exponent \gamma is likely ~ 0.6 - 0.8. This exponent differs from most previous measurements, but confirms a few and is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction, suggesting a similar accretion process in AGNs across different mass scales.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of Wide Binaries Induced by the Galactic Tide: Implications for Stellar Mergers and Gravitational-Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of stars can be found in wide binaries with projected separations between $\sim10^2$ and $10^5\,\rm AU$. In the standard lore of binary physics, these would evolve as effectively single stars that remotely orbit one another on stationary Keplerian ellipses. However, embedded in their Galactic environment their low binding energy makes them exceptionally prone to perturbations from the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and encounters with passing stars. Employing a fully relativistic $N$-body integration scheme, we study the impact of these perturbations on the orbital evolution of wide binaries along their trajectory through the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the torques exerted by the Galaxy can cause large-amplitude oscillations of the binary eccentricity to $1-e\lesssim10^{-8}$. As a consequence, the wide binary members pass close to each other at periapsis, which, depending on the type of binary, potentially leads to a mass transfer or collision of stars or to an inspiral and subsequent merger of compact remnants due to gravitational-wave radiation. Based on a simulation of $10^5$ wide binaries across the Galactic field, we find that this mechanism could significantly contribute to the rate of stellar collisions and binary black hole mergers as inferred from observations of Luminous Red Novae and gravitational-wave events by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. We conclude that the dynamics of wide binaries, despite their large mean separation, can give rise to extreme interactions between stars and compact remnants.</description>

      <title>The colliding-wind binary HD 168112</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio surveys of early-type stars have revealed a number of non-thermal emitters. Most of these have been shown to be binaries, where the collision between the two stellar winds is responsible for the non-thermal emission. HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio emitter, whose binary nature has only recently been confirmed spectroscopically. We obtained independent spectroscopic observations to determine its orbit, in addition to radio observations to see if the thermal or non-thermal nature of the emission changes during the periastron passage. We monitored HD 168112 spectroscopically for a 13 year time span. From these data, we determined the orbital parameters, which we compared to the previous results in the literature. From the spectral index of the radio observations, we found how the nature of the emission changes as the system goes through periastron. Combining our results with other literature data allowed us to further constrain the orbital and stellar parameters. We find HD 168112 to have an orbital period of P = 512.17+0.41-0.11 d, an eccentricity of e = 0.7533+0.0053-0.0124, and a mass ratio close to one. From our spectroscopic modelling, we derived the stellar parameters, but we had difficulty arriving at a spectroscopic mass ratio of one. The radio observations around periastron show only thermal emission, suggesting that most of the synchrotron photons are absorbed in the two stellar winds at that phase. Combining our data with the optical interferometry detection, we could constrain the inclination angle to i ~ 63 deg, and the mass of each component to ~ 26 Msun. We have provided an independent spectroscopic confirmation of the binary nature of HD 168112. Although detected as a non-thermal radio emitter, near periastron the radio emission of this highly eccentric system is thermal and is mainly formed in the colliding-wind region.

      <title>Gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-like black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K.~Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking constraints in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a full model of surface-detector responses to extensive air showers. The model is motivated by the principles of air-shower universality and can be applied to different types of surface detectors. Here we describe a parametrization for both water-Cerenkov detectors and scintillator surface detectors, as for instance employed by the upgraded detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using surface detector data, the model can be used to reconstruct with reasonable precision shower observables such as the depth of the shower maximum $X_\text{max}$ and the number of muons $R_\mu$.</description>

      <title>Classical general relativity effects by magnetars with slow rotation and a magnetic dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, the classical tests of general relativity using the Gutsunaev-Manko metric with slow rotation are obtained. This metric represents the spacetime of an object endowed with mass, magnetic dipole moment and angular moment. These tests are the deflection of light, time delay, precession of the periastron and gravitational redshift. We also provide numerical estimations for real magnetars and magnetar candidates from the McGill magnetar catalogue, and for the Sun in the cycles of low activity. Our results find that the magnetic dipole contribution to the deflection of light is significant when compared to the rotation contribution. The magnetic dipole contributions to the periastron precession and the time delay are 3 and 6 orders of magnitude lower than the rotation contribution respectively. For the gravitational redshift, the contribution is negligible within the approximation presented.</description>

      <title>On the source of the Fe K-alpha emission in T Tauri Stars. Radiation induced by relativistic electrons during flares. An application to RY Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T Tauri Stars (TTSs) are magnetically active stars that accrete matter from the inner border of the surrounding accretion disc; plasma gets trapped into the large scale magnetic structures and falls onto the star, heating the surface through the so-called accretion shocks. The X-ray spectra of the TTSs show prominent Fe II Kalpha fluorescence emission at 6.4keV that cannot be explained in a pure accretion scenario. Neither, it can be produced by the hot coronal plasma.
  TTSs display all signs of magnetic activity and magnetic reconnection events are expected to occur frequently. In these events, electrons may get accelerated to relativistic speeds and their interaction with the environmental matter may result in Fe Kalpha emission. It is the aim of this work to evaluate the expected Fe Kalpha emission in the context of the TTS research and compare it with the actual Fe Kalpha measurements obtained during the flare detected while monitoring RY Tau with the XMM-Newton satellite. The propagation of high-energy electrons in dense gas generates a cascade of secondary particles that results in an electron shower of random nature whose evolution and radiative throughput is simulated in this work using the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE. A set of conditions representing the environment of the TTSs where these showers may impinge has been taken into account to generate a grid of models that can aid to the interpretation of the data. The simulations show that the electron beams produce a hot spot at the point of impact; strong Fe Kalpha emission and X-ray continuum radiation are produced by the spot. This emission is compatible with RY Tau observations. The Fe Kalpha emission observed in TTSs could be produced by beams of relativistic electrons accelerated in magnetic reconnection events during flares.</description>

      <title>Antiglitch Inconsistent With Magnetar Model of AXP</title>

      <description>arXiv:1307.0586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed antiglitch of AXP 1E 2259+586 is inconsistent with magnetar models, but may be explained as the consequence of sudden accretion of retrograde matter or "propeller" interaction with surrounding matter. AXP/SGR are explained as single neutron stars accompanied by fallback matter from their natal supernovae. Their phenomenology may be partly accretional and partly the result of dissipation of magnetic energy.</description>

      <title>Nozzle Shocks, Disk Tearing and Streamers Drive Rapid Accretion in 3D GRMHD Simulations of Warped Thin Disks</title>

Abstract: The angular momentum of gas feeding a black hole (BH) is typically misaligned with respect to the BH spin, resulting in a tilted accretion disk. Rotation of the BH drags the surrounding space-time, manifesting as Lense-Thirring torques that lead to disk precession and warping. We study these processes by simulating a thin ($H/r=0.02$), highly tilted ($\mathcal{T}=65^\circ$) accretion disk around a rapidly rotating ($a=0.9375$) BH at extremely high resolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR. The disk becomes significantly warped and continuously tears into two individually precessing sub-disks. We find that mass accretion rates far exceed the standard $\alpha$-viscosity expectations. We identify two novel dissipation mechanisms specific to warped disks that are the main drivers of accretion, distinct from the local turbulent stresses that are usually thought to drive accretion. In particular, we identify extreme scale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When the scale height compresses, `nozzle' shocks form, dissipating orbital energy and driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme dissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of low-angular momentum `streamers' that rain down onto the inner sub-disk, shocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk causes it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH spin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the standard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on much shorter timescales than expected in $\alpha$-disks, potentially explaining some of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mapping Obscured Star Formation in the Host Galaxy of FRB 20201124A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution 1.5 $-$ 6 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate SFR $\approx 8.9\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, approximately $\approx 2.5-6$ times larger than optically-inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of $L_{\rm 6.0 \ GHz}$ $\lesssim$ 1.8 $\times 10^{27}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of $\gtrsim 10^{5}$ yr in each model, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The understanding of neutron star equation of state hinges on a comprehensive analysis of multi-messenger, multi-wavelength data. The recent scrutiny of PSR J0030+0451 data by NICER introduces complexities, unveiling a tension with another X-ray observation of the central compact object in HESS J1731-347, specifically concerning the mass-radius constraint of low-mass neutron stars. This tension persists when integrating NICER's updated data with LIGO/Virgo's gravitational-wave data from the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. Despite attempts to reconcile these disparate observations, the current combined data still can not distinguish different types of neutron stars -- whether they are pure neutron stars or hybrid stars. Bayesian inference indicates only modest changes in the posterior ranges of parameters related to the nuclear matter and deconfinement phase transition. This ongoing exploration underscores the intricate challenges in precisely characterizing neutron stars. It also points out that it is possible to probe the equation of state at different density regimes from future more accurate radii of neutron stars with various masses.</description>

      <title>The polarization-angle flip in GRB prompt emission</title>

Abstract: Aims. We aim to provide an explanation for the PA rotation in GRBs and find the physical conditions that lead to the rotation by 90 degrees in the toroidal magnetic-field (MF) model. Moreover, we present some observable polarization properties in the MF model that can be tested in the future. Results. We find that the PA rotation in the toroidal MF is primarily related to three critical factors: the viewing angle, the jet opening angle, and the jet Lorentz factor. Additionally, the PA can experience flips of 90 degrees twice. The conditions for the flips are $q \gtrsim 0.5$ (except for $q\simeq 1$) and $y_j =(\Gamma \theta_j)^2 \gtrsim 4$. However, the two flips in the PA might not be concurrently observable due to the constraint of flux. Taking these conditions into account and assuming a random orientation between the jet axis and the line of sight (LOS), we obtain a theoretical upper limit (without any constraints) for the observed rate of GRBs in the X-ray or $\gamma$-ray band displaying the flips in PA as $R_{ch} \lesssim 80\%$. We further constrain the observed rate as $R_{ch} \sim 16\%$ according to the maximal post-flip polarized flux level, where the observed rate of single and double flips each account for $\sim 8\%$. It should be noted that the observed rates are different in various wavebands. The observed rate of the second PA flip in the optical bands should be higher than that in the X-ray or $\gamma$-ray band since the flux in the optical band declines much slower than that in the X-ray or $\gamma$-ray band. Moreover, when the LOS is close to the jet edge ($q\to 1$), it is the easiest case in which to observe the 90-degree PA flip due to the relatively high post-flip polarized flux level.</description>

      <title>Unified equations of state for cold nonaccreting neutron stars with Brussels-Montreal functionals. V. Improved parametrization of the nucleon density distributions</title>

Abstract: We previously studied the inner crust and the pasta mantle of a neutron star within the 4th-order extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) approach with consistent proton shell corrections added perturbatively via the Strutinsky integral (SI) theorem together with the contribution due to pairing. To speed up the computations and avoid numerical problems, we adopted parametrized nucleon density distributions. However, the errors incurred by the choice of the parametrization are expected to become more significant as the mean baryon number density is increased, especially in the pasta mantle where the differences in the energy per nucleon of the different phases are very small, typically a few keV. To improve the description of these exotic structures, we discuss the important features that a nuclear profile should fulfill and introduce two new parametrizations. Performing calculations using the BSk24 functional, we find that these parametrizations lead to lower ETF energy solutions for all pasta phases than the parametrization we adopted before and more accurately reproduce the exact equilibrium nucleon density distributions obtained from unconstrained variational calculations. Within the ETFSI method, all parametrizations predict the same composition in the region with quasi-spherical clusters. However, the two new parametrizations lead to a different mantle structure at mean baryon densities above about 0.07 fm^-3, at which point lasagna is energetically favored. Interestingly, spherical clusters reappear in the pasta region. The inverted pasta phases such as bucatini and Swiss cheese are still found in the densest region above the core in all cases.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Ray Sources can be Gamma-ray Dim</title>

Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, accelerated hadrons that can exceed energies of $10^{20}$ eV, are the highest-energy particles ever observed. While the sources producing UHECRs are still unknown, the Pierre Auger Observatory has detected a large-scale dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 8 EeV. In this work, we explore whether resolved gamma-ray sources can reproduce the Auger dipole. We use various Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogs as sources of cosmic rays in CRPropa simulations. We find that in all cases, the simulated dipole has an amplitude significantly larger than that measured by Auger, even when considering large extragalactic magnetic field strengths and optimistic source weighting schemes. Our result implies that the resolved gamma-ray sources are insufficient to account for the population of sources producing the highest-energy cosmic rays, and there must exist a population of UHECR sources that lack gamma-ray emission or are unresolved by the current-generation gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as "magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this Letter, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This "magnetar-star binary engine" model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

Abstract: We compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, namely tidal heating, in an eccentric orbit. The change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion. We compute the result for both the spinning and non-spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion, namely $\xi$. We demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity. Since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time we also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency $\xi_{\phi}$. In the process, we developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity, $e_0$. These results are computed taking account of the spin of the binary components. The prescription can be used to compute very high-order corrections of initial eccentricity. We use it to find the contribution to eccentricity up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$ in the spinning binary. We also provide an approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^n)$, where $n$ is any odd number. With this, we compute approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^7)$ and $\mathcal{O}(e_0^9)$ for non-spinning binary. Using the computed expression of eccentricity, we derived the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, both rotating and non-rotating, in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$. We also compute leading order dephasing in both cases analytically up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$ and study its impact.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa--modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa--like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton's law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.</description>

Abstract: $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars infer the presence of large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, but their origin remains a mystery. Using recent data from MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT, we investigate whether the large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium could have been generated by a first-order electroweak phase transition in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). We study two representative scenarios where we vary the initial conditions of the magnetic field and the plasma, assuming either a primordial magnetic field with maximal magnetic helicity or a primordial magnetic field with negligible magnetic helicity in a plasma with kinetic helicity. By considering a primordial magnetic field with maximal helicity and applying the conservative constraints derived from MAGIC and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, we demonstrate that a first-order electroweak phase transition within the 2HDM may account for the observed intergalactic magnetic fields in the case of the strongest transitions. We show that this parameter space also predicts strong gravitational wave signals in the reach of space-based detectors such as LISA, providing a striking multi-messenger signal of the 2HDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper compiles the model parameters and zero-temperature properties of an extensive collection of published theoretical nuclear interactions, including 255 non-relativistic (Skyrme-like) forces, 270 relativistic mean field (RMF) and point-coupling (RMF-PC) forces, and 13 Gogny-like forces. This forms the most exhaustive tabulation of model parameters to date. The properties of uniform symmetric matter and pure neutron matter at the saturation density are determined. Symmetry properties found from the second-order term of a Taylor expansion in neutron excess are compared to the energy difference of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation density. Selected liquid-droplet model parameters, including the surface tension and surface symmetry energy, are determined for semi-infinite surfaces. Theoretical liquid droplet model neutron skin thicknesses of the neutron-rich closed-shell nuclei $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb are compared to published theoretical Hartree-Fock and experimental results. A similar comparison is made between theoretical liquid-droplet and experimental values of dipole polarizabilities. In addition, radii, binding energies, moments of inertia and tidal deformabilities of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 M$_\odot$ neutron stars are computed. An extensive correlation analysis of bulk matter, nuclear structure, and low-mass neutron star properties is performed and compared to nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>First Detailed Calculation of Atmospheric Neutrino Foregrounds to the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background in Super-Kamiokande</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) -- a probe of the core-collapse mechanism and the cosmic star-formation history -- has not been detected, but its discovery may be imminent. A significant obstacle for DSNB detection in Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) is detector backgrounds, especially due to atmospheric neutrinos (more precisely, these are foregrounds), which are not sufficiently understood. We perform the first detailed theoretical calculations of these foregrounds in the range 16--90 MeV in detected electron energy, taking into account several physical and detector effects, quantifying uncertainties, and comparing our predictions to the 15.9 livetime years of pre-gadolinium data from Super-K stages I--IV. We show that our modeling reasonably reproduces this low-energy data as well as the usual high-energy atmospheric-neutrino data. To accelerate progress on detecting the DSNB, we outline key actions to be taken in future theoretical and experimental work. In a forthcoming paper, we use our modeling to detail how low-energy atmospheric-neutrino events register in Super-K and suggest new cuts to reduce their impact.</description>

      <title>New binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3b data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of 6 new candidate binary black hole (BBH) merger signals in the publicly released data from the second half of the third observing run (O3b) of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported 35 compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in their analysis of the O3b data [1], with 30 BBH mergers having coincidence in the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We confirm 17 of these for a total of 23 detections in our analysis of the Hanford-Livingston coincident O3b data. We identify candidates using a search pipeline employing aligned-spin quadrupole-only waveforms. Our pipeline is similar to the one used in our O3a coincident analysis [2], except for a few improvements in the veto procedure and the ranking statistic, and we continue to use an astrophysical probability of one half as our detection threshold, following the approach of the LVK catalogs. Most of the new candidates reported in this work are placed in the upper and lower-mass gap of the black hole (BH) mass distribution. We also identify a possible neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. We expect these events to help inform the black hole mass and spin distributions inferred in a full population analysis.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in dark matter: energy condition and sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of the environment around a black hole in detail. We introduce non-vanishing radial pressure in a manner analogous to compact stars. We examine both isotropic and anisotropic fluid configurations with and without radial pressure respectively. Our focus extends beyond just dark matter density to the vital role of the energy condition and sound speed in the spacetime of a black hole immersed in matter. In cases of anisotropic pressure with vanishing radial pressure, all profiles violate the dominant energy condition near the BH, and the tangential sound speed exceeds light speed for all dark matter profiles. In our second approach, without assuming vanishing radial pressure, we observe similar violations and superluminal sound speeds. To rectify this, we introduce a hard cutoff for the sound speed, ensuring it remains subluminal. As a consequence, the energy condition is also satisfied. However, this results in increased density and pressure near the BH. This raises questions about the sound speed and its impact on the density structure, as well as questions about the validity of the model itself. With the matter distribution, we also compute the metric for different configurations. It reveals sensitivity to the profile structure. The metric components point towards the horizon structure.</description>

      <title>Safety first: Stability and dissipation of line-tied force-free flux tubes in magnetized coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetized plasma columns and extended magnetic structures with both footpoints anchored to a surface layer are an important building block of astrophysical dissipation models. Current loops shining in X-rays during the growth of plasma instabilities are observed in the corona of the Sun and are expected to exist in highly magnetized neutron star magnetospheres and accretion disk coronae. For varying twist and system sizes, we investigate the stability of line-tied force-free flux tubes and the dissipation of twist energy during instabilities using linear analysis and time-dependent force-free electrodynamics simulations. Kink modes ($m=1$) and efficient magnetic energy dissipation develop for plasma safety factors $q\lesssim 1$, where $q$ is the inverse of the number of magnetic field line windings per column length. Higher-order fluting modes ($m&gt;1$) can distort equilibrium flux tubes for $q&gt;1$ but induce significantly less dissipation. In our analysis, the characteristic pitch $\tilde{\mu}_0$ of flux tube field lines determines the growth rate ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^3$) and minimum wavelength of the kink instability ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^{-1}$). We use these scalings to determine a minimum flux tube length for the growth of the kink instability for any given $\tilde{\mu}_0$. By drawing analogies to idealized magnetar magnetospheres with varying regimes of boundary shearing rates, we discuss the expected impact of the pitch-dependent growth rates for magnetospheric dissipation in magnetar conditions.</description>

      <title>Consistency of JWST Black Hole Observations with NANOGrav Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even pattern. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment, however, this star is not a pure PISN descendant.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the mass of superradiantly unstable scalar fields around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we compute numerical bounds on the mass $\mu$ of superradiantly unstable scalar fields in a Kerr black hole background using the continued fraction method. We show that the normalized upper bound on the mass $\mu$ increases with the angular momentum number $\ell$ and the azimuthal number $m$, approaching the most stringent analytical bound known to date when $\ell=m \gg 1$. We also provide an analytical fit to the numerically determined mass bound as a function of the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ of the black hole with an accuracy of the order $0.1\%$ for the fundamental mode with $\ell=m=1$, and of the order $1\%$ for higher-order modes (up to $\ell=m=20$). We argue that this analytical fit is particularly useful in astrophysical scenarios, since the lowest $\ell=m$ modes are capable of producing the strongest observable imprints of superradiance.</description>
