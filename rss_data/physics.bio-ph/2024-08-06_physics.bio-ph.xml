      <title>Intermittent Run Motility of Bacteria in Gels Exhibits Power-Law Distributed Dwell Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While bacterial swimming has been well characterized in uniform liquid environments, only little is known about how bacteria propagate through complex environments, such as gel-like matrices or porous media that are typically encountered in tissue or soil. Here, we study swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) in polysaccharide matrices formed by different concentrations of agar. P. putida cells display intermittent run-motility in the gel, where run times are exponentially distributed and intermittently occurring dwell times follow a waiting-time distribution with a power-law decay. An analysis of the turn angle distribution suggests that both, flagella mediated turning as well as mechanical trapping in the agar matrix play a role in the overall swimming pattern. Based on the experimentally observed motility pattern and measured waiting-time distributions, we propose a minimal active particle model which correctly describes the observed time dependence of the mean square displacement of the bacterial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Towards principles of brain network organization and function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain is immensely complex, with diverse components and dynamic interactions building upon one another to orchestrate a wide range of functions and behaviors. Understanding patterns of these complex interactions and how they are coordinated to support collective neural activity and function is critical for parsing human and animal behavior, treating mental illness, and developing artificial intelligence. Rapid experimental advances in imaging, recording, and perturbing neural systems across various species now provide opportunities and challenges to distill underlying principles of brain organization and function. Here, we take stock of recent progresses and review methods used in the statistical analysis of brain networks, drawing from fields of statistical physics, network theory and information theory. Our discussion is organized by scale, starting with models of individual neurons and extending to large-scale networks mapped across brain regions. We then examine the organizing principles and constraints that shape the biological structure and function of neural circuits. Finally, we describe current opportunities aimed at improving models in light of recent developments and at bridging across scales to contribute to a better understanding of brain networks.</description>

      <title>Population genetics: an introduction for physicists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population genetics lies at the heart of evolutionary theory. This topic forms part of many biological science curricula but is rarely taught to physics students. Since physicists are becoming increasingly interested in biological evolution, we aim to provide a brief introduction to population genetics, written for physicists. We start with two background chapters: chapter 1 provides a brief historical introduction to the topic, while chapter 2 provides some essential biological background. We begin our main content with chapter 3 which discusses the key concepts behind Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. Chapter 4 covers the basics of how variation is maintained in populations, while chapter 5 discusses mutation and selection. In chapter 6 we discuss stochastic effects in population genetics using the Wright-Fisher model as our example, and finally we offer concluding thoughts and references to excellent textbooks in chapter 7.</description>

      <title>Generalized, sublethal damage-based mathematical model for improved prediction of clonogenic survival curve flattening upon hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling can offer valuable insights into the behavior of biological systems upon treatment. Different mathematical models (empirical, semi-empirical, and mechanistic) have been designed to predict the efficacy of either hyperthermia (HT), radiotherapy (RT), or their combination. However, mathematical approaches capable of modeling cell survival from shared general principles for both mono-treatments alone and their co-application are rare. Moreover, some cell cultures show dose-dependent saturation in response to HT or RT, manifesting in survival curve flattenings. An advanced survival model must, therefore, appropriately reflect such behavior. We propose a cell survival model to predict the effect of both treatments based on the general principle of sublethal damage (SLD) accumulation for the induction of cell death and irreversible proliferation arrest. Our approach extends Jung's model on heat-induced cellular inactivation by incorporating dose-dependent recovery rates that delineate changes in SLD restoration. The resulting unified model (Umodel) accurately describes not only HT but also RT survival outcomes, is applicable to simultaneous thermoradiotherapy modeling, and particularly suited to reproduce and predict survival curve flattening phenomena. We demonstrate the Umodel's robust performance (R2 &gt; 0.95) based on numerous clonogenic cell survival data sets from the literature and our experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent sharp interface theory of active condensate dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates help organize the cell cytoplasm and nucleoplasm into spatial compartments with different chemical compositions. A key feature of such compositional patterning is the local enrichment of enzymatically active biomolecules which, after transient binding via molecular interactions, catalyze reactions among their substrates. Thereby, biomolecular condensates provide a spatial template for non-uniform concentration profiles of substrates. In turn, the concentration profiles of substrates, and their molecular interactions with enzymes, drive enzyme fluxes which can enable novel non-equilibrium dynamics. To analyze this generic class of systems, with a current focus on self-propelled droplet motion, we here develop a self-consistent sharp interface theory. In our theory, we diverge from the usual bottom-up approach, which involves calculating the dynamics of concentration profiles based on a given chemical potential gradient. Instead, reminiscent of control theory, we take the reverse approach by deriving the chemical potential profile and enzyme fluxes required to maintain a desired condensate form and dynamics. The chemical potential profile and currents of enzymes come with a corresponding power dissipation rate, which allows us to derive a thermodynamic consistency criterion for the passive part of the system (here, reciprocal enzyme-enzyme interactions). As a first use case of our theory, we study the role of reciprocal interactions, where the transport of substrates due to reactions and diffusion is, in part, compensated by redistribution due to molecular interactions. More generally, our theory applies to mass-conserved active matter systems with moving phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>A brief tutorial on information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the 2023 Les Houches Summer School on Theoretical Biological Physics, several students asked for some background on information theory, and so we added a tutorial to the scheduled lectures. This is largely a transcript of that tutorial, lightly edited. It covers basic definitions and context rather than detailed calculations. We hope to have maintained the informality of the presentation, including exchanges with the students, while still being useful.</description>

      <title>Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement</title>

Abstract: Motility coupled to responsive behavior is essential for many microorganisms to seek and establish appropriate habitats. One of the simplest possible responses, reversing the direction of motion, is believed to enable filamentous cyanobacteria to form stable aggregates or accumulate in suitable light conditions. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous morphology in combination with responding to light gradients by reversals has consequences far beyond simple accumulation: Entangled aggregates form at the boundaries of illuminated regions, harnessing the boundary to establish local order. We explore how the light pattern, in particular its boundary curvature, impacts aggregation. A minimal mechanistic model of active flexible filaments resembles the experimental findings, thereby revealing the emergent and generic character of these structures. This phenomenon may enable elongated microorganisms to generate adaptive colony architectures in limited habitats, or guide the assembly of biomimetic fibrous materials.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Overshoot in SIR Models with Nonlinear Incidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01653v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically for nonlinear functions in the number of susceptibles. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Theory for Adaptive Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01403v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolution and learning. We present a path-integral approach \`a la Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) to analyse nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>
