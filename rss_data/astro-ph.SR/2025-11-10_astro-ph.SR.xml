      <title>HiSAXy: A fast methodology for solar wind structure identification in millions of time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybridized unsupervised clustering algorithm Hisaxy as a novel way to identify frequently occurring magnetic structures embedded in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind. The Hisaxy algorithm utilizes a combination of indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (iSAX) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to efficiently identify clusters of patterns embedded in time series data. We utilized Hisaxy to identify small-scale structures, known as discontinuities, embedded in time series measurements of the IMF. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to significantly reduce the amount of human analysis hours required to identify these structures, all the while maintaining a high degree of self similarity within a given cluster of time series data.</description>

      <title>Secondary small-scale dynamics of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiescent solar prominences show distinct small-scale dynamics in observations. Their internal density contrasts with the surrounding corona make them susceptible to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to vertically structured prominence morphologies when observed at the solar limb. As a result, prominences develop bubbles and plumes, along with secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-ups along their edges. Recent observations also suggest magnetic reconnection events within the RT-driven turbulent flows. We perform high-resolution 2.5D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 11.7$ km in a 2D domain of size 30 Mm$\times$30 Mm and evolving the system for approximately 10 minutes of solar time. A dense, magnetic pressure supported prominence serves as the initial state, which becomes unstable at the prominence-corona interface. The resulting interaction between RT and KH instabilities leads to the formation of current sheets and localized reconnection events. The reconnection-driven outflows form energetic jets that enhance energy transport and dissipation across the prominence. We analyze our high-resolution prominence simulation using synthetic images of the broadband SDO/AIA 094, 171, and 193 \r{A} and narrowband H$\alpha$ filters, to compare the developing fine-scale structures with their observational counterparts. Most secondary instabilities emerge in the hotter coronal regions surrounding the cooler prominence core. While our simulated features match observed scales, speeds, and duration, the simulated activity remains concentrated in hot, surrounding coronal plasma rather then the cool prominence material, implying that key physical ingredients may be missing. Future 3D studies in more realistic magnetic configurations are required to address these limitations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Listing of 208 Nova White Dwarf Masses As the Primary Determinant of Spectral-Class and Light-Curve-Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Galactic novae, I calculate and collect a comprehensive catalog of 208 measures of white dwarf (WD) masses ($M_{\rm WD}$) and 232 measures of average $V$ magnitudes in quiescence ($V_q$). These are collected into a comprehensive catalog of most fundamental properties of all 402 known Galactic novae. The nova light curve and spectral classes are determined primarily by $M_{\rm WD}$. With an apparently clean cutoff, nova with light curve shapes in the S, P, O, and C classes have $&gt;$0.95 $M_{\odot}$, while the J, D, and F class novae have $&lt;$0.95 $M_{\odot}$. The speed class of the light curves is $t_3$=$10^{(-1.73M_{\rm WD})}$$\times$1900 days. The spectral class of novae is Fe II below 1.15 $M_{\odot}$, is He/N above 1.15 $M_{\odot}$, and the Hybrid novae are spread around this division. Neon novae have WD masses ranging from 0.53--1.37 $M_{\odot}$, with 76\% being measured to be below their minimum formation mass of 1.2 $M_{\odot}$, demonstrating that most are losing mass over each eruption cycle. The FWHM velocity of the Balmer line profiles is close to 0.23 times the WD escape velocity, or roughly $10^{(M_{\rm WD}/2)}$$\times$500 km s$^{-1}$ for $&lt;$1.3 $M_{\odot}$. And all the known Galactic recurrent novae are $&gt;$1.2 $M_{\odot}$. For issues involving the late expansion of the ejecta, I find that the visibility of shells is strongly biased towards novae with orbital periods $&lt;$0.33 days, and that the visibility of $\gamma$-rays from the shells are strongly biased towards novae with fast declines, with $t_3$ a proxy for the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of 10 - 50 MeV Solar Proton Events at Lagrange Point 1 and the Geostationary Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar proton events (SPEs) pose radiation hazards, disrupt technology, and impact operations on Earth and in space, making continuous monitoring essential. We compare 10-50 MeV proton flux measurements from SOHO/EPHIN at Lagrange Point 1 (L1) with those from NOAA/GOES in geostationary orbit (GEO) during Solar Cycle 23 and most of Cycle 24. We identify 83 &gt;=10 pfu SPEs observed at both locations and classify them into S1-S4 categories (comparable to NOAA's solar radiation storm scales). EPHIN detected earlier onsets and longer durations across all categories, along with earlier peaks and ends for S1-S3, while GOES recorded slightly earlier peak and end times for S4. S1 median timing offsets (EPHIN relative to GOES) were -20 +/- 50 min (onsets), -1.00 +/- 1.42 hr (peaks), and -1.08 +/- 2.21 hr (ends), with similar trends for S2-S3 and near-simultaneity for S4 (peaks ~ -0.17 +/- 1.62 hr; ends ~ +0.04 +/- 3.33 hr). Flux comparisons show that EPHIN measurements modestly exceed GOES for S1 (median ratios ~1.11 for peaks and ~1.06 for fluence) and are lower than GOES for stronger events (peaks ~0.97 +/- 0.29, 0.84 +/- 0.21; fluence ~0.84 +/- 0.16, 0.75 +/- 0.16 for S2-S3). The EPHIN-to-GOES peak flux and fluence ratios reach 0.16 +/- 0.03 and 0.29 +/- 0.07, respectively, for S4 events, originating from contamination of lower-energy GOES channels. Correlation analyses show no significant flux dependence on geomagnetic indices, field strength, or spacecraft position, suggesting minimal near-Earth modulation of &gt;=10 MeV proton access at GEO. These results highlight systematic differences in how SPEs manifest at L1 versus GEO and offer practical guidance for forecasting beyond Earth's magnetosphere, supporting mission planning for near-Earth and cislunar exploration, including Artemis.</description>

      <title>Using ML-based Regression Techniques to Mitigate GOES Energetic Proton Flux Data Contamination and Magnetospheric Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positioned at geostationary orbit (GEO) ~36,000 km above Earth, NOAA's GOES series has recorded real-time energetic proton flux measurements crucial for space weather monitoring for over three decades. Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.</description>

      <title>Empirical measures of the largest amounts of magnetically-induced radius inflation in low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to precise empirical estimates of stellar radii in recent decades has revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions. The largest inflations are found in magnetically active stars. Although various attempts have been made to incorporate magnetic effects into stellar structure codes, a major source of uncertainty is associated with our lack of knowledge as to how the field strength varies inside the star. Here, we point out that a recent study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may enable us for the first time to set an upper limit Bc on the field strengths inside the 88 stars in the sample. According to our magneto-convective model, the largest empirical inflations reported by Cruz et al. can be replicated if Bc is about 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than 0.65 MSun. On the other hand, in lower mass stars, especially those with masses less than 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the largest empirical inflations may require significantly stronger fields, i.e. Bc approximately 100-300 kG.</description>

      <title>The Dual Nature of Solar Wind Structuring: Resonant Standing Waves and Laval Nozzle Dynamics in Coronal Streamers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs represent a fundamental challenge to conventional solar wind paradigms. Through systematic analysis of multi-instrument observations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that coronal streamers operate as dual-nature systems: magnetohydrodynamic resonators that establish global periodicity through standing waves (122, 61, 41 minutes) and Laval nozzles that generate local flow structures through shock-driven oscillations (93, 47, 31, 23 minutes). The resonant mechanism dominates PDS formation, explaining their universal occurrence across 85\% of streamers, coherence over 10+ cycles, and persistence to 1 AU with only 0.1\% energy loss. Nozzle oscillations, while limited to 35\% of overexpanded streamers and maintaining only 1-2 cycle coherence, play crucial secondary roles in vortex formation and provide the essential converging-diverging geometry for supersonic solar wind acceleration. This dual-mechanism framework resolves longstanding puzzles in solar wind structuring while revealing the hierarchical organization of standing-wave and flow processes in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers and/or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of highly energetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Calcium Excess in Novae: Beyond Nuclear Physics Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine Ca abundances in classical novae from spectroscopic observations spanning 65 years and investigate whether they are systematically high compared to those predicted by nova models. For the first time, we perform Monte Carlo simulations assessing the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on abundances predicted by multi-zone nova models. While the Ca abundances in the models are sensitive to variations of rates of the reactions 37Ar(p,gamma)38K and 38K(p,gamma)39Ca, the nuclear physics uncertainties of these reactions cannot account for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted Ca abundances in novae. Furthermore, the overabundance of Ca has important implications for measuring 7Be in nova ejecta, as Ca lines are used to estimate 7Be abundances. If the Ca abundance is incorrectly determined, it could lead to inaccurate 7Be abundance estimates. Possible alternative explanations for the observed Ca overabundance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the Predictive Potentiality of Photospheric Magnetic Parameters for Distinguishing Confined from Eruptive Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question often arises as to why some solar flares are confined in the lower corona while others, termed eruptive flares, are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Here we intend to rank the importance of pre-flare magnetic parameters of active regions in their potentiality to predict whether an imminent flare will be eruptive or confined. We compiled a dataset comprising 277 solar flares of GOES-class M1.0 and above, taking place within 45 deg from the disk center between 2010 and 2023, involving 94 active regions. Among the 277 flares, 135 are confined and 142 are eruptive. Our statistical analysis reveals that the magnetic parameters that are most relevant to the flare category are: total unsigned magnetic flux $\Phi$, mean magnetic shear angle $\Theta$ along the polarity inversion line (PIL), photospheric free magnetic energy $E_f$, and centroid distance $d$ between opposite polarities. These four parameters are not independent of each other, but in combination, might be promising in distinguishing confined from eruptive flares. For a subset of 77 flares with high-gradient PILs, the area of high free energy regions ($A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$) becomes the most effective parameter related to the flare type, with confined flares possessing larger $A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$ than eruptive ones. Our results corroborate the general concept that the eruptive behavior of solar flares is regulated by an interplay between the constraining overlying flux, which is often dominant in both $\Phi$ and $E_f$ and related to $d$, and the current-carrying core flux, which is related to $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>High-spectral Resolution, Multi-wavelength Center-to-limb Observations of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center-to-limb variations (CLVs) of photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines were obtained in 2025 July and August using drift scans from the echelle spectrograph of the 0.7 m Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (ODT) in Tenerife, Spain. This instrument can observe four spectral regions simultaneously, enabling multi-line spectroscopy with high spectral resolution of various activity features and the quiet Sun in the lower solar atmosphere. The initial results of Halpha observations demonstrate the diagnostic potential of drift scans obtained with a ground-based, high-resolution telescope. Data products include spectroheliograms and maps of physical parameters such as line-of-sight velocity, line width, and line-core intensity. The combination of the CLV from photospheric and chromospheric lines, as well as the wide range of formation heights of the selected lines, renders this dataset ideal for characterizing stellar and exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of using decayless kink oscillations of coronal loops to forecast powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the decayless kink oscillations of solar coronal loops and examines possible changes in their behaviour in active regions (ARs) before powerful solar flares (M- and X-class) and in the absence of powerful flares. To this end, we analysed 14 ARs with powerful flares and 14 ARs without powerful flares. For each event, images obtained in the 171 \AA and 94 \AA AIA/SDO channels with 12-second cadence for 4 hours before the flare were retrieved and analysed. For ARs without powerful flares, arbitrary time intervals of similar duration were considered for comparison. Since the decayless oscillations have a very low amplitude (1-2 AIA/SDO pixels), we used the Motion Magnification technique to amplify the amplitude of these oscillations. Time-distance maps were constructed from the processed images in the 171 \AA channel, from which oscillatory patterns were extracted 'manually'. Wavelet analysis was performed to check for changes in the oscillation period. No systematic changes were found. No obvious differences in the behaviour of oscillations in ARs with and without powerful flares were detected either. Additional information was obtained on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from ARs in the vicinity of the time intervals under consideration. Based on the results of the analysis of a small sample of events, we came to the preliminary conclusion that the registration and analysis of decayless kink oscillations of high (~ 100-600 Mm) coronal loops based on this methodology is not promising for predicting powerful flares and CMEs.</description>

      <title>Co-existence of Internal Gravity Waves and Tayler-Spruit Magnetic Fields in the Radiative Core of Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tayler-Spruit dynamo (TSD) is able to generate a small-scale magnetic field in the differentially rotating stably stratified layers of stars and was recently observed in numerical simulations. In parallel, the propagation of internal gravity waves in stars can be modified in the presence of a magnetic field. Here we first want to estimate the interaction between a magnetic field generated by the TSD and internal gravity waves in the radiative core of low-mass stars. This allows us to then characterise the effect of this interplay on the observed standing modes spectrum and on the internal transport of angular momentum by progressive waves. To do this, we use the STAREVOL evolution code to compute the structure of low-mass rotating stars along their evolution. In particular, we implement a formalism to describe the TSD and estimate the regions where the generated magnetic field is strong enough to change the identity of internal gravity waves to magneto-gravity waves. In addition, we evaluate the possible limitation of angular momentum transport by the combined action of rotation and magnetism. We show that along the pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution, the lowest frequencies of the excited gravity wave spectrum could be converted to magneto-gravity waves by the magnetic field generated by the TSD. During the red-giant branch we find that most of the excited spectrum of progressive internal gravity waves could be converted into magneto-gravity waves in the very central region.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of stellar systems in the solar neighbourhood, wide binaries, and planet-hosting stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis studies stellar multiplicity in the solar neighborhood (d &lt; 10 pc) and in systems hosting planets (d &lt; 100 pc). Using data from the Washington Double Star Catalogue, Gaia DR3, and a comprehensive literature review, it builds the most complete and homogeneous sample of multiple systems within 10 pc. Multiplicity and companion fractions are derived with reduced uncertainties, providing improved statistical reliability. The analysis of orbital periods from one day to millions of years shows that the log-normal cumulative distribution can be seen as a modern revision of \"Opik's law. A key contribution is the study of wide binaries ({\rho} &gt; 1000 arcsec) with Gaia DR3, expanding the known sample by over an order of magnitude and improving astrometric precision. Newly identified companions, including ultracool dwarfs at the M-L boundary and a hot white dwarf, refine the distinction between true binaries and unrelated young moving-group members. The thesis also explores the effect of multiplicity on exoplanetary systems within 100 pc. New stellar companions are found in known planetary systems, with separations for over 200 pairs and parameters compiled for 276 exoplanets. Compared to single-star systems, multiple systems host more massive, short-period, and high-eccentricity planets. About 22% of exoplanetary systems have stellar companions, with significant (&gt; 4 {\sigma}) correlations between high eccentricities and small projected separations, and a weaker (&gt; 2 {\sigma}) trend showing that massive planets (M &gt; 40 M_Earth) orbit closer in multiple systems. Finally, a review of Giovanni Battista Hodierna's 17th-century catalogues shows he compiled the first list of multiple systems over a century earlier than previously believed, advancing the understanding of stellar multiplicity and its influence on planetary formation.</description>

      <title>Near-degeneracy effects in Quadrupolar Mixed Modes. From an Asymptotic Description to Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar (l=1) mixed modes revealed surprisingly weak differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars. Quadrupolar (l=2) mixed modes also contain information on the internal dynamics, but are very rarely characterised due to their low amplitude and the challenging identification of adjacent or overlapping rotationally split multiplets affected by near-degeneracy effects. We aim to extend broadly used asymptotic seismic diagnostics beyond l=1 mixed modes by developing an analogue asymptotic description of l=2 mixed modes, explicitly accounting for near-degeneracy effects that distort their rotational multiplets. We derive a new asymptotic formulation of near-degenerate mixed l=2 modes that describes off-diagonal terms representing the interaction between modes of adjacent radial orders. We implement the formalism within a global Bayesian mode-fitting framework, for a direct fit of all l=0,1,2 modes in the power spectrum density. We are able to asymptotically model the asymmetric rotational splitting present in various radial orders of l=2 modes observed in young red giant stars without the need for any numerical stellar modelling. Applied to the Kepler target KIC 7341231, our formalism yields core and envelope rotation rates consistent with previous numerical modelling, while providing improved constraints from the global and model-independent approach. We also characterise the new target KIC 8179973, measuring its rotation rate and mixed-mode parameters for the first time. The global fit allows for much better precision than standard methods, yielding better constraints for rotation inversions. We place the first observational constraints on the asymptotic l=2 mixed mode parameters (DPi_2,q_2,eps_g2), paving the way towards the use of asymptotic seismology beyond l=1 mixed modes.</description>

      <title>A scaling relationship for non-thermal radio emission from ordered magnetospheres - II. Investigating the efficiency of relativistic electron production in magnetospheres of BA-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic BA stars host dipole-like magnetospheres. When detected as radio sources, their luminosities correlate with the magnetic field and rotation. Rotation is crucial because the mechanism undergirding the relativistic electron production is powered by centrifugal breakouts. CBOs occur wherever magnetic tension does not balance centrifugal force; the resulting magnetic reconnection provides particle acceleration. To investigate how physical conditions at the site of the CBOs affect the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism, we broadly explore the parameter space governing radio emission by increasing the sample of radio-loud magnetic stars. High-sensitivity VLA observations of 32 stars were performed in the hope of identifying new centrifugal magnetospheres and associated CBOs. We calculated gyro-synchrotron spectra using 3D modeling of a dipole-shaped magnetosphere. We evaluated combinations of parameters. The number of relativistic electrons was constrained by the need to produce the emission level predicted by the scaling relationship for the radio emission from magnetic BA stars. About half of the observed stars were detected, with luminosities in agreement with the expected values, reinforcing the robust nature of the scaling relationship for CBO-powered radio emission. Comparing the competing centrifugal and magnetic effects on plasma locked in a rigidly rotating magnetosphere, we located the site of CBOs and inferred the local plasma density. We then estimated the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism needed to produce enough non-thermal electrons to support the radio emission level. Given a constant acceleration efficiency, relativistic electrons represent a fixed fraction of the local thermal plasma. Thus, dense magnetospheres host more energetic particles than less dense ones; consequently, with other parameters similar, they are intrinsically brighter radio sources.</description>

      <title>Modeling Solar Atmosphere Dynamics with MAGEC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the solar atmosphere is challenging due to its layered structure and multi-scale dynamics. We aim to validate the new radiative MHD code MAGEC, which combines the MANCHA and MAGNUS codes into a finite-volume, shock-capturing framework, and to test its performance through 2D simulations of magneto-convection.
  MAGEC is MPI-parallelized and includes improvements for coronal modeling, such as LTE radiative losses and a hyperbolic treatment of thermal conduction that mitigates restrictive time steps. We also estimated its numerical viscosity and resistivity. To assess robustness, we performed 2D simulations covering a domain from 2 Mm below the surface to 18.16 Mm into the corona, using both open and closed magnetic-field configurations. For each case, we analyzed steady-state temperature profiles and the contributions to the internal-energy balance at different heights. A separate experiment examined the role of perpendicular thermal conduction.
  MAGEC reproduced the expected temperature stratification set by boundary conditions and magnetic geometry, and all simulations reached thermal equilibrium. Open-field cases produced higher coronal temperatures than closed, arcade-like fields. Analysis of the explicit and implicit energy terms clarified their relative effects on heating and cooling. Perpendicular thermal conduction, often neglected in coronal models, was found to influence plasma dynamics near reconnection; although local effects are small, they can cumulatively modify the average coronal temperature.
  These results show that MAGEC is a reliable and efficient tool for radiative MHD simulations, well suited to capturing the shocks and dynamic processes of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: II. Gyrotropic Slepian Reconstruction of Solar Wind Electrostatic Analyzer Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity distribution functions (VDF) are an essential observable for studying kinetic and wave-particle processes in solar wind plasmas. To experimentally distinguish modes of heating, acceleration, and turbulence in the solar wind, precise representations of particle phase space VDFs are needed. In the first paper of this series, we developed the Slepian Basis Reconstruction (SBR) method to approximate fully agyrotropic continuous distributions from discrete measurements of electrostatic analyzers (ESAs). The method enables accurate determination of plasma moments, preserves kinetic features, and prescribes smooth gradients in phase space. In this paper, we extend the SBR method by imposing gyrotropic symmetry (g-SBR). Incorporating this symmetry enables high-fidelity reconstruction of VDFs that are partially measured, as from an ESA with a limited field-of-view (FOV). We introduce three frameworks for g-SBR, the gyrotropic Slepian Basis Reconstruction: (A) 1D angular Slepian functions on a polar-cap, (B) 2D Slepian functions in a Cartesian plane, and (C) a hybrid method. We employ model distributions representing multiple anisotropic ion populations in the solar wind to benchmark these methods, and we show that the g-SBR method produces a reconstruction that preserves kinetic structures and plasma moments, even with a strongly limited FOV. For our choice of model distribution, g-SBR can recover $\geq90\%$ of the density when only $20\%$ is measured. We provide the package \texttt{gdf} for open-source use and contribution by the heliophysics community. This work establishes direct pathways to bridge particle observations with kinetic theory and simulations, facilitating the investigation of gyrotropic plasma heating phenomena across the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Radio Emission from the K2-18 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</description>

      <title>SRGt 062340.2-265751 confirmed as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA due to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a &gt;8$\sigma$-significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) represent one of the more interesting ways to address dark matter, at the interface of both cosmology and quantum gravity. It is no surprise then that testing PBHs is a venue of active interest, with several cosmological and astrophysical probes constraining different mass ranges. In this work, we propose novel Solar System scale searches for PBHs, motivated by the unique precision and coverage of local observables. We show that asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs can induce measurable dipolar timing signatures in pulsar timing arrays, while planetary mass PBHs can generate detectable ADAF accretion flares through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies. Together, these complementary approaches open a new observational frontier for probing PBHs across mass ranges that remain unconstrained by conventional cosmological methods.</description>

      <title>On the Energetic Role of Forward Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG 23 IR elemental abundances of 114 giant stars in 41 Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters have been extensively used as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution, as their constituent stars possess shared characteristics, including age, Galactocentric radius, metallicity, and chemical composition. By examining the trends of elemental abundances with metallicity, age, and Galactocentric radius, valuable insights can be gained into the distribution and nucleosynthetic origins of chemical elements across the Galactic disc. The infrared domain in particular facilitates the observation of some elemental abundances that can be challenging or impossible to discern in the optical, for example K and F. The objective of this study is to derive the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of up to 23 elements in 114 stars spanning 41 open clusters using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the present study aims to examine the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. This is achieved by investigating radial abundance gradients, variations in abundance between clusters, and the dependence of chemical abundances on cluster age.</description>

      <title>Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Solar limb faculae: intensity contrast from two vantage points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale magnetic flux concentrations contribute significantly to the brightness variations of the Sun, yet observing them - particularly their magnetic field - near the solar limb remains challenging. Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Picoflares in the Quiet Solar Corona: Solar Orbiter Observations Halfway to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny "campfires" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU.
  We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior.
  These picoflares, spanning $10^{20}$--$10^{24}$ erg, were detected by the Solar Orbiter EUI Imager while the spacecraft was at 0.56 AU from the Sun. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1\% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.</description>

      <title>The Missing Mechanism: Picoflare Heating in the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coronal heating problem has been explored through wave heating and impulsive nanoflare paradigms. Solar Orbiter observations reveal picoflares (10^20-10^24 erg) extending below the Parker-Aschwanden minimal coronal nanoflare limit. These events involve two distinct mechanisms: short-duration looptop tearing-mode reconnection and long-duration footpoint anomalous resistivity. This dual-mechanism framework resolves the long-standing energy partition paradox and bridges photospheric energy injection with coronal thermalization.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of Periodic Density Structures in the Solar Wind: Coronal Streamers as Magnetohydrodynamic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive physical model explaining the origin of Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs with characteristic periods of approximately 45, 80, and 120 minutes. Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q ~ 10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test \textbf{the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions} by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Jet-environment interaction after delayed collapse in binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, where the collapse of the metastable massive neutron star (MNS) remnant leads to the production of an incipient jet having terminal Lorentz factor and Poynting-flux luminosity compatible with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB). We consider different MNS lifetimes of about 25 and 50 ms, long enough for massive polar outflows to emerge before black hole (BH) formation. The interaction of the following BH-driven jet with such polar outflows, responsible for shock heating and possible electromagnetic signatures, is self-consistently captured for the first time. Exploiting an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor scaling as r^-6, we explore the jet propagation up to distances of ~10^4 km. Comparing the outcome of different MNS lifetimes, we find that the latter, by strongly affecting the propagation environment, plays a major role in determining the final properties of the escaping jet. Finally, we consider a non-collapsing case, where the MNS-driven outflow is found too dense and slow to be compatible with a GRB jet, thus favoring a BH central engine scenario.</description>

      <title>On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.</description>
