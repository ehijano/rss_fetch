      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in a (2+1)-D Gauge Theory: The Stringy Nature on a Superconducting Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.</description>

      <title>Chiral and Deconfinement Transitions in Spin-Polarized Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\"afli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.</description>

      <title>Hadron-Hadron Interactions from Lattice QCD: Theory meets Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent developments in the study of hadron-hadron interactions using lattice QCD near the physical pion mass ($m_{\pi} \simeq 146$ MeV), based on the HAL QCD method and its connection to experimental data. In particular, we focus on several key interaction channels shown below. Also, we examine the two-pion exchange (TPE) mechanism, which governs the long-range behavior of interactions between flavor-singlet hadrons, as well as between nucleons and flavor-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>Ab initio lattice study of neutron-alpha scattering with chiral forces at N3LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio lattice calculation of neutron-alpha ($n$-$\alpha$) scattering using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with chiral interactions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). Building on the high-fidelity chiral Hamiltonian introduced in Ref. [1], we compute scattering phase shifts in the $S$- and $P$-wave channels using the L\"uscher finite-volume method. Our results demonstrate excellent agreement with empirical $R$-matrix phase shifts in the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ channels, while revealing persistent discrepancies in the $^2P_{1/2}$ channel for neutron energies above 5 MeV. To systematically investigate these discrepancies, we construct and analyze a simplified neutron-alpha toy model, demonstrating that these discrepancies are not due to the use of the L\"uscher finite-volume method. Additionally, we revisit our three-nucleon (3N) force fitting procedure, explicitly incorporating neutron-alpha scattering data through comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This analysis confirms the stability of nuclear binding-energy predictions and highlights the need for further refinements in the lattice N3LO three-nucleon forces to fully describe neutron-alpha scattering in the challenging ${}^2P_{1/2}$ channel.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>
