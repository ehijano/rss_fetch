      <title>LOGOS-CA: A Cellular Automaton Using Natural Language as State and Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics in the low-density phase of a two-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow</title>

Abstract: We analyze the structure and dynamics in the low-density phase of the deterministic two-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow introduced in [O. Biham, A.A. Middleton and D. Levine, Phys. Rev. A 46, R6124 (1992)]. The model consists of horizontally-oriented (H) cars that move to the right and vertically-oriented (V) cars that move downward, on a square lattice of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. Starting from a random initial state of density $p$, which is equally divided between the H and V-cars, the model exhibits a phase transition at a critical density $p_c$. For $p&lt;p_c$ it evolves toward a free-flowing periodic (FFP) state, while for $p&gt;p_c$ it evolves toward a fully-jammed state or to an intermediate state of congested traffic. In the FFP states, the H and V-cars segregate into homogeneous diagonal bands, in which they move freely without obstruction. To analyze the convergence toward the FFP states we introduce a configuration-space distance measure $D(t)=D_{\parallel}(t)+D_{\perp}(t)$ between the state of the system at time $t$ and the set of FFP states. The $D_{\parallel}(t)$ term accounts for the interactions between homotypic pairs of H (or V) cars, while $D_{\perp}(t)$ accounts for the interactions between heterotypic pairs of H and V-cars. We show that in the FFP states $D(t)=0$, while in all the other states $D(t)&gt;0$. As the system evolves toward the FFP states, there is a separation of time scales, where $D_{\parallel}(t)$ decays very fast while $D_{\perp}(t)$ decays much more slowly. Moreover, the time dependence of $D_{\perp}(t)$ is well fitted by an exponentially truncated power-law decay of the form $D_{\perp}(t)\sim t^{-\gamma} \exp(-t/\tau_{\perp})$, where $\tau_{\perp}$ depends on $L$ and $p$. The power-law decay suggests avalanche-like dynamics with no characteristic scale, while the exponential cutoff is imposed by the finite lattice size.</description>
