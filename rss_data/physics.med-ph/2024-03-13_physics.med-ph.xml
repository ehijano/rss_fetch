      <title>Advancing Hyperspectral Targeted Alpha Therapy with Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) has emerged as a promising modality for the treatment of various malignancies, leveraging the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short range of alpha particles to selectively irradiate cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Monitoring and optimizing TAT delivery is crucial for its clinical success. Hyper-spectral Single Photon Imaging (HSPI) presents a novel and versatile approach for the real-time assessment of TAT in vivo. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for HSPI in TAT, encompassing spectral unmixing, quantitative dosimetry, and spatiotemporal visualization. We report the development of a dedicated HSPI system tailored to alpha-emitting radionuclides, enabling the simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution spectral data and single-photon localization. Utilizing advanced spectral unmixing algorithms, we demonstrate the discrimination of alpha-induced scintillation from background fluorescence, facilitating precise alpha particle tracking with adversarial machine learning.</description>

      <title>Elliptical Halbach magnet and gradient modules for low-field portable MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. To develop methods to design the complete magnetic system for a truly portable MRI scanner for neurological and musculoskeletal (MSK) applications, optimized for field homogeneity, field of view (FoV) and gradient performance compared to existing low-weight configurations. Approach. We explore optimal elliptic-bore Halbach configurations based on discrete arrays of permanent magnets. In this way, we seek to improve the field homogeneity and remove constraints to the extent of the gradient coils typical of Halbach magnets. Specifically, we have optimized a tightly-packed distribution of magnetic Nd$_2$Fe$_14$B cubes with differential evolution algorithms, and a second array of shimming magnets with interior point and differential evolution methods. We have also designed and constructed an elliptical set of gradient coils that extend over the whole magnet length, maximizing the distance between the lobe centers. These are optimized with a target field method minimizing a cost function that considers also heat dissipation. Main result. We have employed the new toolbox to build the main magnet and gradient modules for a portable MRI scanner designed for point-of-care and residential use. The elliptical Halbach bore has semi-axes of 10 &amp; 14 cm and the magnet generates a field of 87 mT homogeneous down to 5,700 ppm (parts per million) in a 20 cm diameter FoV, it weighs 216 kg and has a width of 65 cm and a height of 72 cm. Gradient efficiencies go up to around 0.8 mT/m/A, for a maximum of 12 mT/m with in 0.5 ms with 15 A &amp; 15 V amplifier. The distance between lobes is 28 cm, significantly increased with respect to other Halbach-based scanners. Heat dissipation is around 25 W at maximum power, and gradient deviations from linearity are below 20% in a 20 cm sphere.</description>

      <title>A cascaded deep network for automated tumor detection and segmentation in clinical PET imaging of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from PET images has important implications for estimation of total metabolic tumor volume, radiomics analysis, surgical intervention and radiotherapy. Manual segmentation of tumors in whole-body PET images is time-consuming, labor-intensive and operator-dependent. In this work, we develop and validate a fast and efficient three-step cascaded deep learning model for automated detection and segmentation of DLBCL tumors from PET images. As compared to a single end-to-end network for segmentation of tumors in whole-body PET images, our three-step model is more effective (improves 3D Dice score from 58.9% to 78.1%) since each of its specialized modules, namely the slice classifier, the tumor detector and the tumor segmentor, can be trained independently to a high degree of skill to carry out a specific task, rather than a single network with suboptimal performance on overall segmentation.</description>

      <title>A slice classification neural network for automated classification of axial PET/CT slices from a multi-centric lymphoma dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated slice classification is clinically relevant since it can be incorporated into medical image segmentation workflows as a preprocessing step that would flag slices with a higher probability of containing tumors, thereby directing physicians attention to the important slices. In this work, we train a ResNet-18 network to classify axial slices of lymphoma PET/CT images (collected from two institutions) depending on whether the slice intercepted a tumor (positive slice) in the 3D image or if the slice did not (negative slice). Various instances of the network were trained on 2D axial datasets created in different ways: (i) slice-level split and (ii) patient-level split; inputs of different types were used: (i) only PET slices and (ii) concatenated PET and CT slices; and different training strategies were employed: (i) center-aware (CAW) and (ii) center-agnostic (CAG). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and various binary classification metrics. We observe and describe a performance overestimation in the case of slice-level split as compared to the patient-level split training. The model trained using patient-level split data with the network input containing only PET slices in the CAG training regime was the best performing/generalizing model on a majority of metrics. Our models were additionally more closely compared using the sensitivity metric on the positive slices from their respective test sets.</description>

      <title>Fast high-resolution metabolite mapping in the rat brain using 1H-FID-MRSI at 14.1T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) enables the simultaneous non-invasive acquisition of MR spectra from multiple spatial locations inside the brain. While 1H-MRSI is increasingly used in the human brain, it is not yet widely applied in the preclinical settings, mostly because of difficulties specifically related to very small nominal voxel size in the rodent brain and low concentration of brain metabolites, resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio SNR.
  In this context, we implemented a free induction decay 1H-MRSI sequence (1H-FID-MRSI) in the rat brain at 14.1T. We combined the advantages of 1H-FID-MRSI with the ultra-high magnetic field to achieve higher SNR, coverage and spatial resolution in the rodent brain, and developed a custom dedicated processing pipeline with a graphical user interface: MRS4Brain toolbox.
  LCModel fit, using the simulated metabolite basis-set and in-vivo measured MM, provided reliable fits for the data at acquisition delays of 1.3 and 0.94 ms. The resulting Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds were sufficiently low (&lt;30%) for eight metabolites of interest, leading to highly reproducible metabolic maps. Similar spectral quality and metabolic maps were obtained between 1 and 2 averages, with slightly better contrast and brain coverage due to increased SNR in the latter case. Furthermore, the obtained metabolic maps were accurate enough to confirm the previously known brain regional distribution of some metabolites. The acquisitions proved high reproducibility over time.
  We demonstrated that the increased SNR and spectral resolution at 14.1T can be translated into high spatial resolution in 1H-FID-MRSI of the rat brain in 13 minutes, using the sequence and processing pipeline described herein. High-resolution 1H-FID-MRSI at 14.1T provided reproducible and high-quality metabolic mapping of brain metabolites with significantly reduced technical limitations.</description>

      <title>Noise-based Correction for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction. Noisy measurements frequently cause noisy and inaccurate images in impedance imaging. No post-processing technique exists to calculate the propagation of measurement noise and use this to suppress noise in the image. Objectives. The objectives of this work were (1) to develop a post-processing method for noise-based correction (NBC) in impedance tomography, (2) to test whether NBC improves image quality in electrical impedance tomography (EIT), (3) to determine whether it is preferable to use correlated or uncorrelated noise for NBC, (4) to test whether NBC works with in vivo data and (5) to test whether NBC is stable across model and perturbation geometries. Methods. EIT was performed in silico in a 2D homogeneous circular domain and an anatomically realistic, heterogeneous 3D human head domain for four perturbations and 25 noise levels in each case. This was validated by performing EIT for four perturbations in a circular, saline tank in 2D as well as a human head-shaped saline tank with a realistic skull-like layer in 3D. Images were assessed on the weighted spatial variance (WSV) with respect to the target image. The effect of NBC was also tested for example in vivo EIT data of lung ventilation in a human thorax and cortical activity in a rat brain. Results. On visual inspection, NBC maintained or increased image quality for all perturbations and noise levels in 2D and 3D experimentally and in silico. Analysis of the WSV showed that NBC significantly improved the WSV in nearly all cases. When the WSV was inferior with NBC, this was either visually imperceptible or a transformation between noisy images. For in vivo data, NBC improved image quality in all cases and preserved the expected shape of the reconstructed perturbation. In practice, uncorrelated NBC performed better than correlated NBC and is recommended as a general-use post-processing technique in EIT.</description>

      <title>CheXmask: a large-scale dataset of anatomical segmentation masks for multi-center chest x-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of successful artificial intelligence models for chest X-ray analysis relies on large, diverse datasets with high-quality annotations. While several databases of chest X-ray images have been released, most include disease diagnosis labels but lack detailed pixel-level anatomical segmentation labels. To address this gap, we introduce an extensive chest X-ray multi-center segmentation dataset with uniform and fine-grain anatomical annotations for images coming from five well-known publicly available databases: ChestX-ray8, Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest, and VinDr-CXR, resulting in 657,566 segmentation masks. Our methodology utilizes the HybridGNet model to ensure consistent and high-quality segmentations across all datasets. Rigorous validation, including expert physician evaluation and automatic quality control, was conducted to validate the resulting masks. Additionally, we provide individualized quality indices per mask and an overall quality estimation per dataset. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community, streamlining the development and assessment of innovative methodologies in chest X-ray analysis. The CheXmask dataset is publicly available at: https://physionet.org/content/chexmask-cxr-segmentation-data/</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation for MRI Parallel Imaging Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) always suffers from long acquisition times. Parallel imaging (PI) is one solution to reduce scan time by periodically skipping certain K-space lines and then reconstructing high-quality images from undersampled measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a new deep learning method that represents an object as a continuous function of spatial coordinates, and this function is normally parameterized by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we propose a novel MRI PI reconstruction method based on INR, which represents the reconstructed fully-sampled images as the function of voxel coordinates and prior feature vectors of undersampled images to overcome the generalization problem of INR. Specifically, we introduce a scale-embedded encoder to produce scale-independent voxel-specific features from MR images with different undersampling scales and then concatenate with coordinate vectors to recover fully-sampled MR images, thus achieving multiple scale reconstructions. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by experimenting with publicly available MRI datasets and was compared with other reconstruction methods. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over alternative reconstruction methods.</description>
