      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Compound AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound AI Systems, integrating multiple interacting components like models, retrievers, and external tools, have emerged as essential for addressing complex AI tasks. However, current implementations suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to tight coupling between application logic and execution details, a disconnect between orchestration and resource management layers, and the perceived exclusiveness between efficiency and quality.
  We propose a vision for resource-efficient Compound AI Systems through a \emph{declarative workflow programming model} and an \emph{adaptive runtime system} for dynamic scheduling and resource-aware decision-making. Decoupling application logic from low-level details exposes levers for the runtime to flexibly configure the execution environment and resources, without compromising on quality. Enabling collaboration between the workflow orchestration and cluster manager enables higher efficiency through better scheduling and resource management.
  We are building a prototype system, called \textbf{\textit{Murakkab}}, to realize this vision. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates speedups up to $\sim 3.4\times$ in workflow completion times while delivering $\sim 4.5\times$ higher energy efficiency, showing promise in optimizing resources and advancing AI system design.</description>

      <title>On the Shape Containment Problem within the Amoebot Model with Reconfigurable Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In programmable matter, we consider a large number of tiny, primitive computational entities called particles that run distributed algorithms to control global properties of the particle structure. Shape formation problems, where the particles have to reorganize themselves into a desired shape using basic movement abilities, are particularly interesting. In the related shape containment problem, the particles are given the description of a shape $S$ and have to find maximally scaled representations of $S$ within the initial configuration, without movements. While the shape formation problem is being studied extensively, no attention has been given to the shape containment problem, which may have additional uses beside shape formation, such as detection of structural flaws.
  In this paper, we consider the shape containment problem within the geometric amoebot model for programmable matter, using its reconfigurable circuit extension to enable the instantaneous transmission of primitive signals on connected subsets of particles. We first prove a lower runtime bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ synchronous rounds for the general problem, where $n$ is the number of particles. Then, we construct the class of snowflake shapes and its subclass of star convex shapes, and present solutions for both. Let $k$ be the maximum scale of the considered shape in a given amoebot structure. If the shape is star convex, we solve it within $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 k)$ rounds. If it is a snowflake but not star convex, we solve it within $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ rounds.</description>

      <title>Measuring GPU utilization one level deeper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPU hardware is vastly underutilized. Even resource-intensive AI applications have diverse resource profiles that often leave parts of GPUs idle. While colocating applications can improve utilization, current spatial sharing systems lack performance guarantees. Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth. We propose a methodology to profile resource interference of GPU kernels across these dimensions and discuss how to build GPU schedulers that provide strict performance guarantees while colocating applications to minimize cost.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Decentralized Online Learning for Supervised Regression and Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning networks aim to synthesize a single network inference from a set of raw inferences provided by multiple participants. To determine the combined inference, these networks must adopt a mapping from historical participant performance to weights, and to appropriately incentivize contributions they must adopt a mapping from performance to fair rewards. Despite the increased prevalence of decentralized learning networks, there exists no systematic study that performs a calibration of the associated free parameters. Here we present an optimization framework for key parameters governing decentralized online learning in supervised regression and classification problems. These parameters include the slope of the mapping between historical performance and participant weight, the timeframe for performance evaluation, and the slope of the mapping between performance and rewards. These parameters are optimized using a suite of numerical experiments that mimic the design of the Allora Network, but have been extended to handle classification tasks in addition to regression tasks. This setup enables a comparative analysis of parameter tuning and network performance optimization (loss minimization) across both problem types. We demonstrate how the optimal performance-weight mapping, performance timeframe, and performance-reward mapping vary with network composition and problem type. Our findings provide valuable insights for the optimization of decentralized learning protocols, and we discuss how these results can be generalized to optimize any inference synthesis-based, decentralized AI network.</description>

      <title>Meta-Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Real-Time Traffic Flow Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic flow in urban environments presents a significant challenge, exacerbated by dynamic changes and the sheer volume of data generated by modern transportation networks. Traditional centralized traffic management systems often struggle with scalability and privacy concerns, hindering their effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) to create a decentralized, scalable, and adaptive traffic management system. Our approach, termed Meta-Federated Learning, leverages the distributed nature of FL to process data locally at the edge, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing latency. Simultaneously, ML enables the system to quickly adapt to new traffic conditions without the need for extensive retraining. We implement our model across a simulated network of smart traffic devices, demonstrating that Meta-Federated Learning significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and response time. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable adaptability to sudden changes in traffic patterns, suggesting a scalable solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities. This study not only paves the way for more resilient urban traffic systems but also exemplifies the potential of integrated FL and ML in other real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Programming tools for Analogue Quantum Computing in the High-Performance Computing Context -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way:
  Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities.
  Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration.
  Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Search by Scattered Agents in Dynamic Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of locating a black hole within a dynamic graph using a set of scattered agents, which start from arbitrary positions in the graph. A black hole is defined as a node that silently eliminates any agent that visits it, effectively modeling network failures such as a crashed host or a destructive virus. The black hole search problem is considered solved when at least one agent survives and possesses a complete map of the graph, including the precise location of the black hole.
  Our study focuses on the scenario where the underlying graph is a dynamic 1-interval connected ring: a ring graph where, in each round, one edge may be absent. Agents communicate with other agents using movable pebbles that can be placed on nodes. In this setting, we demonstrate that three agents are sufficient to identify the black hole in $O(n^2)$ moves. Furthermore, we prove that this number of agents is optimal. Additionally, we establish that the complexity bound is tight, requiring $\Omega(n^2)$ moves for any algorithm solving the problem with three agents, even when stronger communication mechanisms, such as unlimited-size whiteboards on nodes, are available.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Gradient-Free Methods for Stochastic Non-Smooth Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider decentralized gradient-free optimization of minimizing Lipschitz continuous functions that satisfy neither smoothness nor convexity assumption. We propose two novel gradient-free algorithms, the Decentralized Gradient-Free Method (DGFM) and its variant, the Decentralized Gradient-Free Method$^+$ (DGFM$^{+}$). Based on the techniques of randomized smoothing and gradient tracking, DGFM requires the computation of the zeroth-order oracle of a single sample in each iteration, making it less demanding in terms of computational resources for individual computing nodes. Theoretically, DGFM achieves a complexity of $\mathcal O(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\varepsilon ^{-4})$ for obtaining an $(\delta,\varepsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point. DGFM$^{+}$, an advanced version of DGFM, incorporates variance reduction to further improve the convergence behavior. It samples a mini-batch at each iteration and periodically draws a larger batch of data, which improves the complexity to $\mathcal O(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1} \varepsilon^{-3})$. Moreover, experimental results underscore the empirical advantages of our proposed algorithms when applied to real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Achieving Dimension-Free Communication in Federated Learning via Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaborative and privacy-preserving machine learning across distributed data sources. However, the substantial communication costs associated with FL significantly challenge its efficiency. Specifically, in each communication round, the communication costs scale linearly with the model's dimension, which presents a formidable obstacle, especially in large model scenarios. Despite various communication-efficient strategies, the intrinsic dimension-dependent communication cost remains a major bottleneck for current FL implementations. This paper proposes a novel dimension-free communication algorithm - DeComFL, which leverages the zeroth-order optimization techniques and reduces the communication cost from $\mathscr{O}(d)$ to $\mathscr{O}(1)$ by transmitting only a constant number of scalar values between clients and the server in each round, regardless of the dimension $d$ of the model parameters. Theoretically, in non-convex functions, we prove that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art rates, which show a linear speedup of the number of clients and local steps under standard assumptions. With additional low effective rank assumption, we can further show the convergence rate is independent of the model dimension $d$ as well. Empirical evaluations, encompassing both classic deep learning training and large language model fine-tuning, demonstrate significant reductions in communication overhead. Notably, DeComFL achieves this by transmitting only around 1MB of data in total between the server and a client to fine-tune a model with billions of parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZidongLiu/DeComFL.</description>

      <title>Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</description>
