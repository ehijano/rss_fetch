      <title>Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the N\'eel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Influence of atomic-scale defects on coherent phonon excitations by THz near fields in an STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent phonons describe the collective, ultrafast motion of atoms and play a central role in light-induced structural dynamics. Here, we employ terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) to excite and detect coherent phonons in semiconducting 2H-MoTe$_{2}$ and resolve how their excitation is influenced by atomic-scale defects. In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both forbidden in the bulk. Remarkably, the relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field. This defect-tunable coupling offers new opportunities to control material properties via selective excitation of vibrational modes at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic flat-band model constructed by molecular-orbital representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a tight-binding model that hosts both a quasi-periodic nature and marcoscopically-dengenerate zero-energy modes. The model can be regarded as a counterpart of the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, which is a paradigmatic example of the quasi-periodic tight-binding model. Our main focus is on the many-body state where the flat-band-like degenerate zero-energy modes are fully occupied. We find a characteristic sublattice dependence of the particle density distribution. Further, by analyzing the hyperuniformity of the particle density distribution, we find that it belongs to the class-I hyperuniform distribution, regardless of the model parameter. We also show that, upon changing the parameter, the finite-energy modes exhibit the same extended-to-localized transition as that for the original AAH model.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast interband transitions in nanoporous gold metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.</description>

      <title>Andreev spin qubit protected by Franck-Condon blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andreev levels localized in a weak link between two superconductors can trap a superconducting quasiparticle. If there is a spin-orbit coupling in the link, the spin of the quasiparticle couples to the Josephson current. This effect can be leveraged to control and readout the spin of the quasiparticle thus using it as a qubit. One of the factors limiting the performance of such an Andreev spin qubit is spin relaxation. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the relaxation lifetime can be enhanced by utilizing the coupling between the Andreev spin and the supercurrent in a transmon circuit. The coupling ensures that the flip of the quasiparticle spin can only happen if it is accompanied by the excitation of multiple plasmons, as dictated by the Frank-Condon principle. This blocks spin relaxation at temperatures small compared to plasmon energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conditional diffusion model has been developed to analyze intricate conductance fluctuations called universal conductance fluctuations or quantum fingerprints appearing in quantum transport phenomena. The model reconstructs impurity arrangements and quantum interference patterns in nanometals by using magnetoconductance data, providing a novel approach to analyze complex data based on machine learning. In addition, we visualize the attention weights in the model, which efficiently extract information on the non-local correlation of the electron wave functions, and the score functions, which represent the force fields in the wave-function space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of artificial triangular graphene quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phases of triangular graphene quantum
  dots (TGQDs) with zigzag edges using variational and quantum Monte
  Carlo methods. These systems serve as quantum simulators for
  bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a
  platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic
  phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge
  depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka
  ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
  performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs
  transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site
  radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at
  half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon
  single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases,
  contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal
  armchair geometries.</description>

      <title>Site-resolved magnon and triplon dynamics on a programmable quantum dot spin ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-particle dynamics in interacting systems in the presence of disorder challenges the notion of internal thermalization, but proves difficult to investigate theoretically for large particle numbers. Engineered quantum systems may offer a viable alternative, as witnessed in experimental demonstrations in a variety of physical platforms, each with its own capabilities and limitations. Semiconductor gate-defined quantum dot arrays are of particular interest since they offer both a direct mapping of their Hamiltonian to Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models and the in-situ tunability of (magnetic) interactions and onsite potentials. In this work, we use an array of germanium quantum dots to simulate the dynamics of both single-spin excitations (magnons) and two-spin excitations (triplons). We develop a methodology that combines digital spin qubit operations for state preparation and readout with analog evolution under the full system Hamiltonian. Using these techniques, we can reconstruct quantum walk plots for both magnons and triplons, and for various configurations of Heisenberg exchange couplings. We furthermore explore the effect of single-site disorder and its impact on the propagation of spin excitations. The obtained results can provide a basis for simulating disorder-based solid-state phenomena such as many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Frequency as a Clock: Synchronization and Intrinsic Recovery in Graphene Transistor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon- and magnon-mediated decoherence of a magnonic qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decoherence of magnonic qubits in small ferromagnetic insulators and compute the relaxation and dephasing rates due to magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. We combine a Bloch--Redfield description with Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory to find explicit expressions for the rates. For a quadratic dispersion and assuming a uniform mode defines the qubit, we find that decay into two phonons is the only allowed relaxation process at zero temperature. The low resonance frequency and heavy unit cell strongly suppress this process in yttrium-iron-garnet. We also find that the dephasing rate scales with the inverse of size and damping of the magnet, and could become large for small and clean magnets. Our calculation thus provides additional insight into the viability of magnon-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of the topological obstruction in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) results from the Coulomb interactions of electrons in flat bands of non-trivial topology. While the bands' dispersion is well characterized, accessing their topology remains an experimental challenge. Recent measurements established the local density of states (LDOS) as a topological observable. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the LDOS of TBG near a defect. We observe characteristic patterns resulting from the Dirac cones having the same chirality within a moir\'e valley. At higher energies, we observe the Lifshitz transition associated with the Dirac cones mixing. Our measurements provide a full characterization of TBG's band structure, confirming the main features of the continuum model including the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, the role of emergent symmetries and the topological obstruction of the wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Domain Switching on the Pareto Front: Multi-Objective Deep Kernel Learning in Automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Emblems of pair density waves: dual identity of topological defects and their transport signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair density wave (PDW) exemplifies intertwined orders in strongly correlated systems. A recent discovery of superconductivity in a quarter-metal state offers the first experimental system where a pure PDW without uniform superconductivity is suspected, offering a unique opportunity to examine the consequences of intertwined orders. A pure two-dimensional PDW supports an unusual fractional excitation as its topological defect (TD). A TD simultaneously winds the phase of the Cooper pair and distorts the amplitude modulation -- a dual role reflecting its intertwined character. As a vortex, a TD carries fractional vorticity of $\frac{1}{3} h/2e$, whose movement would cause resistance. As a crystalline defect, a TD can be sourced by charge disorder in the system. We show that experimentally observed resistive switching can originate from mobile TDs, while a small magnetic field will restore zero resistance by blocking their motion. The resulting resistive state exhibits extreme anisotropy and a Hall response, with the Hall angle determined by the angle between the current and the TD's Burgers vector. These features will serve as confirmation of the dual identity of topological defects as emblems of PDW order.</description>

      <title>Defect complexes in CrSBr revealed through electron microscopy and deep learning</title>

Abstract: Atomic defects underpin the properties of van der Waals materials, and their understanding is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for defect identification in atomically thin materials, and extending it to multilayer and beam-sensitive materials would accelerate their exploration. Here we establish a comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D semiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and ab-initio calculations. We apply a custom-developed machine learning work flow to detect, classify and average point vacancy defects. This classification enables us to uncover several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes and lines of vacancy defects that extend over many unit cells. We show that their occurrence is in agreement with our computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing layer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr. Our ab-initio calculations show that the interstitial defect complexes give rise to highly localized electronic states. These states are of particular interest due to the reduced electronic dimensionality and magnetic properties of CrSBr and are furthermore predicted to be optically active. Our results broaden the scope of defect studies in challenging materials and reveal new defect types in bilayer CrSBr that can be extrapolated to the bulk and to over 20 materials belonging to the same FeOCl structural family.</description>

      <title>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</description>

      <title>Heat Dissipation and Thermoelectric Performance of InSe-Based Monolayers: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulations of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we study transient heat transfer in five indium-based two-dimensional monolayers: Janus monolayers In$_2$SeTe and In$_2$SSe, pristine InSe, and InSe under 4$\%$ and 6$\%$ tensile strain. In this work, the potential of these materials for energy conversion in thermoelectric generators and hotspot control in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors is investigated. A promising option for an effective heat dissipation and enhanced transistor reliability is found to be a strained InSe, which shows the lowest peak temperature during the heating among the studied materials. On the other hand, with a high Seebeck coefficient, low thermal conductivity, and an improved figure of merit, the Janus In$_2$SeTe monolayer, compensates for its increased phonon scattering to reach the maximum temperature, making it a potent thermoelectric material. Our findings emphasis the importance of strain engineering and structural asymmetry in tuning phonon transport, enabling material optimization for next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Spatial Multigraph Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a popular paradoxical exercise to show that the infinite sum of positive integer numbers is equal to -1/12, sometimes called the Ramanujan sum. Here we propose a qualitative approach, much like that of a physicist, to show how the value -1/12 can make sense and, in fact, appears in certain physical quantities where this type of summation is involved. At the light of two physical examples, taken respectively from condensed matter -- the Landau diamagnetism -- and quantum electrodynamics -- the Casimir effect -- that illustrate this strange sum, we present a systematic way to extract this Ramanujan term from the infinity.</description>

      <title>Gate Tunable Room-temperature Mott Insulator in Kagome compound Nb3Cl8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</description>

      <title>Atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures and magnetic states in an anisotropic layered ferromagnet FePd2Te2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have predominantly exhibited easy-axis or easy-plane anisotropy and display a high sensitivity to the underlying crystal structure and lattice symmetry. Recently, an in-plane anisotropic 2D ferromagnet of FePd2Te2 has been discovered with intriguing structure and quasi-one-dimensional spin system. Here, we report a real-space investigation of its twinning structure and magnetic states using atomic/magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The atomic to mesoscale hierarchical structures with the orthogonal and corrugated compressive /tensile(C/T) regions are directly observed due to the intrinsic twinning-domain characteristic. The structure-related intact ferromagnetic (FM), field-induced polarized-FM states and their transitions are comparatively discussed at the mesoscale with the corresponding macroscopic magnetic measurements. Temperature- and field-dependent evolution of magnetic phase are further investigated at the FM and PM states, and summarized to obtain a unique H-T phase diagram of FePd2Te2. Our work provides key results for understanding the complicated magnetic properties of FePd2Te2, and suggests new directions for manipulating magnetic states through the atomic and mesoscale structure engineering.</description>

      <title>Imaging the indirect-to-direct band-gap crossover in PbI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the band-gap in PbI2 (i.e. direct or indirect) is crucial for its applications. Here we directly image, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, its thickness-dependent crossover from an indirect to a direct band-gap. We experimentally probe a large shift of the valence band maximum towards the center of the Brillouin zone, when the thickness of PbI2 films is greater than a monolayer. Our experimental results, accompanied by density functional theory calculations, suggest that the band-gap crossover is driven by interlayer interactions and the hybridization of iodine pz orbitals. These findings demonstrate the tunable electronic properties of PbI2, highlighting its potential for applications in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Two-dimensional Electron Gases with Magnetic Doping and Proximity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of magnetic two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces has provided new opportunities in the field of spintronics. The enhancement of magnetism in 2DEGs at oxide interfaces continues to be a significant challenge, as exemplified by the relatively weak magnetism observed in the classical LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Here, we present ferromagnetic (FM) 2DEGs at the interface fabricated between the FM insulator EuTiO3 (ETO) and the strong spin-orbit coupled (SOC) perovskite insulator KTaO3 (KTO). With the combined effects of magnetic atom doping and magnetic proximity from ETO films, the coercive field of 2DEGs can be significantly enhanced. Magnetoresistance (MR) curve with a high coercive field of 1000 Oe has been observed, in conjunction with a temperature-dependent unambiguous hysteresis loop in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Furthermore, within the 2DEGs, we have identified a synergetic interplay between magnetic scattering and the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect on transport. This study provides fresh insights into the formation of FM 2DEGs at ETO/KTO interfaces, and introduce an innovative pathway for creating high-performance magnetic 2DEGs at oxide interfaces.</description>

      <title>YSR Bond Qubit in a Double Quantum Dot with cQED Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads. Defining a qubit using these singlet parity bonding states provides dot charge noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates, and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect (SHE) and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect offer potential for magnetization manipulation. However, deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets via SOTs requires a strong symmetry-breaking perturbation, typically an external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate that field-free SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization can be facilitated with the assistance of the orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd bilayer SOT device, we find that while the planar Hall effect (PHE) generates a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque, representing a lateral symmetry breaking, the SHE-induced torque achievable at practical current density is insufficient to switch the perpendicular magnetization. Incorporating a Mo underlayer and exploiting its strong OHE can amplify the in-plane damping-like torque via orbital-to-spin conversion, enabling efficient field-free deterministic switching without complex device geometries or low symmetric spin sources, providing a straightforward and scalable strategy for achieving high-speed and low-power spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unified model for non-Abelian braiding of Majorana and Dirac fermion zero modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are the most intensively studied non-Abelian anyons. The Dirac fermion zero modes in topological insulators, which are symmetry-protected doubling of MZMs under fermion number conservation, offer an alternative approach to explore non-Abelian anyons. However, a unified model that elucidates the braiding statistics of these types of topological zero modes remains absent. We show that the minimal Kitaev chain model beyond fine-tuning regime provides a unified characterization of the non-Abelian statistics of both MZMs and Dirac fermion zero modes in different parameter regimes. In particular, we introduce a minimal tri-junction setting based on the minimal Kitaev chain model and show it facilitates the unified scheme of braiding Dirac fermion zero modes, as well as the MZMs in the assistance of a Dirac mode. This unified minimal model provides deeper insights into non-Abelian statistics, demonstrating that the non-Abelian braiding of MZMs can be continuously extended to encompass Dirac fermion zero modes. The minimal Kitaev chain has been realized in coupled quantum dots [Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. Our extension, which demonstrates novel nontrivial phases with non-Abelian MZM pairs and Dirac zero modes emerging in the broader parameter regimes without fine-tuning, expands the accessible experimental parameter space and enhances the feasibility of observing non-Abelian statistics in the minimal Kitaev chain model.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Edge states and persistent current in a PT-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with generic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model by including next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction and balanced loss-gain(BLG), and subjecting the whole system to an external uniform magnetic field. We study the band structure, edge states and persistent current in this extended SSH model under General Boundary Condition(GBC) of which the periodic, anti-periodic and open boundary conditions appear as special cases. It is shown that the point bandgap decreases with the increasing value of the strength of the NNN interaction and vanish beyond a critical value. Further, the line gap exhibits closed-loop like structures for non-vanishing NNN interaction under the Periodic Boundary Condition(PBC). The Zak phase receives no contribution from the NNN interaction under the PBC. We show that the NNN interaction has no effect on the persistent current in the half-filled limit for the case of PBC. We show that the model without the NNN interaction is exactly solvable for a class of GBC of which PBC, anti-periodic boundary condition(APBC) and anti-hermitian boundary condition(AHBC) arise as special cases. We obtain analytic expressions for the edge states in the case of Open Boundary Condition(OBC) and AHBC for vanishing NNN interaction. We show numerically for OBC that edge states in the topologically trivial phase appear for non-vanishing NNN interaction in the parametric regions where PT-symmetry is broken under PBC. In the topologically non-trivial phase, the edge states under OBC exists only up to a critical value of the NNN strength and vanishes beyond a critical value. The bulk-boundary correspondence(BBC) for unbroken PT-phase is similar to hermitian SSH model, while non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) is observed for broken PT-phase.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference on the surface of Bi$_{\mathbf{2}}$Se$_{\mathbf{3}}$ terminated (PbSe)$_{\mathbf 5}$(Bi$_{\mathbf 2}$Se$_{\mathbf 3}$)$_{\mathbf 6}$</title>

Abstract: Among the family of topological superconductors derived from {\BiSe}, $\mathrm{Cu}_x(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ is unique in its surface termination of a single quintuple layer (QL) of the topological insulator (TI) \BiSe{} on an ordinary insulator PbSe. Here, we report a combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) characterization of the cleaved surface of the parent compound $(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (PSBS). Interestingly, the potential disorder due to the random distribution of native defects is only $\Gamma \sim 4~\mathrm{meV}$, comparable to the smallest reported for TIs. Performing high-resolution quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) near the Fermi energy ($E-E_\mathrm{F} = -1~\mathrm{eV}~\mathrm{to}~0.6~\mathrm{eV}$) we reconstruct the dispersion relation of the dominant spectral feature and our ab initio calculations show that this surface feature originates from two bands with Rashba-like splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking. Moreover, only a small hexagonal distortion of the calculated Fermi surface is seen in the full momentum space distribution of the measured scattering data. Nevertheless, the scattering pattern at lower energies transforms into a flower-like shape with suppressed intensity along the $\overline{\Gamma \mathrm{K}}$ direction. We show that this effect is not due to the forbidden backscattering in the spin-momentum locked surface state in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ but reflects the threefold symmetry of the scattering potential.</description>

      <title>Tunable Band Inversion in Trilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Displacement field control of elecronic bands in low-dimensional systems is a promising route toward engineering emergent quantum phases. Here, we report displacement-field-induced band inversion and modulation of the Berry phase of low-energy quasi particles in high-mobility Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). Using quantum oscillations, we track the evolution of the Fermi surface and topological properties of Dirac-like gully bands that emerge under a finite interlayer potential. We observe a striking sequence of transitions: at low displacement field $D$, the gullies are characterized by a Berry phase of $2\pi$ and large effective mass, indicating massive fermions. As $D$ increases, the Berry phase abruptly shifts to $\pi$ and the effective mass reaches a minimum, signaling the onset of massless Dirac behavior. At higher $D$, the Berry phase returns to $2\pi$, and the effective mass increases again, consistent with a band inversion. These findings demonstrate a rare, reversible topological phase transition - massive to massless to massive - driven entirely by an external displacement field. Despite robust theoretical predictions [\textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 085424 (2013), \textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{87}, 115422 (2013), and \textit{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{101}, 245411 (2020)], this evolution of the band topology had escaped experimental detection. Our results establish TLG as a tunable platform for nanoscale control of band topology. They establish a means to tune between massive and Dirac-like dispersions dynamically providing a foundation for exploring field-switchable topological phenomena in layered 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi energy sensitive universal conductance fluctuations in anisotropic materials</title>

Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</description>

      <title>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and benefit from favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. The required coupling to an ancillary control qubit, however, can negate these benefits by inducing highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. An important question is thus whether a cavity-qubit coupling can be realized that offers readout and control capabilities without spoiling the cavity. Here, motivated by its long lifetime and design flexibility of its Hamiltonian, we experimentally investigate the fluxonium as a control qubit for superconducting cavities. We couple a fluxonium qubit to a superconducting resonator in the strong-dispersive regime and use it to measure the coherence and inherited nonlinearities of the resonator. We then demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions, with fidelities limited by resonator decay in our planar prototype device. Finally, we use the predictability of the resonator's inherited nonlinearities to show numerically that the fluxonium can reach cavity-coupling regimes that eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.</description>
