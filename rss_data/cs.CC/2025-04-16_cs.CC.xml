      <title>A Pseudorandom Generator for Functions of Low-Degree Polynomial Threshold Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing explicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for prominent categories of Boolean functions is a key focus in computational complexity theory. In this paper, we investigate the PRGs against the functions of degree-$d$ polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) over Gaussian space. Our main result is an explicit construction of PRG with seed length $\mathrm{poly}(k,d,1/\epsilon)\cdot\log n$ that can fool any function of $k$ degree-$d$ PTFs with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$. More specifically, we show that the summation of $L$ independent $R$-moment-matching Gaussian vectors $\epsilon$-fools functions of $k$ degree-$d$ PTFs, where $L=\mathrm{poly}( k, d, \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and $R = O({\log \frac{kd}{\epsilon}})$. The PRG is then obtained by applying an appropriate discretization to Gaussian vectors with bounded independence.</description>

      <title>Circuit metaconstruction in logspace for Rice-like complexity lower bounds in ANs and SGRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new proof technique combining finite model theory and dynamical systems has recently been introduced to obtain general complexity lower bounds on any question one may formulate on the dynamics (seen as a graph) of a given automata network (AN). ANs are abstract finite dynamical systems of interacting entities whose evolution rules are encoded as circuits, hence the study also applies to succinct graph representations (SGRs). In this article, we detail the construction of circuits to obtain general complexity lower bounds (metareduction) and show that the reduction is feasible in logarithmic space.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen' by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where $d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem by supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as a barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our application of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.</description>

      <title>On the Rational Degree of Boolean Functions and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a natural complexity measure of Boolean functions known as the rational degree. Denoted $\textrm{rdeg}(f)$, it is the minimal degree of a rational function that is equal to $f$ on the Boolean hypercube. For total functions $f$, it is conjectured that $\textrm{rdeg}(f)$ is polynomially related to the Fourier degree of $f$, $\textrm{deg}(f)$. Towards this conjecture, we show that:
  - Symmetric functions have rational degree at least $\Omega(\textrm{deg}(f))$ and unate functions have rational degree at least $\sqrt{\textrm{deg}(f)}$. We observe that both of these lower bounds are asymptotically tight.
  - Read-once AC and TC formulae have rational degree at least $\Omega(\sqrt{\textrm{deg}(f)})$. If these formulae contain parity gates, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(\textrm{deg}(f)^{1/2d})$, where $d$ is the depth.
  - Almost every Boolean function on $n$ variables has rational degree at least $n/2 - O(\sqrt{n})$.
  In contrast, we exhibit partial functions that witness unbounded separations between rational and approximate degree, in both directions. As a consequence, we show that for quantum computers, post-selection and bounded-error are incomparable resources in the black-box model.
  In addition, we show AND and OR composition lemmas for the rational degree and exhibit new polynomial separations between the rational degree and other well-studied complexity measures, such as sensitivity and spectral sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Multicut Problems in Embedded Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity on the Demand Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multicut problem asks for a minimum cut separating certain pairs of vertices: formally, given a graph $G$ and demand graph $H$ on a set $T\subseteq V(G)$ of terminals, the task is to find a minimum-weight set $C$ of edges of $G$ such that whenever two vertices of $T$ are adjacent in $H$, they are in different components of $G\setminus C$. Colin de Verdi\`{e}re [Algorithmica, 2017] showed that Multicut with $t$ terminals on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ can be solved in time $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$. Cohen-Addad et al. [JACM, 2021] proved a matching lower bound showing that the exponent of $n$ is essentially best possible (for every fixed value of $t$ and $g$), even in the special case of Multiway Cut, where the demand graph $H$ is a complete graph.
  However, this lower bound tells us nothing about other special cases of Multicut such as Group 3-Terminal Cut (where three groups of terminals need to be separated from each other). We show that if the demand pattern is, in some sense, close to being a complete bipartite graph, then Multicut can be solved faster than $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$, and furthermore this is the only property that allows such an improvement. Formally, for a class $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ is the special case where the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. For every fixed class $\mathcal{H}$ (satisfying some mild closure property), fixed $g$, and fixed $t$, our main result gives tight upper and lower bounds on the exponent of $n$ in algorithms solving Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$.</description>

      <title>Trading Determinism for Time: The k-Reach Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kallampally and Tewari showed in 2016 that there can be a trade-off between determinism and time in space-bounded computations. This they did by describing an unambiguous non-deterministic algorithm to solve Directed Graph Reachability that requires O(log^2 n) space and simultaneously runs in polynomial time. Savitch's 1970 algorithm that solves the same problem deterministically also requires O(log^2 n) space but doesn't guarantee polynomial running time and hence the trade off. We describe a new problem for which we can show a similar trade off between determinism and time.
  We consider a collection P of f directed paths. We show that the problem of finding reachability from one vertex to another in the union G of these path graphs via a path that switches amongst the paths in P at most k times can be solved in O(klog f+log n) space but the algorithm doesn't guarantee polynomial runtime. On the other hand, we also show that the same problem can be solved by an unambiguous non-deterministic algorithm that simultaneously runs in O(klog f+log n) space and polynomial time. Since these two algorithms are not dependent on Savitch, therefore this example sheds new light on how such a trade off between determinism and time happens in space-bounded computations and makes the phenomenon less elusive.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Geophylogenies -- Internal and External Labeling with Phylogenetic Tree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geophylogeny is a phylogenetic tree (or dendrogram) where each leaf (e.g. biological taxon) has an associated geographic location (site). To clearly visualize a geophylogeny, the tree is typically represented as a crossing-free drawing next to a map. The correspondence between the taxa and the sites is either shown with matching labels on the map (internal labeling) or with leaders that connect each site to the corresponding leaf of the tree (external labeling). In both cases, a good order of the leaves is paramount for understanding the association between sites and taxa. We define several quality measures for internal labeling and give an efficient algorithm for optimizing them. In contrast, minimizing the number of leader crossings in an external labeling is NP-hard. On the positive side, we show that crossing-free instances can be solved in polynomial time and give a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm. Furthermore, optimal solutions can be found in a matter of seconds on realistic instances using integer linear programming. Finally, we provide several efficient heuristic algorithms and experimentally show them to be near optimal on real-world and synthetic instances.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Min-Max Optimization with Lazy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies second-order methods for convex-concave minimax optimization. Monteiro and Svaiter (2012) proposed a method to solve the problem with an optimal iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ to find an $\epsilon$-saddle point. However, it is unclear whether the computational complexity, $\mathcal{O}((N+ d^2) d \epsilon^{-2/3})$, can be improved. In the above, we follow Doikov et al. (2023) and assume the complexity of obtaining a first-order oracle as $N$ and the complexity of obtaining a second-order oracle as $dN$. In this paper, we show that the computation cost can be reduced by reusing Hessian across iterations. Our methods take the overall computational complexity of $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}}( (N+d^2)(d+ d^{2/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}))$, which improves those of previous methods by a factor of $d^{1/3}$. Furthermore, we generalize our method to strongly-convex-strongly-concave minimax problems and establish the complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((N+d^2) (d + d^{2/3} \kappa^{2/3}) )$ when the condition number of the problem is $\kappa$, enjoying a similar speedup upon the state-of-the-art method. Numerical experiments on both real and synthetic datasets also verify the efficiency of our method.</description>
