      <title>The walled Brauer category and stable cohomology of $\mathrm{IA}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IA-automorphism group is the group of automorphisms of the free group $F_n$ that act trivially on the abelianization $F_n^{\mathrm{ab}}$. This group is in many ways analoguous to Torelli groups of surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues. In recent work, the stable rational cohomology of such groups was studied by Kupers and Randal-Williams, using the machinery of so-called Brauer categories. In this paper, we adapt their methods to study the stable rational cohomology of the IA-automorphism group. We obtain a conjectural description of the algebraic part of the stable rational cohomology and prove that it holds up to degree $Q+1$, given the assumption that the stable cohomology groups are stably finite dimensional in degrees up to $Q$. In particular, this allows us to compute the algebraic part of the stable cohomology in degree 2, which we show agrees with the part generated by the first cohomology group via the cup product map and which has previously been computed by Pettet.
  In the appendix, written by Mai Katada, it is shown how the results of the paper can be applied to compute the stable Albanese (co)homology of the IA-automorphism group.</description>

      <title>On the 576-fold periodicity of the spectrum SQFT: The proof of the lower bound via the Anderson duality pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are aimed at giving a differential geometric, and accordingly physical, explanation of the 576-periodicity of TMF. In this paper, we settle the problem of giving the lower bound 576. We formulate the problem as follows: we assume a spectrum $\mathrm{SQFT}$ with some conditions, suggest from physical considerations about the classifying spectrum for two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$-supersymmetric quantum field theories, and show that the periodicity of $\mathrm{SQFT}$ is no less than 576. The main tool for the proof is the analogue of the Anderson duality pairing introduced by the second-named author and Tachikawa. We do not rely on the Segal-Stolz-Teichner conjecture, so in particular we do not use any comparison map with TMF.</description>

      <title>Box Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new framework that unifies the filtration and mapper approaches from TDA, and present efficient algorithms to compute it. Termed the box filtration of a PCD, we grow boxes (hyperrectangles) that are not necessarily centered at each point (in place of balls centered at points). We grow the boxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the distribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point cover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that works with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either setting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence diagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers satisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using boxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher order intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same.
  Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that optimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of including more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in $O(m|U(0)|\log(mn\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments considered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover ($\leq$ number of points), $\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box dimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and $q = n \times |X|$. We demonstrate through multiple examples that the box filtration can produce more accurate results to summarize the topology of the PCD than VR and distance-to-measure (DTM) filtrations. Software for our implementation is available at https://github.com/pragup/Box-Filteration.</description>

      <title>Sequential parametrized topological complexity of group epimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the sequential parametrized topological complexity of group epimorphisms, which generalizes the sequential topological complexity of groups. We derive bounds for sequential parametrized topological complexity based on the cohomological dimension of certain subgroups, thereby extending the corresponding bounds for sequential topological complexity of groups. Finally, we utilize these results to provide alternative computations for the sequential parametrized topological complexity of planar Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations.</description>

      <title>Whitehead aspherical conjecture via ribbon sphere-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whitehead aspherical conjecture says that every connected subcomplex of every aspherical 2-complex is aspherical. By an argument on ribbon sphere-links, it is confirmed that the conjecture is true for every contractible finite 2-complex. In this paper, by generalizing this argument, this conjecture is confirmed to be true for every aspherical 2-complex.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper takes an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. The axioms have simple and natural motivations, and lead to the deeper connections between homotopy and homology.</description>
