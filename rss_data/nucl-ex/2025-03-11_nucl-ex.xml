      <title>Novel concept for low-energy antineutron production and its application for antineutron scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive data of antiproton scattering cross sections with protons and nuclei have advanced our understanding of hadronic interactions with antinucleons. However, low-energy antineutron scattering data are scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleus interactions. We present a novel production scheme of extremely low-energy antineutrons that could remedy this situation. This method is based on backward charge-exchange reaction ($p\bar{p}\to n\bar{n}$), and can reach the lowest momentum of 9 MeV/c, which would be well suited to study of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon or antinucleon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing jet anisotropies with cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quark-gluon plasma (QGP) forms, hadron production is anisotropic at both low and high transverse momentum, driven by flow dynamics and spatial anisotropies. To better understand these mechanisms, we use multi-particle correlations to reconstruct jet anisotropies. We simulate data using TennGen as a hydro-like background and combine it with PYTHIA-generated jets, clustering them with the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm. Jet anisotropies are unfolded using a Bayesian technique, ensuring the robustness of the reconstructed signals. Our results demonstrate that multi-particle cumulant methods can accurately capture the differential jet azimuthal anisotropies, providing crucial insights into high-$p_{T}$ behavior and the dynamics within heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Study of deeply virtual Compton scattering at the future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the impact of future measurements of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) with the ePIC detector at the electron-ion collider (EIC), currently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The considered process is sensitive to generalized parton distributions (GPDs), the understanding of which is a cornerstone of the EIC physics programme. Our study marks a milestone in the preparation of DVCS measurements at EIC and provides a reference point for future analyses. In addition to presenting distributions of basic kinematic variables obtained with the latest ePIC design and simulation software, we examine the impact of future measurements on the understanding of nucleon tomography and DVCS Compton form factors, which are directly linked to GPDs. We also assess the impact of radiative corrections and background contribution arising from exclusive $\pi^0$ production.</description>

      <title>Hadron Structure: Perspective and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) -- the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model. Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with constituent-like masses. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches the role played by EHM in shaping hadron electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, exciting nucleon resonances, and moulding hadron parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Single-Ended Event Reconstruction in PROSPECT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>

      <title>Deuterium-deuterium fusion charged particle detection using CR-39 and Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors are widely used in fusion research for detecting charged particles produced in fusion reactions. However, analyzing increasingly complex and large-scale CR-39 track images to extract meaningful information can be a tedious and time-consuming process, often prone to human errors and bias. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-based classification model capable of differentiating protons, tritons, and helions produced during D-D fusion, using CR-39 track images as input data. The CR-39 track images were processed and used to train a deep learning model. By preprocessing the track images for noise reduction and feature enhancement, we trained the YOLOv8 [1][2] network to distinguish the three particle types with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of over 96%, demonstrating its potential for improving automated track analysis in CR-39 detectors. Additionally, the model precisely identifies particle coordinates and counts, enabling comprehensive particle analysis. This study highlights the application of AI in track detection and classification, offering a robust solution for particle identification in CR-39 detector-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions of ground state mesons composed of $c$ or $b$ quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The valence quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of all ground state heavy mesons that composed of $b$ or $c$ quarks, are discussed; namely, the pseudoscalar $\eta_c(1S)$, $\eta_b(1S)$ and $B_c$, together with the corresponding vector ones, $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $B_c^\ast$. We use a QCD-inspired constituent quark model, which has been applied with success to conventional heavy mesons, so that one advantage here is that all parameters have already been fixed by previous studies. The wave functions of the heavy mesons in the rest frame are obtained by solving the Schr\"odinger equation, then boosted to its light-front based on Susskind's Lorentz transformation. The PDFs at the hadron scale, are then obtained by integrating out the transverse momenta of the modulus square of the light-front wave function. Our study shows how the valence quark distributions differ between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, as well as among charmonia, bottomonia and bottom-charmed mesons. Comparisons with other theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDFs obtained herein are in general narrower but align well with the expected patterns. Moreover, each PDF's point-wise behavior is squeezed with respect to the scale-free parton-like PDF.</description>

      <title>Role of the isovector spin-orbit potential in mitigating the CREX-PREX dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneering electroweak measurements of the neutron skin thickness in lead-208 and calcium-48 are challenging our understanding of nuclear dynamics. Many theoretical models suggest that the slope of the symmetry energy controls the development of a neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei. This led to the expectation that if lead-208 exhibits a large neutron skin, calcium-48 should as well. Given that the PREX collaboration reported a relatively thick neutron skin in lead, we anticipated that calcium would also have a significant neutron skin. Instead, the CREX collaboration reported a thin neutron skin in calcium. Although many suggestions have been proposed, the ``CREX-PREX dilemma" remains unsolved. Recently, an intriguing scenario has emerged, suggesting that an enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction could simultaneously account for both results. Following this approach, we performed relativistic mean-field calculations with an increased isovector spin-orbit potential. Our findings indicate that while this modification significantly affects the structure of calcium-48, it has only a marginal impact on lead-208, thereby bringing the results into better agreement with experiment. However, the strong enhancement required to mitigate the CREX-PREX dilemma destroys the agreement with a successful spin-orbit phenomenology, primarily by modifying the well-known ordering of spin-orbit partners.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), i.e. the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, we show that the low-momentum $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel analysis of the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of nucleon-antinucleon bound states has been studied for decades. We investigate the $e^+e^-\to p\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-\to n\bar{n}$ cross sections in the nonrelativistic effective field theory framework. The proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron coupled-channel final state interactions are considered and found responsible for near-threshold enhancements. Both the proton-neutron mass difference and the Coulomb interaction between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ are considered, and the $N\bar{N}$ strong interactions are taken into account through a short-distance optical potential. By fitting the low energy constants in the amplitudes to the data for the near-threshold $e^+e^-\to N\bar{N}$ cross sections from the BESIII and SND Collaborations, a $N\bar{N}$ quasi-bound state is found just above the $p\bar{p}$ threshold, and another $N\bar{N}$ pole is found on the unphysical Riemann sheet, farther away from the threshold. The constructed coupled-channel amplitude with Coulomb effects also offers a framework that can be used directly in experimental analyses on fine structures near the $N\bar{N}$ thresholds.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level), and central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutron cross-talk between organic scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of measurements have been performed with low-energy monoenergetic neutrons to characterise cross-talk between two organic scintillator detectors. Cross-talk time-of-flight spectra and probabilities were determined for neutron energies from 1.4 to 15.5 MeV and effective scattering angles ranging from $\sim$50{\deg} to $\sim$100{\deg}. Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating both the active and inactive materials making up the detectors showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. Whilst the time-of-flight spectra were very well reproduced, the cross-talk probabilities were only in approximate agreement with the measurements, with the most significant discrepancies ($\sim$40 %) occurring at the lowest energies. The neutron interaction processes producing cross-talk at the energies explored here are discussed in the light of these results.</description>
