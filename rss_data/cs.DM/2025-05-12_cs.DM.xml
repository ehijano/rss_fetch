      <title>Minimal $L^p$-congestion spanning trees on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the notion of spanning tree congestion for weighted graphs is introduced. The $L^p$ congestion of a spanning tree is defined as the $L^p$ norm of the edge congestion of that tree. In this context, the classical congestion is the $L^\infty$-congestion. Explicit estimations of the minimal spanning tree $L^p$ congestion for some families of graphs are given. In addition, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the minimal $L^p$-congestion spanning tree in any weighted graph and another two similar algorithms for weighted planar graphs. The performance of these algorithms is tested in several graphs.</description>

      <title>Scheduled Jacobian Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the efficient computation of Jacobian matrices for programs composed of sequential differentiable subprograms. By representing the overall Jacobian as a chain product of the Jacobians of these subprograms, we reduce the problem to optimizing the sequence of matrix multiplications, known as the Jacobian Matrix Chain Product problem. Solutions to this problem yield "optimal bracketings", which induce a precedence-constraint scheduling problem. We investigate the inherent parallelism in the solutions and develop a new dynamic programming algorithm as a heuristic that incorporates the scheduling. To assess its performance, we benchmark it against the global optimum, which is computed via a branch-and-bound algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Approximation Algorithm for Complete Interval Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As shown by Robertson and Seymour, deciding whether the complete graph $K_t$ is a minor of an input graph $G$ is a fixed parameter tractable problem when parameterized by $t$. From the approximation viewpoint, the gap to fill is quite large, as there is no PTAS for finding the largest complete minor unless $P = NP$, whereas a polytime $O(\sqrt n)$-approximation algorithm was given by Alon, Lingas and Wahl\'en.
  We investigate the complexity of finding $K_t$ as interval minor in ordered graphs (i.e. graphs with a linear order on the vertices, in which intervals are contracted to form minors). Our main result is a polytime $f(t)$-approximation algorithm, where $f$ is triply exponential in $t$ but independent of $n$. The algorithm is based on delayed decompositions and shows that ordered graphs without a $K_t$ interval minor can be constructed via a bounded number of three operations: closure under substitutions, edge union, and concatenation of a stable set. As a byproduct, graphs avoiding $K_t$ as an interval minor have bounded chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Second Price Matching with Complete Allocation and Degree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Second Price Matching problem, introduced by Azar, Birnbaum, Karlin, and Nguyen in 2009. In this problem, a bipartite graph (bidders and goods) is given, and the profit of a matching is the number of matches containing a second unmatched bidder. Maximizing profit is known to be APX-hard and the current best approximation guarantee is $1/2$. APX-hardness even holds when all degrees are bounded by a constant. In this paper, we investigate the approximability of the problem under regular degree constraints. Our main result is an improved approximation guarantee of $9/10$ for Second Price Matching in $(3,2)$-regular graphs and an exact polynomial-time algorithm for $(d,2)$-regular graphs if $d\geq 4$. Our algorithm and its analysis are based on structural results in non-bipartite matching, in particular the Tutte-Berge formula coupled with novel combinatorial augmentation methods.
  We also introduce a variant of Second Price Matching where all goods have to be matched, which models the setting of expiring goods. We prove that this problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than $(1-1/e)$ and show that the problem can be approximated to a tight $(1-1/e)$ factor by maximizing a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint. We then show that our algorithm also solves this problem exactly on regular degree constrained graphs as above.</description>

      <title>On the Depth of Monotone ReLU Neural Networks and ICNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$ ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we broaden the understanding of the recently introduced concepts of solid-locating-dominating and self-locating-dominating codes in various graphs. In particular, we present the optimal, i.e., smallest possible, codes in the infinite triangular and king grids. Furthermore, we give optimal locating-dominating, self-locating-dominating and solid-locating-dominating codes in the direct product $K_n\times K_m$ of complete graphs. We also present optimal solid-locating-dominating codes for the Hamming graphs $K_q\square K_q\square K_q$ with $q\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Grid Minors and Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments regarding the product structure of planar graphs, we study relationships between treewidth, grid minors, and graph products. We show that the Cartesian product of any two connected $n$-vertex graphs contains an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})\times\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ grid minor. This result is tight: The lexicographic product (which includes the Cartesian product as a subgraph) of a star and any $n$-vertex tree has no $\omega(\sqrt{n})\times\omega(\sqrt{n})$ grid minor.</description>

      <title>Efficient counting of permutation patterns via double posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Corner trees, introduced in "Even-Zohar and Leng, 2021, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", allow for the efficient counting of certain permutation patterns. Here we identify corner trees as a subset of finite (strict) double posets, which we term twin-tree double posets. They are contained in both twin double posets and tree double posets, giving candidate sets for generalizations of corner tree countings. We provide the generalization of an algorithm proposed by Even-Zohar/Leng to a class of tree double posets, thereby enlarging the space of permutations that can be counted in O(n^{5/3}).</description>

      <title>A review of minimum cost box searching games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of zero-sum search games in which a Hider hides one or more target among a set of $n$ boxes. The boxes may require differing amount of time to search, and detection may be imperfect, so that there is a certain probability that a target may not be found when a box is searched, even when it is there. A Searcher must choose how to search the boxes sequentially, and wishes to minimize the expected time to find the target(s), whereas the Hider wishes to maximize this payoff. We review some known solutions to different cases of this game.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>
