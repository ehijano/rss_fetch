      <title>Research the influence of road surface conditions on vibration and safety of Semi Trailer vehicle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Depending on the road surface profile, moving speed, transport weight, etc., the vehicle's body acceleration and dynamic load coefficient change as it moves. This study's goal is to ascertain the result of the road surface's influence on the vehicle, calculate the average vehicle body displacement acceleration and dynamic load coefficient, and validate your findings through testing. To confirm the simulation model's accuracy, experimental and theoretical simulation results are compared.. Methods: The Neuton-Euler approach and the multi-body system structure separation method are used in the paper to create dynamic equations using theoretical research methods [1]. Simulations are carried out using Matlab Simulink software to examine and assess the dynamics. Results: According to ISO 8608:2016 standard [2], theoretical research results have determined the average acceleration of the vehicle body, dynamic load coefficient, horizontal sway angle, and longitudinal sway angle when the vehicle moves on profiles C, D , E, F. Experiments show that there is an error of 7.4% and 8.1% when measuring the average acceleration and dynamic load coefficient k{\dj}max when the vehicle moves at a speed of 50 km/h on the road surface C compared to theory.</description>

      <title>Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential buildings to advance net-zero ambitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential building operations is a crucial strategy for advancing China's net-zero ambitions. This study is the first to employ a static-dynamic modeling approach to project future emission trends, particularly carbon peaks, in residential buildings across each province of China up to 2060. An optimized provincial carbon budget assessment scheme for residential buildings, based on the principle of maximizing expected emission reduction potential, is also proposed. Findings show that (1) in the business-as-usual scenario, the emissions for urban and rural residential buildings are projected to peak at 990 (+-0.7) and 450 (+-0.2) mega-tons of CO2 (MtCO2), respectively, with peak years occurring in 2031 (+-4.7) and 2026 (+-2.6). (2) In the decarbonization scenario, peak emissions decrease to 900 MtCO2 and 430 MtCO2 for urban and rural buildings, respectively. (3) The provinces with the highest emission reduction requirements are Henan (16.74 MtCO2), Xinjiang (12.59 MtCO2), Gansu (9.87 MtCO2), Hebei (8.46 MtCO2), and Guangdong (3.37 MtCO2), with Northwest China shouldering the greatest reduction responsibility, totaling 38.14 MtCO2. In conclusion, this study provides a dynamically optimized carbon budget assessment scheme for residential buildings, offering valuable insights for government policy-making and playing a key role in facilitating the low-carbon transition of China's building sector during the pre-2030 planning period, ultimately contributing to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector by mid-century.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Regional Cooling Demand Prediction with Optimised Dataset Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of global warming, even relatively cooler countries like the UK are experiencing a rise in cooling demand, particularly in southern regions such as London. This growing demand, especially during the summer months, presents significant challenges for energy management systems. Accurately predicting cooling demand in urban domestic buildings is essential for maintaining energy efficiency. This study introduces a generalised framework for developing high-resolution Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks using physical model-based summer cooling demand data. To maximise the predictive capability and generalisation ability of the models under limited data scenarios, four distinct data partitioning strategies were implemented, including the extrapolation, month-based interpolation, global interpolation, and day-based interpolation. Bayesian Optimisation (BO) was then applied to fine-tune the hyper-parameters, substantially improving the framework predictive accuracy. Results show that the day-based interpolation GRU model demonstrated the best performance due to its ability to retain both the data randomness and the time sequence continuity characteristics. This optimal model achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.22%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.87%, and a coefficient of determination (R square) of 0.9386 on the test set. The generalisation ability of this framework was further evaluated by forecasting.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of global floorspace data presents challenges in achieving building carbon neutrality. We analyze 2,140 peer-reviewed papers on global building floorspace, focusing on energy and emissions. The top five countries publishing the most include China, the UK, the US, Italy, and Spain. The key research topics include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments, particularly for residential buildings. Measurement approaches (top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid), each face challenges, with top-down methods offering broad estimates but tending to low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are precise but requiring intensive data. Our latest simulations reveal significant floorspace growth in emerging economies, particularly India, Indonesia, and Africa. By 2070, India's per capita residential floorspace is projected to triple, whereas Indonesia's non-residential floorspace could increase sevenfold. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts, while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying deviations from Gaussianity with application to flight delays distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for quantifying deviations from Gaussianity by leveraging the permutation Jensen-Shannon distance. Using stable distributions as a flexible framework, we analyze the effects of skewness and heavy tails in synthetic sequences. We employ phase-randomized surrogates as Gaussian references to systematically evaluate the statistical distance between this reference and stable distributions. Our methodology is validated using real flight delay datasets from major airports in Europe and the United States, revealing significant deviations from Gaussianity, particularly at high-traffic airports. These results highlight systematic air traffic management strategies differences between the two geographic regions.</description>

      <title>Improved estimation of the effective reproduction number with heterogeneous transmission rates and reporting delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the face of an infectious disease, a key epidemiological measure is the basic reproduction number, which quantifies the average secondary infections caused by a single case in a susceptible population. In practice, the effective reproduction number, denoted as $R_t$, is widely used to assess the transmissibility of the disease at a given time $t$. Real-time estimating this metric is vital for understanding and managing disease outbreaks. Traditional statistical inference often relies on two assumptions. One is that samples are assumed to be drawn from a homogeneous population distribution, neglecting significant variations in individual transmission rates. The other is the ideal case reporting assumption, disregarding time delays between infection and reporting. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate these critical factors and assess their impact on estimating $R_t$. We first introduce negative binomial and Weibull distributions to characterize transmission rates and reporting delays, respectively, based on which observation and state equations are formulated. Then, we employ a Bayesian filtering for estimating $R_t$. Finally, validation using synthetic and empirical data demonstrates a significant improvement in estimation accuracy compared to conventional methods that ignore these factors.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic centers in cities worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban centers serve as engines of regional development, yet accurately defining and identifying the socioeconomic centers of cities globally remains a big challenge. Existing mapping efforts are often limited to large cities in developed regions and rely on data sources that are unavailable in many developing countries. This data scarcity hinders the establishment of consistent urban indicators, such as accessibility, to assess progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we develop and validate a global map of the socioeconomic centers of cities for 2020 by integrating nighttime light and population density data within an advanced geospatial modeling framework. Our analysis reveals that monocentric cities -- the standard urban model -- still dominate our planet, accounting for over 80% of cities worldwide. However, these monocentric cities encompass only approximately 20% of the total urbanized area, urban population, and nighttime light intensity; this 80/20 pattern underscores significant disparities in urban development. Further analysis, combined with socioeconomic datasets, reveals a marked difference between developed and developing regions: high-income countries exhibit greater polycentricity than low-income countries, demonstrating a positive correlation between urban sprawl and economic growth. Our global dataset and findings provide critical insights into urban structure and development, with important implications for urban planning, policymaking, and the formulation of indicators for urban sustainability assessment.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dealbreakers and Robust Policies for the Energy Transition Amid Unexpected Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disruptions in energy imports, backlash in social acceptance, and novel technologies failing to develop are unexpected events that are often overlooked in energy planning, despite their ability to jeopardize the energy transition. We propose a method to explore unexpected events and assess their impact on the transition pathway of a large-scale whole-energy system. First, we evaluate unexpected events assuming "perfect foresight", where decision-makers can anticipate such events in advance. This allows us to identify dealbreakers, i.e., conditions that make the transition infeasible. Then, we assess the events under "limited foresight" to evaluate the robustness of early-stage decisions against unforeseen unexpected events and the costs associated with managing them. A case study for Belgium demonstrates that a lack of electrofuel imports in 2050 is the main dealbreaker, while accelerating the deployment of renewables is the most robust policy. Our transferable method can help policymakers identify key dealbreakers and devise robust energy transition policies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Individual-Space Relationships to Inform and Enhance Location-Based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complex dynamics of human navigation and spatial behavior is essential for advancing location-based services, public health, and related fields. This paper investigates the multifaceted relationship between individuals and their environments (e.g. location and places they visit), acknowledging the distinct influences of personal preferences, experiences, and social connections. While certain locations hold sentimental value and are frequently visited, others function as mere transitory points. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to exploit visitation patterns and dwell times to characterize an individual's relationship with specific locations. We identify seven key types of spatial relationships and analyze the discrepancies among these visit types across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions. Our analysis highlights key findings, such as the prevalence of anchored-like visits (e.g. home, work) in both real-world Singapore and Beijing datasets, with unique associations in each city -Singapore's anchored-liked visits include recreational spaces, while Beijing's are limited to residential, business, and educational sites. These findings emphasize the importance of geographic and cultural context in shaping mobility and their potential in benefiting the precision and personalization of location-based services.</description>

      <title>Diminishing Waters: The Great Salt Lake's Desiccation and Its Mental Health Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how the desiccation of Utah Great Salt Lake GSL, exacerbated by anthropogenic changes, poses significant health risks, particularly communities mental health. Reduced water inflow has exposed the lakebed, increasing airborne particulate matter PM2.5 and dust storms, which impact air quality. By integrating diverse datasets spanning from 1980 to present including insitu measurements, satellite imagery, and reanalysis products this study synthesizes hydrological, atmospheric, and epidemiological variables to comprehensively track the extent of the GSL surface water, local air quality fluctuations, and their effects on community mental health. The findings indicate a clear relationship between higher pollution days and more severe depressive symptoms. Specifically, individuals exposed to 22 days with PM2.5 levels above the World Health Organizations 24 hour guideline of 15 ug per m3 were more likely to experience severe depressive symptoms. Our results also suggest that people experiencing more severe depression not only face a higher number of high pollution days but also encounter such days more frequently. The study highlights the interconnectedness of poor air quality, environmental degradation and mental health emphasizing the need for more sustainable economic growth in the region.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Physical-Layer Information on Epidemic Spreading in Cyber-Physical Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Granell et al. proposed a multiplex network for information and epidemic propagation, researchers have explored how information propagation affects epidemic dynamics. However, the role of individuals acquiring information through physical interactions has received relatively less attention. In this work, we introduce a novel source of information: physical layer information, and derive the epidemic outbreak threshold using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Our simulation results indicate that the outbreak threshold derived from the MMCA is consistent with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find that the physical-layer information effectively increases the population's awareness density and the infection threshold $\beta_c$, while reducing the population's infection density, thereby suppressing the spreading of the epidemic. Another interesting finding is that when the density of 2-simplex information is relatively high, the 2-simplex plays a role similar to pairwise interaction, significantly enhancing the population's awareness density and effectively preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. In addition, our model works equally well for cyber physical systems with similar interaction mechanisms, while we simulate and validate it in a real grid system.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear treatment for spent fuel radiotoxicity reduction: a case study investigation on minor actinides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The management of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) is one of the main challenges in the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Thermal reactors, such as Light Water Reactors (LWRs), produce significant amounts of minor actinides (MAs) such as Americium, Curium, and Neptunium, which are key contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity and decay heat in SNF. Currently, the long term widely accepted solution is the geological disposal. At the same time, advanced technologies like Partitioning and Transmutation (P\&amp;T) offer promising solutions to reduce SNF long-term radiotoxicity. While most transmutation strategies rely on neutron fluxes, in this study the adoption of photon beam to induce photonuclear reactions in SNF is investigated, without depending on neutron based systems. In particular, the study focuses on the probability of inducing transmutations and fissions on MAs, by leveraging the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region of photonuclear interactions. In the investigated case study, the effect of a photon driven transmutation of minor actinides present in a spent fuel from SMR technology was evaluated. This approach offers a novel solution to the challenges of nuclear waste management which may become an alternative path in treating the radiotoxicity of minor actinides with the adoption of high enough photon fluxes.</description>

Abstract: Many societal challenges, such as climate change or disease outbreaks, require coordinated behavioral changes. For many behaviors, the tendency of individuals to adhere to social norms can reinforce the status quo. However, these same social processes can also result in rapid, self-reinforcing change. Interventions may be strategically targeted to initiate endogenous social change processes, often referred to as social tipping. While recent research has considered how the size and targeting of such interventions impact their effectiveness at bringing about change, they tend to overlook constraints faced by policymakers, including the cost, speed, and distributional consequences of interventions. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that includes heterogeneous agents and networks of local influence. We implement various targeting heuristics based on information about individual preferences and commonly used local network properties to identify individuals to incentivize. Analytical and simulation results suggest that there is a trade-off between preventing backsliding among targeted individuals and promoting change among non-targeted individuals. Thus, where the change is initiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is essential to the effectiveness of interventions. We identify cost-optimal strategies under different scenarios, such as varying levels of resistance to change, preference heterogeneity, and homophily. These results provide insights that can be experimentally tested and help policymakers to better direct incentives.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>
