      <title>High-order alloharmonics produced by nonperiodic drivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order harmonics are ubiquitous in nature and present in electromagnetic, acoustic, and gravitational waves. They are generated by periodic nonlinear processes or periodic high-frequency pulses. However, this periodicity is often inexact, such as that in chirped (frequency-swept) optical waveforms or interactions with nonstationary matter - for instance, reflection from accelerating mirrors. Spectra observed in such cases often contain complicated sets of harmonic-like fringes, uninterpretable or even misinterpretable via standard Fourier analysis. Here, we propose the concept of alloharmonics, i.e. spectral interference of harmonics with different orders, fully explaining the formation of these fringes (from Greek $\ddot{{\alpha}}{\lambda}{\lambda}{\omicron}{\varsigma}$: \'allos, "other"). Like atomic spectra, the complex alloharmonic spectra depend on several integer numbers and bear a unique imprint of the emission process, such as the driver period and its time derivatives, which the alloharmonic theory can decipher. We demonstrate laser-driven alloharmonics experimentally in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region and extract nonperiodicity parameters. We analyze previously published simulations of gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole mergers and demonstrate alloharmonics there. Further, we predict the presence of alloharmonics in the radio spectra of pulsars and in optical frequency combs, and propose their use for measurement of extremely small accelerations necessary for testing gravity theories. The alloharmonics phenomenon generalizes classical harmonics and is critical in attosecond physics, frequency comb generation, pulsar studies, and future gravitational wave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>On the invariant integration of a vector in some problems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invariant integration of vectors and tensors over manifolds was introduced around fifty years ago by V.N. Folomeshkin, though the concept has not attracted much attention among researchers. Although it is a sophisticated concept, the operation of the invariant integration of vectors is actually required to correctly solve some problems in mechanics. Two such problems are discussed in the present exposition, in the context of a two-dimensional Euclidean space covered by a polar coordinate system. The notion of invariant integration becomes necessary when the space is described without any reference to a Cartesian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most theories and applications of elasticity rely on an energy function that depends on the strains from which the stresses can be derived. This is the traditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity. However, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the existence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity, stresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern elasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively limited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work performed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero. Therefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks. This characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of Cauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this paper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling of active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented here is a transcription of the lecture notes from Professor Allan N. Kaufman's graduate statistical mechanics course at Berkeley from the 1972-1973 academic year. Part 1 addresses equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, classical fluids and other systems, chemical equilibrium, and long-range interactions. Part 2 addresses non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, Brownian motion, Liouville and Klimontovich equations, Landau equation, Markov processes and Fokker-Planck equation, linear response and transport theory, and an introduction to non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics.</description>
