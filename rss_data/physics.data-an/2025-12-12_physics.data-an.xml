      <title>Clues from $\mathcal{Q}$--A null test designed for line intensity mapping cross-correlation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.</description>

      <title>Identifying Neutron Sources using Recoil and Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($&gt;\!\!4\sigma$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.</description>

      <title>Detailed balance in large language model-driven agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Model Selection for Battery Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based battery modelling has emerged to accelerate battery materials discovery and performance assessment. Its success, however, is still hindered by difficulties in aligning models to experimental data. Bayesian approaches are a valuable tool to overcome these challenges, since they enable prior assumptions and observations to be combined in a principled manner that improves numerical conditioning. Here we introduce two new algorithms to the battery community, SOBER and BASQ, that greatly speed up Bayesian inference for parameterisation and model comparison. We showcase how Bayesian model selection allows us to tackle data observability, model identifiability, and data-informed model development together. We propose this approach for the search for battery models of novel materials.</description>

      <title>MorphZ: Enhancing evidence estimation through the Morph approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Morph approximation, a class of product approximations of probability densities that selects low-order disjoint parameter blocks by maximizing the sum of their total correlations. We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.</description>

      <title>Identifiable factor analysis for mixed continuous and binary variables based on the Gaussian-Grassmann distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a factor analysis for mixed continuous and binary observed variables. To this end, we utilized a recently developed multivariate probability distribution for mixed-type random variables, the Gaussian-Grassmann distribution. In the proposed factor analysis, marginalization over latent variables can be performed analytically, yielding an analytical expression for the distribution of the observed variables. This analytical tractability allows model parameters to be estimated using standard gradient-based optimization techniques. We also address improper solutions associated with maximum likelihood factor analysis. We propose a prescription to avoid improper solutions by imposing a constraint that row vectors of the factor loading matrix have the same norm for all features. Then, we prove that the proposed factor analysis is identifiable under the norm constraint. We demonstrate the validity of this norm constraint prescription and numerically verified the model's identifiability using both real and synthetic datasets. We also compare the proposed model with quantification method and found that the proposed model achieves better reproducibility of correlations than the quantification method.</description>

      <title>Estimating Detector Error Models on Google's Willow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Testing models for angular power spectra: A distribution-free approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spatial Clustering of Single-Molecule Localizations with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy generates point clouds corresponding to fluorophore localizations. Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multifunctional Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</description>
