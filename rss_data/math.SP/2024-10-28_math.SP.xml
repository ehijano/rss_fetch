      <title>Reflectionless Dirac operators and canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical systems that are reflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the two half line $m$ functions are holomorphic continuations of each other and may thus be combined into a single holomorphic function. This idea was explored in [11], and we continue these investigations here. We focus on Dirac operators and especially their interplay with canonical systems, and we provide a more general and abstract framework.</description>

      <title>Concentration of eigenfunctions on singular Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and a metric that is singular at the boundary. The associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is of the form of a Grushin operator plus a singular potential. In a supercritical parameter regime, we identify the rate of concentration and profile of the high-frequency eigenfunctions that accumulate at the boundary. We give an application to acoustic modes on gas planets.</description>

      <title>On shape optimization for fourth order Steklov eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three types of fourth-order Steklov eigenvalue problems. For the first two of them, we derive the asymptotic expansion of their spectra on Euclidean annular domains $\mathbb{B}^n_1\setminus \overline{\mathbb{B}^n_\epsilon}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, leading to conclusions on shape optimization. For these two problems, we also compute their spectra on cylinders over closed Riemannian manifolds. Last, for the third problem, we obtain a sharp upper bound for its first non-zero eigenvalue on star-shaped and mean convex Euclidean domains.</description>

      <title>Nikishin systems on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Nikishin system of $r$ probability measures on the unit circle. We show that such systems satisfy the AT property and therefore normality, introduced in~\cite{KVMLOPUC}, for any multi-index $(n_1,\ldots,n_r)\in\mathbb{N}^r$ with same-parity components satisfying $n_1 \ge n_2 \ge\ldots\ge n_r$. In the case of $r=2$, we demonstrate that the same property holds without requiring $n_1 \ge n_2 \ge\ldots\ge n_r$.
  The analogous simple proof works for Nikishin systems on the real line for indices satisfying $n_j\ge \max\{n_{j+1},\ldots,n_r\}-1$, $j=1,\ldots,r-1$. This is related to the proof by Cousseement and Van Assche for $r=2$.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric and geometric inequalities in quantitative form: Stein's method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature, diameter and eigenvalues of amply regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and volume growth. In particular, we obtain a volume estimate of amply regular graphs which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for the Steklov problem on differential forms in warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Steklov problem on differential $p$-forms defined by M. Karpukhin and present geometric eigenvalue bounds in the setting of warped product manifolds in various scenarios. In particular, we obtain Escobar type lower bounds for warped product manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, and certain sharp bounds for hypersurfaces of revolution, among others. We compare and contrast the behaviour with known results in the case of functions (i.e., $0$-forms), highlighting the influence of the underlying topology on the spectrum for $p$-forms in general.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability in a free boundary model of active locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplest model of contraction-driven self-propulsion of keratocytes reduces to a one dimensional Keller-Segel system with free boundaries. This "active" model involving both dissipation and anti-dissipation features stationary and traveling wave solutions representing static and moving cells, respectively. The goal of this paper is to provide the first rigorous proof of the asymptotic nonlinear stability of both of such solutions. In the case of stationary solutions, the linear stability is established using the spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators, and thus linear stability is determined solely by eigenvalues. For traveling waves the picture is more complex because the linearized problem is non-self-adjoint, opening the possibility of a "dark" area in the phase space which is not "visible" in the purely eigenvalue/eigenvector approach. To establish linear stability in this case we employ spectral methods together with the Gearhart-Pruss-Greiner Theorem, which requires a uniform bound on the resolvent of the linear operator. For both stationary and traveling wave solutions, nonlinear stability is then proved by showing how the nonlinear part of the problem may be controlled by the linear part and then employing a Gr\"onwall inequality argument. The developed methodology can prove useful also in other problems involving non-Hermitian and non-reciprocal operators which are ubiquitous in the description of active matter.</description>

      <title>Three observations on the Colin de Verdi\`ere spectral graph parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this small note, we collect several observations pertaining to the famous spectral graph parameter $\mu$ introduced in 1990 by Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere. This parameter is defined as the maximum corank among certain matrices akin to weighted Laplacians; we call them CdV matrices.
  First, we answer negatively a question mentioned in passing in the influential 1996 survey on $\mu$ by van der Holst, Lov\'asz, and Schrijver concerning the Perron--Frobenious eigenvector of CdV matrices.
  Second, by definition, CdV matrices posses certain transversality property. In some cases, this property is known to be satisfied automatically. We add one such case to the list.
  Third, Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere conjectured an upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into a fixed closed surface. Following a recent computer-verified counterexample to a continuous version of the conjecture by Fortier Bourque, Gruda-Mediavilla, Petri, and Pineault [arXiv:2312.03504], we also check using computer that the analogous example shows the failure of the conjectured upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into 10-torus as well as to several other larger surfaces.</description>

      <title>On predicting for non-vanishing unbounded continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation as well as predictability and recoverability problems for non-vanishing unbounded continuous time signals, i.e., for signals that do not necessarily bounded at $\pm\infty$. The notions of transfer functions, spectrum gaps, bandlimitness, and low-pass filters are introduced for these signals.
  This allowed to obtain some frequency criteria for predictability and predictors for signals with a single point spectrum degeneracy and with sublinear rate of growth.</description>
