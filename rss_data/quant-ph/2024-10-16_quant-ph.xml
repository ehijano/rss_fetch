      <title>Solving the Lindblad equation with methods from computational fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liouvillian dynamics describes the evolution of a density operator in closed quantum systems. One extension towards open quantum systems is provided by the Lindblad equation. It is applied to various systems and energy regimes in solid state physics as well as also in nuclear physics. A main challenge is that analytical solutions for the Lindblad equation are only obtained for harmonic system potentials or two-level systems. For other setups one has to rely on numerical methods.
  In this work, we propose to use a method from computational fluid dynamics, the Kurganov-Tadmor central (finite volume) scheme, to numerically solve the Lindblad equation in position-space representation. We will argue, that this method is advantageous in terms of the efficiency concerning initial conditions, discretization, and stability.
  On the one hand, we study, the applicability of this scheme by performing benchmark tests. Thereby we compare numerical results to analytic solutions and discuss aspects like boundary conditions, initial values, conserved quantities, and computational efficiency. On the other hand, we also comment on new qualitative insights to the Lindblad equation from its reformulation in terms of an advection-diffusion equation with source/sink terms.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits via Intermediary Matrix Product Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-tunable Telecom Single Photons Enabled by Low-noise Optomechanical Transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are of fundamental importance to emergent quantum technologies. Nano-structured optomechanical crystals provide an attractive platform for single photon generation due to their unique engineering freedom and compatibility with on-chip silicon fabrication. However, optical absorption heating has thus far prevented these systems from being widely used in practical applications. Here, we overcome this limitation through the use of a quasi-two-dimensional optomechanical crystal structure and demonstrate an on-chip source of single photons natively at telecom wavelength. We verify the low thermal noise and resulting high purity of the generated single photons through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.35^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$. Furthermore, we perform Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the emitted photons showcasing the indistinguishability and coherence of photons generated from our source with visibility $V=0.52 \pm 0.15$ after 1.43 km of fiber delay line. With the possibility of using the mechanical mode as a quantum memory, we can retrieve the single photons on-demand. Crucial for applications, the optomechanical interaction at the heart of our device allows the bandwidth of emitted single photons to be tuned over a large range from 100 kHz to several hundreds of MHz, which makes them directly compatible with leading quantum memory platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol that accounts for fundamental practical challenges, including chromatic dispersion, time measurement uncertainty, and dark counts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of these physical phenomena on QKD efficiency, offering practical strategies for enhancing the robustness and security of quantum communication systems in real-world applications. In particular, by manipulating the chirp parameter of single-photon wave packets, we demonstrate significant improvements in key generation rates and an extended range of secure communication.</description>

      <title>Universal Characterization of Quantum Many-Body States through Local Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Robust spontaneous parametric down-conversion via detuning modulated composite segments designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) holds a pivotal role in quantum physics, facilitating the creation of entangled photon pairs, heralded single photons and squeezed light, critical resources for many applications in quantum technologies. However, their production is highly sensitive to physical variations, posing limitations on their robust utility. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a method to significantly enhance the reliability of entangled photon pair generation. Our approach involves introducing a composite design scheme to the SPDC process. The design is based on the development of a theoretical composite segments framework for SU(1,1), offering increased error resilience and robustness of the process. We experimentally demonstrate its practical application by modulating the nonlinear coefficient of a KTP crystal for degenerate 532nm to 1064nm conversion resulting in an effectiveness of sevenfold improvement in stability of photon-pair generation and coincidence rate against temperature fluctuations compared to conventional quasi-phase-matching techniques. Furthermore, the presented concept is applicable to other physical systems that exhibit SU(1,1) dynamics. Our methodology represents a monumental leap forward in quantum technologies, significantly enhancing stability and error tolerance that pave the way for a new generation of entangled photons sources, holding immense promise for quantum information processing, communication, and precision measurement applications.</description>

      <title>From Uncertainty Relations to Quantum Acceleration Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of quantum acceleration limit has been recently introduced for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems under arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. While Alsing and Cafaro [Int. J. Geom. Methods Mod. Phys. 21, 2440009 (2024)] used the Robertson uncertainty relation in their derivation, Pati [arXiv:2312.00864 (2023)] employed the Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation to find the upper bound on the temporal rate of change of the speed of quantum evolutions. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of these two alternative derivations for quantum systems specified by an arbitrary finite-dimensional projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, focusing on a geometric description of the quantum evolution of two-level quantum systems on a Bloch sphere under general time-dependent Hamiltonians, we find the most general conditions needed to attain the maximal upper bounds on the acceleration of the quantum evolution. In particular, these conditions are expressed explicitly in terms of two three-dimensional real vectors, the Bloch vector that corresponds to the evolving quantum state and the magnetic field vector that specifies the Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system. For pedagogical reasons, we illustrate our general findings for two-level quantum systems in explicit physical examples characterized by specific time-varying magnetic field configurations. Finally, we briefly comment on the extension of our considerations to higher-dimensional physical systems in both pure and mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Squeezing via self-induced transparency in mercury-filled photonic crystal fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the squeezing of ultrashort pulses using self-induced transparency in a mercury-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Our focus is on quadrature squeezing at low mercury vapor pressures, with atoms near resonance on the $^3{\rm D}_3 \to 6^3{\rm P}_2$ transition. We vary the atomic density, thus the gas pressure (from 2.72 to 15.7$\mu$bar), by adjusting the temperature (from 273~K to 303 ~K). Our results show that achieving squeezing at room temperature, considering both fermionic and bosonic mercury isotopes, requires ultrashort femtosecond pulses. We also determine the optimal detection length for squeezing at different pressures and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Generalized measurements on qubits in quantum randomness certification and expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has greatly impacted our understanding of the microscopic nature. One of the key concepts of this theory is generalized measurements, which have proven useful in various quantum information processing tasks. However, despite their significance, they have not yet been shown empirically to provide an advantage in quantum randomness certification and expansion protocols. This investigation explores scenarios where generalized measurements can yield more than one bit of certified randomness with a single qubit system measurement on untrusted devices and against a quantum adversary. We compare the robustness of several protocols to exhibit the advantage of exploiting generalized measurements. In our analysis of experimental data, we were able to obtain $1.21$ bits of min-entropy from a measurement taken on one qubit of an entangled state. We also obtained $1.07$ bits of min-entropy from an experiment with quantum state preparation and generalized measurement on a single qubit. We also provide finite data analysis for a protocol using generalized measurements and the Entropy Accumulation Theorem. Our exploration demonstrates the potential of generalized measurements to improve the certification of quantum sources of randomness and enhance the security of quantum cryptographic protocols and other areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning approach to reconstruct Density Matrices from Quantum Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to address one aspect of the quantum marginal problem: finding a global density matrix compatible with a given set of quantum marginals. Our method involves combining a quantum marginal imposition technique with convolutional denoising autoencoders. The loss function ensures that the output density matrix satisfies essential properties such as hermiticity, positivity, and normalization. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a high success rate and accuracy. Our model can serve as an initial guess generator for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) associated with the quantum marginal problem, potentially accelerating convergence and improving accuracy. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques to address complex problems in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Entanglement and Quantum Sensing from Energy Transfer in two-tone Floquet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced sensors, which surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) and approach the fundamental precision limits dictated by quantum mechanics, are finding applications across a wide range of scientific fields. This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied$\unicode{x2013}$particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty and imperfect transmission, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Relationship between average correlation and quantum steering for arbitrary two-qubit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality and nonclassicality are two remarkable characteristics of quantum theory, and offer quantum advantages in some quantum information processing. Motivated by recent work on the interplay between nonclassicality quantified by average correlation [Tschaffon et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5,023063 (2023)] and Bell nonlocality, in this paper we aim to establish the relationship between the average correlation and the violation of the three-setting linear steering inequality for two-qubit systems. Exact lower and upper bounds of average correlation versus steering are obtained, and the respective states which suffice those bounds are also characterized. For clarity of our presentation, we illustrate these results with examples from well-known classes of two-qubit states. Moreover, the dynamical behavior of these two quantifiers is carefully analyzed under the influence of local unital and nonunital noisy channels. The results suggest that average correlation is closely related to the violation of three-setting linear steering, like its relationship with Bell violation. Particularly, for a given class of states, the hierarchy of nonclassicality-steering-Bell nonlocality is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Routing and Scheduling Optimization for Urban Air Mobility Fleet Management using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of urban air mobility (UAM) for urban transportation and delivery has accelerated due to increasing traffic congestion and its environmental and economic repercussions. Efficiently managing the anticipated high-density air traffic in cities is critical to ensure safe and effective operations. In this study, we propose a routing and scheduling framework to address the needs of a large fleet of UAM vehicles operating in urban areas. Using mathematical optimization techniques, we plan efficient and deconflicted routes for a fleet of vehicles. Formulating route planning as a maximum weighted independent set problem enables us to utilize various algorithms and specialized optimization hardware, such as quantum annealers, which has seen substantial progress in recent years. Our method is validated using a traffic management simulator tailored for the airspace in Singapore. Our approach enhances airspace utilization by distributing traffic throughout a region. This study broadens the potential applications of optimization techniques in UAM traffic management.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement from many-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimation of entanglement in atomistic systems requires a combination of advanced ab initio calculations - to account for the effect of the electron-electron interaction - and rigorous quantum-informational theoretical analyses. This combination is a challenging task that has not been tackled so far to investigate genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in materials. Here we show, contrary to conventional wisdom, that a high degree of GME can be extracted from closed-shell molecular states - even in the non-interacting limit. Because the relevant states fulfill the super-selection rules, the generated entanglement may in principle represent also a physical resource.</description>

      <title>Quantum-optical sensing and target detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis presents three studies in quantum-enhanced sensing and target detection. The first study explores covert target detection using optical or microwave probes, establishing quantum-mechanical limits on the error probabilities of entanglement-assisted detection methods while maintaining the sender's covertness. It identifies the minimal energy required to preserve covertness and reduce error probabilities, compares two-mode squeezed vacuum probes and coherent states against these limits, and extends the analysis to discriminating thermal loss channels and non-adversarial quantum illumination. The second study focuses on phase-insensitive optical amplifiers, determining the quantum limit on the precision of gain estimation using multimode probes possibly entangled with ancillary systems. It finds that the average photon number and the number of input modes are interchangeable resources for achieving optimal gain sensing precision, contrasting classical probes with quantum probes and highlighting the advantages of the latter, even with single-photon inputs and inefficient photodetection. It also provides a closed-form expression for the energy-constrained Bures distance between two amplifier channels. The third study compares three probe states -- coherent state, two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV), and single-photon entangled state (SPES) -- in quantum-enhanced target detection, assessing their performance under signal energy constraints relevant to covert radar sensing. SPES is uniquely positioned as a practical probe due to its non-classical properties after thermal loss and ease of generation. Numerical analysis shows that at low signal energies, the error exponent of TMSV aligns with SPES, indicating comparable detection capabilities and that SPES surpasses the best classical state-the coherent state-in accuracy for certain signal strengths.</description>

      <title>Simulation of satellite and optical link dynamics in a quantum repeater constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters and satellite-based optical links are complementary technological approaches to overcome the exponential photon loss in optical fibers and thus allow quantum communication on a global scale. We analyze architectures which combine these approaches and use satellites as quantum repeater nodes to distribute entanglement to distant optical ground stations. Here we simulate dynamic, three-dimensional ground station passes, going beyond previous studies that typically consider static satellite links. For this, we numerically solve the equations of motion of the dynamic system consisting of three satellites in low Earth orbit. The model of the optical link takes into account atmospheric attenuation, single-mode fiber coupling, beam wandering and broadening, as well as adaptive optics effects. We derive analytical expressions for the Bell state measurement and associated error rates for quantum memory assisted communications, including retrieval efficiency and state coherence. We consider downlink and uplink architectures for continental and intercontinental connections and evaluate the impact of satellite altitude and inter-satellite distance on the expected entanglement swapping rate. Our simulation model enables us to design different orbital configurations for the satellite constellation and analyze the annual performance of the quantum repeater under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust microwave cavity control for NV ensemble manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles have the potential to improve a wide range of applications, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at the microscale and nanoscale, wide-field magnetometry, and hyperpolarization of nuclear spins via the transfer of optically induced NV polarization to nearby nuclear spin clusters. These NV ensembles can be coherently manipulated with microwave cavities, that deliver strong and homogeneous drivings over large volumes. However, the pulse shaping for microwave cavities presents the added challenge that the external controls and intra-cavity field amplitudes are not identical, leading to adverse effects on the accuracy of operations on the NV ensemble. In this work, we introduce a method based on Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to optimize external controls, resulting in robust pulses within the cavity while minimizing the effects of cavity ringings. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by designing both $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulses. These optimized controls are then integrated into a PulsePol sequence, where numerical simulations reveal a resilience to detunings five times larger than those tolerated by the sequence constructed using standard controls.</description>

      <title>Exponentially-enhanced quantum sensing with many-body phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on critical many-body systems are known to exhibit enhanced sensing capability. Such enhancements typically scale algebraically with the probe size. Going beyond algebraic advantage and reaching exponential scaling has remained elusive when all the resources, such as the preparation time, are taken into account. In this work, we show that systems with first order quantum phase transitions can indeed achieve exponential scaling of sensitivity, thanks to their exponential energy gap closing. Remarkably, even after considering the preparation time using local adiabatic driving, the exponential scaling is sustained. Our results are demonstrated through comprehensive analysis of three paradigmatic models exhibiting first order phase transitions, namely Grover, $p$-spin, and biclique models. We show that this scaling survives moderate decoherence during state preparation and also can be optimally measured in experimentally available basis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry-Driven Quantum Gate Design Based on Feynman Path Integral and TPCP Map Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use supersymmetry to enlarge the dimension of the Hilbert space on which the unitary evolution of the state of the quantum fields acts. We discuss how to control the unitary evolution or TPCP maps generated by the quantum evolution of the fields by controlling the vacuum expectations of other fields in the theory. This amounts to breaking supersymmetry using control vacuum expectation values of the other fields. The evolution of the wave functional or TPCP maps obtained by tracing out over other fields is based on the Feynman path integral formula for the fields. By using the methods of quantum stochastic filtering, we estimate the evolving state of the fields from non-demolition noise measurements and then design a family of TPCP maps evolving in time whose outputs match the estimated evolving state. In this way, we are able to simulate the evolution of the state of the quantum noisy fields. Direct matching of the designed TPCP map to output the evolving system state is not possible since there is no way by which we can determine the exact evolving state, we can only estimate it using non-demolition measurements. The family of designed TPCP maps can be based on using a simulated master equation with unknown parameters incorporated into the Hamiltonian and the other Lindblad operators, chosen so as to match the state outputted by the quantum filter.</description>

      <title>Conditional atomic cat state generation via superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</description>

      <title>Preparing topological states with finite depth simultaneous commuting gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present protocols for preparing two-dimensional abelian and non-abelian topologically ordered states by employing finite depth unitary circuits composed of long-ranged, simultaneous, and mutually commuting two-qubit gates. Our protocols are motivated by recent proposals for circuits in trapped ion systems, which allow each qubit to participate in multiple gates simultaneously. Our circuits are shown to be optimal, in the sense that the number of two-qubit gates and ancilla qubits scales as $O(L^2)$, where $L$ is the linear size of the system. Examples include the ground states of the toric code, certain Kitaev quantum double models, and string net models. Going beyond two dimensions, we extend our scheme to more general Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. As an application, we present protocols for realizing the three-dimensional Haah's code and X-Cube fracton models.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Speed Limits: Quantum Effect on the Speed in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of quantum speed limits, it has been shown that the minimum time required to cause a desired state conversion via the open quantum dynamics can be estimated using the entropy production. However, the established entropy-based bounds tend to be loose, making it difficult to accurately estimate the minimum time for evolution. In this research, we have combined the knowledge of the entropy-based speed limits with that of the resource theory of asymmetry (RTA) and provided much stricter inequalities. Our results show that the limitation on the change rate of states and expectation values can be divided into two parts: quantum coherence for energy (i.e., asymmetry) contributed by the system and the heat bath and the classical entropy-increasing effect from the bath. As a result, our inequalities demonstrate that the difference in the speed of evolution between classical and quantum open systems, i.e., the quantum enhancement in speed, is determined by the quantum Fisher information, which measures quantum fluctuations of energy and serves as a standard resource measure in the resource theory of asymmetry. We further show that a similar relation holds for the rate of change of expectation values of physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Generating entanglement of two acoustic modes by driving the qubit in circuit quantum acoustodynamics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose how to generate the entanglement of two long-lived phonon modes in a circuit quantum acoustodynamics system, which consists of a multi-mode high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator and a transmon-type superconducting qubit. Two acoustic modes couple to the qubit through piezoelectric interaction, and the qubit is driven by a microwave field. Under the condition of far detuning between the qubit and acoustic modes, the qubit can be eliminated adiabatically, and thus establishing the indirect interaction between the two acoustic modes. We demonstrate that such the indirect interaction can be the parametric-amplification-type interaction by appropriately choosing the drive frequency and strength, so the entanglement between acoustic modes can be created by the direct unitary evolution. We numerically analyze the parameter conditions for generating the entanglement in detail and evaluate the influence of system dissipations and noise. The results show that the scheme can be realized using currently available parameters and has strong robustness against the dissipations and environmental temperature. This work may provide efficient resource for the quantum information processing based on the phononic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Discrimination of Mixed Symmetric Multi-mode Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the optimal measurement for distinguishing between symmetric multi-mode phase-randomized coherent states. A motivation for this is that phase-randomized coherent states can be used for quantum communication, including quantum cryptography. The so-called square-root measurement is optimal for pure symmetric states, but is not always optimal for mixed symmetric states. When phase-randomizing a multi-mode coherent state, the state becomes a mixture of pure multi-mode states with different total photon numbers. We find that the optimal measurement for distinguishing between any set of phase-randomised coherent states can be realised by first counting the total number of photons, and then distinguishing between the resulting pure states in the corresponding photon-number subspace. If the multi-mode coherent states we started from are symmetric, then the optimal measurement in each subspace is a square-root measurement. The overall optimal measurement in the cases we consider is also a square-root measurement. In some cases, we are able to present a simple linear optical circuit that realizes the overall optimal measurement.</description>

      <title>Grover Adaptive Search with Spin Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Grover adaptive search (GAS) for a combinatorial optimization problem whose objective function involves spin variables. While the GAS algorithm with a conventional design of a quantum dictionary subroutine handles a problem associated with an objective function with binary variables $\{0,1\}$, we reformulate the problem using spin variables $\{+1,-1\}$ to simplify the algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a novel quantum dictionary subroutine that is designed for this spin-based formulation. A key benefit of this approach is the substantial reduction in the number of CNOT gates required to construct the quantum circuit. We theoretically demonstrate that, for certain problems, our proposed approach can reduce the gate complexity from an exponential order to a polynomial order, compared to the conventional binary-based approach. This improvement has the potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of GAS, particularly in larger quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Implementing Quantum Secret Sharing on Current Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing is a cryptographic scheme that enables a secure storage and reconstruction of quantum information. While the theory of secret sharing is mature in its development, relatively few studies have explored the performance of quantum secret sharing on actual devices. In this work, we provide a pedagogical description of encoding and decoding circuits for different secret sharing codes, and we test their performance on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane system. We evaluate the quality of implementation by performing a SWAP test between the decoded state and the ideal one, as well as by estimating how well the code preserves entanglement with a reference system. Results indicate that a ((3,5)) threshold secret sharing scheme performs slightly better overall than a ((5,7)) scheme based on the SWAP test, but is outperformed by the Steane Code scheme in regards to the entanglement fidelity. We also investigate one implementation of a ((2,3)) qutrit scheme and find that it performs the worst of all, which is expected due to the additional number of multi-qubit gate operations needed to encode and decode qutrits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bernoulli factory is a randomness manipulation routine that takes as input a Bernoulli random variable, outputting another Bernoulli variable whose bias is a function of the input bias. Recently proposed quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes encode both input and output variables in qubit amplitudes. This primitive could be used as a sub-routine for more complex quantum algorithms involving Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods. Here, we report an experimental implementation of a polarization-encoded photonic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. We present and test three interferometric set-ups implementing the basic operations of an algebraic field (inversion, multiplication, and addition) which, chained together, allow for the implementation of a generic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. These in-bulk schemes are validated using a quantum dot-based single-photon source featuring high brightness and indistinguishability, paired with a time-to-spatial demultiplexing setup to prepare input resources of up to three single-photon states.</description>

      <title>Non-unitarity maximizing unraveling of open quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of many-body quantum states in open systems is commonly numerically simulated by unraveling the density matrix into pure-state trajectories. In this work, we introduce a new unraveling strategy that can adaptively minimize the averaged entanglement in the trajectory states. This enables a more efficient classical representation of trajectories using matrix product decompositions. Our new approach is denoted non-unitarity maximizing unraveling (NUMU). It relies on the idea that adaptively maximizing the averaged non-unitarity of a set of Kraus operators leads to a more efficient trajectory entanglement destruction. Compared to other adaptive entanglement lowering algorithms, NUMU is computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate its utility in large-scale simulations with random quantum circuits. NUMU lowers runtimes in practical calculations, and it also provides new insight on the question of classical simulability of quantum dynamics. We show that for the quantum circuits considered here, unraveling methods are much less efficient than full matrix product density operator simulations, hinting to a still large potential for finding more advanced adaptive unraveling schemes.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates photonic continuous-variable Born machines (CVBMs), which utilize photonic quantum states as resources for continuous probability distributions. Implementing exact gradient descent in the CVBM training process is often infeasible, bringing forward the need to approximate the gradients using an estimator obtained from a smaller number of samples, obtaining a quantum stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. In this work, the ability to train CVBMs is analyzed using stochastic gradients obtained using relatively few samples from the probability distribution corresponding to homodyne measurement. The main obstacle to this analysis is that classically simulating CVBMs and obtaining samples is a demanding task, while a large number of iterations are needed to achieve convergence. The present research is enabled by a novel strategy to simulate homodyne detections of generic multimode photonic states using a classical computer. With this approach, a more comprehensive study of CVBMs is made possible, and the training of multimode CVBMs is demonstrated with parametric quantum circuits considerably larger than in previous articles. More specifically, we use the proposed algorithm to demonstrate learning of multimode quantum distributions using CVBMs. Moreover, successful CVBM trainings were demonstrated with the use of stochastic gradients.</description>

      <title>The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is really odd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When quantum state amplitudes interfere, surprising non-classical features emerge which emphasis the roles of indistinguishability and discreteness in quantum mechanics. A famous example in quantum optics is the Hong Ou Mandel interference effect,a major ingredient in current quantum information processing using photonics. Traditionally the HOM features interference between amplitudes for two one-photon number states. Surprisingly, interference can be manifested when one amplitude represents that most classical of light field states, the coherent state, provided the partner state is non-classical (eg a single photon state or an odd photon number state). Imposing such nonclassical features on an otherwise classical state is the focus of this article. Recently, the HOM effect has been generalized to the multi-photon case, termed the extended HOM effect by the authors.The implication of the extended HOM effect is that if an odd parity state, comprising only odd numbers of photons, enters one input port of a 50:50 beam splitter, then regardless of the state entering the other input port, be it pure or mixed, there will no output coincident counts. In this work, we explain the extended HOM as arising from a sequence of pairwise HOM-like complete destructive interferences occurring simultaneously in the multicomponent amplitude for the output coincidence counts. We first demonstrate this diagrammatically in order to build physical intuition, before developing a general analytical proof. We then examine the case of a single photon interacting with a coherent state (and idealized laser), and consider prospects for experimental detection by including the effect of imperfect detection efficiency. This work highlights the importance of the non-classicality of light, and in particular the interference effects stemming from the discreteness of photon quanta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford hierarchy is a fundamental structure in quantum computation, classifying unitary operators based on their commutation relations with the Pauli group. Despite its significance, the mathematical structure of the hierarchy is not well understood at the third level and higher. In this work, we study permutations in the hierarchy: gates which permute the $2^n$ basis states. We fully characterize all the semi-Clifford permutation gates. Moreover, we prove that any permutation gate in the third level, not necessarily semi-Clifford, must be a product of Toffoli gates in what we define as staircase form, up to left and right multiplications of Clifford permutations. Finally, we show that the smallest number of qubits for which there exists a non-semi-Clifford permutation in the third level is $7$.</description>

      <title>Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yes, we show that they are.
  We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by $k$ separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial $k$. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field using the spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the adiabatic basis, the one-particle distribution function in momentum space is determined by utilizing the exact analytical solution of the Dirac equation. By examining the temporal behavior of the one-particle distribution function and the momentum spectrum of created pairs in the sub-critical field limit $(E_0 = 0.2E_c)$, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum(LMS) of particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, which allows us to explain the origin and behavior of these oscillations. Additionally, we discuss the role of the vacuum polarization function and its counter term to the oscillations in LMS vacuum excitation. We also analyse the transverse momentum spectrum (TMS).</description>

      <title>Symmetry aspects in an ideal Bose gas at thermal equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of ideal gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber's coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. As a direct consequence of thermal equilibrium, the present model describes spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is originally known only from the formal definition of a specific gauge field from Elizur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a continuous physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

Abstract: Ian McGilchrist's works present the thesis that the two hemispheres of the brain have radically different modes of interacting with the world, and that their respective perceptions and functions must be properly integrated for a viable way forward. This proper integration requires restoring the right-brain to its proper place as "Master." I discuss a parallel to this insight in the dichotomous "worlds" of quantum and classical physics. In addition, I discuss the relevance of Whitehead's process philosophy, as well as the Taoist concepts of Yin and Yang, with particular attention to the importance and primacy of Yin underlying the quantum level as "Master."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a close theoretical connection between topological Floquet physics and cavity QED, yet this connection has not been realized experimentally due to complicated cavity QED models that often arise. We propose a simple, experimentally viable protocol to realize non-adiabatic topological photon pumping mediated by a single qubit, which we dub the anomalous Floquet photon pump. For both quantized photons and external drive, the system exhibits a non-trivial topological phase across a broad range of parameter space. Transitions out of the topological phase result from frequency-space delocalization. Finally, we argue that the protocol can be implemented in existing experiments via driven qubit non-linearities, with topological pumping witnessed in measurements of the cavity Wigner distribution functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common feature of the extended phase space of gauge theory, the crossed product of quantum theory, and quantum reference frames (QRFs) is the adjoining of degrees of freedom followed by a constraining procedure for the resulting total system. Building on previous work, we identify non-commutative or quantum geometry as a mathematical framework which unifies these three objects. We first provide a rigorous account of the extended phase space, and demonstrate that it can be regarded as a classical principal bundle with a Poisson manifold base. We then show that the crossed product is a trivial quantum principal bundle which both substantiates a conjecture on the quantization of the extended phase space and facilitates a relational interpretation. Combining several crossed products with possibly distinct structure groups into a single object, we arrive at a novel definition of a quantum orbifold. We demonstrate that change of frame maps within the quantum orbifold correspond to quantum gauge transformations, which are QRF preserving maps between crossed product algebras. Finally, we conclude that the quantum orbifold is equivalent to the G-framed algebra proposed in prior work, thereby placing systems containing multiple QRFs squarely in the context of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical freezing in the thermodynamic limit: the strongly driven ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ergodicity postulate, a foundational pillar of Gibbsian statistical mechanics predicts that a periodically driven (Floquet) system in the absence of any conservation law heats to a featureless `infinite temperature' state. Here, we find--for a clean and interacting generic spin chain subject to a {\it strong} driving field--that this can be prevented by the emergence of {\it approximate but stable} conservation-laws not present in the undriven system. We identify their origin: they do not necessarily owe their stability to familiar protections by symmetry, topology, disorder, or even high energy costs. We show numerically, {\it in the thermodynamic limit,} that when required by these emergent conservation-laws, the entanglement-entropy density of an infinite subsystem remains zero over our entire simulation time of several decades in natural units. We further provide a recipe for designing such conservation laws with high accuracy. Finally, we present an ensemble description, which we call the strongly driven ensemble incorporating these constraints. This provides a way to control many-body chaos through stable Floquet-engineering. Strong signatures of these conservation-laws should be experimentally accessible since they manifest in all length and time scales. Variants of the spin model we have used, have already been realized using Rydberg-dressed atoms.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity: Noise-enhanced Ballistic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in optical measurements enable precise tracking of cavity polariton dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Building on these developments, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of wave packet dynamics in a noisy emitter lattice embedded in a multi-mode microcavity. We uncover a series of dynamic phenomena in both the noise-free and noisy cases: (i) In the noise-free case, the emitters' probability density splits into two Gaussians whose group velocities are defined by the lower and upper polariton branches. (ii) Noise induces dephasing and leads to multiple dynamical stages with different time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. These stages include, in order of increasing duration: underdamped Rabi oscillations; damping of the center of mass velocity of the emitters' probability density; population thermalization; and the transition from the ballistic to the diffusive regimes of the probability density spreading. (iii) Most strikingly, dephasing enhances the ballistic spreading, which persists for several orders of magnitude longer than it does without a cavity. Some of our predictions align with recent experimental observations, while others can be tested in existing platforms. Understanding wave packet dynamics across multiple time scales in the presence of noise is crucial for optimizing polaritonic devices. This study paves the way for future experiments focused on light-matter interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetries from outer automorphisms and unorthodox group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play an essential role in the construction and phenomenology of quantum field theories (QFTs). We discuss how to construct symmetries of QFTs by extending minimal "seed" symmetry groups to larger groups that contain the seed(s) as subgroup(s). On the one hand, there are so-called "normal" extensions, which are given by outer automorphisms of the original symmetry group (including the trivial one) and contain the seed as a normal subgroup. On the other hand, there can be "unorthodox extensions" which do not have this property. We demonstrate our logic on the most general scalar potentials of the two- and three-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM and 3HDM). For the 2HDM, we show that all symmetry groups, including the different possible classes of CP and continuous symmetry groups, can be obtained from extensions of the smallest possible symmetry CP1 by consecutive outer automorphisms. Scanning over normal and unorthodox group extensions might be the easiest way to "machine learn" the possible symmetries of a QFT. However, many of the groups constructible in this way may not be realizable in a concrete model, in the sense that they lead to additional accidental symmetries. Hence, we also comment on a different, "top-down" way to obtain the possible realizable symmetry groups of a QFT based on the covariant transformation of couplings under the most general basis changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical strategy to efficiently solve the out-of-equilibrium Dyson equation in the transient regime. By discretizing the equation into a compact matrix form and applying state-of-the-art matrix compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, which result in quasi-linear scaling of both time and space complexity with propagation time. This enables to compute accurate solutions even for systems with multiple and disparate time scales. We benchmark our solver by simulating a voltage-biased Josephson junction formed by a quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads.</description>

Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

      <title>Pole and zero edge state invariant for 1D non-Hermitian sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach in Ref. [1, 2] uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. The pole-zero approach in Ref. [3] uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</description>

      <title>Route to hyperchaos in quadratic optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperchaos is a qualitatively stronger form of chaos, in which several degrees of freedom contribute simultaneously to exponential divergence of small changes. A hyperchaotic dynamical system is therefore even more unpredictable than a chaotic one, and has a higher fractal dimension. While hyperchaos has been studied extensively over the last decades, only a few experimental systems are known to exhibit hyperchaotic dynamics. Here we introduce hyperchaos in the context of cavity optomechanics, in which light inside an optical resonator interacts with a suspended oscillating mass. We show that hyperchaos can arise in optomechanical systems with quadratic coupling that operate in the resolved-sideband regime by applying a far off-resonance, blue-detuned pump, and is well within reach of current experiments. We compute the two positive Lyapunov exponents, characteristic of hyperchaos, and independently verify the correlation dimension. As systems designed for high-precision measurements, optomechanical systems enable direct measurement of all four dynamical variables and therefore the full reconstruction of the hyperchaotic attractor. Our results may contribute to better understanding of nonlinear systems and the chaos-hyperchaos transition, and allow the study of hyperchaos in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Strong-field resummed heat kernels and effective actions: inhomogeneous fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Quantum Properties and Functionalities of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competing magnetic interactions may stabilize smooth magnetization textures that can be characterized by a topological winding number. Such textures, which are spatially localized within a two-dimensional plane, are commonly known as skyrmions. On the classical level, their significance for fundamental science and their potential for applications, ranging from spintronic devices to unconventional computation platforms, have been intensively investigated in recent years. This Colloquium considers quantum effects associated with skyrmion textures: their theoretical origins, the experimental and material challenges associated with their detection, and the promise of exploiting them for quantum operations. Starting with classical skyrmions, we discuss their magnon and electron excitations and show how hybrid architectures offer new platforms for engineering quantum orders, including topological superconductivity. We then focus on the quantization of the skyrmion texture itself and formulate the long-time skyrmion dynamics in terms of collective coordinates. Next, we discuss the quantization of helicity and phenomena of macroscopic quantum tunneling: key concepts that fundamentally distinguish quantum skyrmions from their classical counterparts. Looking ahead, we propose material classes suitable for the realization of skyrmions in quantum spin systems and identify device architectures with the promise of achieving quantum operations. We close by addressing the advances in experimental methods which will be a prerequisite for resolving the quantum aspects of topological spin patterns, sensing their local dynamical response, and achieving their predicted functionalities in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Cotunneling assisted nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a photosynthetic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a photosystem II-based reaction center modeled as a nonequilibrium quantum junction. We specifically focus on the electron-electron interactions that enable cotunneling events to be captured through quantum mechanical rates due to the inclusion of a negatively charged manybody state. Using a master equation framework with realistic spectral profiles, we analyze the cotunneling assisted current, power, and work. Amplification of the cotunneling assisted current and power occurs over a narrower bias range, reflecting a trade-off where higher flux is compensated by a reduced work window. We further report that the cotunneling-enhanced thermodynamic variables, particularly within specific bias windows, depends on the interplay between cotunneling amplitudes, electron transition rates, and interaction energy. Both attractive and repulsive electronic interactions can enhance cotunneling, but this effect is sensitive to the energy balance between states and the tunneling strength asymmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking suffer from a sign problem that in principle can be evaded through novel methods enabled by quantum computing. Focusing on lower-dimensional lattice systems with more modest resource requirements, in particular the N=1 Wess--Zumino model in 1+1 dimensions, we are exploring ways quantum computing could be used to study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. A particularly promising recent development is to apply the variational quantum deflation algorithm, which generalizes the variational quantum eigensolver so as to resolve multiple low-energy states.</description>

      <title>Spectral function of a bipolaron coupled to dispersive optical phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an efficient variational exact diagonalization method, we computed the electron removal spectral function of a low-doped system within the framework of the Holstein-Hubbard model with dispersive quantum optical phonons. Our primary focus was examining the interplay between phonon dispersion and Coulomb repulsion and their effects on the spectral function in the intermediate to strong electron-phonon coupling regime. Tuning the strengths of the electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the evolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a bound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the decrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift of the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function. Simultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the Brillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the bipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons. The spectral function is significantly influenced by phonon dispersion, particularly in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling. The sign of the curvature of the phonon band plays a crucial role in the distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators: An efficient numerical approach for fermionic path integral simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing numerical exact solvers for open quantum systems is a challenging task due to the non-perturbative and non-Markovian nature when coupling to structured environments. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a powerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems. Numerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic propagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product operator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems with bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the fermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this work, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we introduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and Grassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the single-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical benchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium dynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its application as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a robust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics. It can also serve as an alternative impurity solver to study strongly-correlated quantum matter with dynamical mean-field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Wigner-Yanase skew information, quantum entanglement and spin nematic quantum phase transitions in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY chains with single-ion anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between uniaxial or biaxial spin nematic (SN) phases are investigated in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY infinite chains with the rhombic- and uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropies. Systematic discussions of distinctive singular behaviors are made to classify various types of QPT from one SN state to the other SN state in using the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the quadrupole moments (QMs). For the spin-1 system with the three uniaxial SN phases, we find that a discontinuous QPT, signaled by discontinuous behaviors of all the considered WYSI, BEE, and QMs, occurs from the z-ferroquadrupole phase (FQP) to the x- or y-FQPs, while a continuous QPT occurs between the x- and y-FQPs. The central charge in the continuous QPT line is estimated as $c \simeq 1$ from the BEE. Compared to the spin-1 system, depending on a given strength of the uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropy, the spin-2 system undergoes four different types of QPTs between the two biaxial SN phases as the rhombic-type anisotropy varies: the quantum crossovers, connecting the two orthogonal biaxial SN states adiabatically without an explicit phase transition, the continuous and the discontinuous QPTs, and the SN to magnetic transitions via the antiferromagnetic phase (AFP). In a sharp contrast to the spin-1 system, for the transitions between the two biaxial SN phases, the discontinuous transition line is classified as a topological phase characterized by a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum and a string order parameter defined by the Cartan generator of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry group in spin-2 systems, while the continuous QPT is advocated by the central charge $c \simeq 1$. Whereas the QPT lines with $c \simeq 1/2$ indicate that the transition between the biaxial SN phase and the AFP belongs to the Ising universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) of cryogenic signal lines is a promising technique that can significantly reduce the required space, minimize the cooldown time, and increase the number of measurable quantum devices per cooldown. Here, we report the TDM of supercurrent with a 1-input-8-outputs voltage-actuated hybrid superconducting demultiplexer for the first time. The device comprises 14 ON/OFF InAsOI-based superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) routed with Al traces. Each JoFET features Al as a superconductor and HfO2 as a gate insulator, and it can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal-state resistance by 20 times with a gate voltage of -4.5 V. The superconducting demultiplexer operates up to 100 MHz at 50 mK, features an insertion loss of ~ 0 dB in the superconducting state, and an OFF/ON ratio of ~ 17.5 dB in a 50-Ohm-matched cryogenic measurement setup. The frequency operation range can be extended by designing the demultiplexer with a proper microwave signal transport layout minimizing, at the same time, the impact of the parasitic electrical elements. These achievements open up the practical implementation of superconducting TDM as a key to drastically reducing I/O lines, costs, and space occupation in a cryostat, enabling the scalability of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars are nonthermal eigenstates that prevent thermalization of initial states with weight on the scars. When the scar states are equally spaced in energy, superpositions of scars show oscillating local observables that can be detected in experiments. However, we note that scarred models in the literature show fundamentally different scar entanglement dynamics: some show entanglement oscillations while others are completely frozen. We explain this freezing through a no-go theorem which we apply to more than a dozen scarred models in the literature. We also discuss a method for evading the no-go theorem by deforming the scarred models with frozen scar entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-mode bosonic state with fixed photon number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, whose upper and lower modes pick up a phase $\phi$ and $-\phi$ respectively. We compute the optimal Fock coefficients of the input state, such that the mean square error (MSE) for estimating $\phi$ is minimized while the minimum MSE is always attainable by a measurement. Our setting is Bayesian, i.e., we consider $\phi$ to be a random variable that follows a prior probability distribution function (PDF). Initially, we consider the flat prior PDF and we discuss the well-known fact that the MSE is not an informative tool for estimating a phase when the variance of the prior PDF is large. Therefore, we move on to study truncated versions of the flat prior in both single-shot and adaptive approaches. For our adaptive technique we consider $n=1$ and truncated prior PDFs. Each subsequent step utilizes as prior PDF the posterior probability of the previous step and at the same time we update the optimal state and optimal measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear model for the given problem and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments and covers all the requirements posed by the operator of the network. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. At the same time, the solutions that were obtained were feasible. Moreover, though they are probabilistic (heuristics) they offer a valid alternative by returning a range of possible solutions the dispatcher can choose from. And, most importantly, they outperform classical solvers in some cases.</description>

      <title>Limit Distribution Theory for Quantum Divergences</title>

Abstract: Estimation of quantum relative entropy and its R\'{e}nyi generalizations is a fundamental statistical task in quantum information theory, physics, and beyond. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature along with their computational complexities explored, a limit distribution theory which characterizes the asymptotic fluctuations of the estimation error is still premature. As our main contribution, we characterize these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator version of Taylor's theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed. As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative entropy based on Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that the resulting asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance characterized in terms of the Pauli operators and states. We utilize the knowledge of the aforementioned limit distribution to obtain asymptotic performance guarantees for a multi-hypothesis testing problem.</description>

      <title>Topological Signal Processing on Quantum Computers for Higher-Order Network Analysis</title>

Abstract: Predicting and analyzing global behaviour of complex systems is challenging due to the intricate nature of their component interactions. Recent work has started modelling complex systems using networks endowed with multiway interactions among nodes, known as higher-order networks. SI'implicial complexes are a class of higher-order networks that have received significant attention due to their topological structure and connections to Hodge theory. Topological signal processing (TSP) utilizes these connections to analyze and manipulate signals defined on non-Euclidean domains such as simplicial complexes. In this work, we present a general quantum algorithm for implementing filtering processes in TSP and describe its application to extracting network data based on the Hodge decomposition. We leverage pre-existing tools introduced in recent quantum algorithms for topological data analysis and combine them with spectral filtering techniques using the quantum singular value transformation framework. While this paper serves as a proof-of-concept, we obtain a super-polynomial improvement over the best known classical algorithms for TSP filtering processes, modulo some important caveats about encoding and retrieving the data from a quantum state. The proposed algorithm generalizes the applicability of tools from quantum topological data analysis to novel applications in analyzing high-dimensional complex systems.</description>

      <title>Empirical Risk-aware Machine Learning on Trojan-Horse Detection for Trusted Quantum Key Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that leverages principles of quantum mechanics to offer extremely high levels of data security during transmission. It is well acknowledged for its capacity to accomplish provable security. However, the existence of a gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation has raised concerns about the trustworthiness of QKD networks. In order to mitigate this disparity, we propose the implementation of risk-aware machine learning techniques that present risk analysis for Trojan-horse attacks over the time-variant quantum channel. The trust condition presented in this study aims to evaluate the offline assessment of safety assurance by comparing the risk levels between the recommended safety borderline. This assessment is based on the risk analysis conducted. Furthermore, the proposed trustworthy QKD scenario demonstrates its numerical findings with the assistance of a state-of-the-art point-to-point QKD device, which operates over optical quantum channels spanning distances of 1m, 1km, and 30km. Based on the results from the experimental evaluation of a 30km optical connection, it can be concluded that the QKD device provided prior information to the proposed learner during the non-existence of Eve's attack. According to the optimal classifier, the defensive gate offered by our learner possesses the capability to identify any latent Eve attacks, hence effectively mitigating the risk of potential vulnerabilities. The Eve detection probability is provably bound for our trustworthy QKD scenario.</description>

      <title>Generalised Kochen-Specker Theorem for Finite Non-Deterministic Outcome Assignments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is a cornerstone result in quantum foundations, establishing that quantum correlations in Hilbert spaces of dimension $d \geq 3$ cannot be explained by (consistent) hidden variable theories that assign a single deterministic outcome to each measurement. Specifically, there exist finite sets of vectors in these dimensions such that no non-contextual deterministic ($\{0,1\}$) outcome assignment is possible obeying the rules of exclusivity and completeness - that the sum of value assignments to any $d$ mutually orthogonal vectors be equal to $1$. Another central result in quantum foundations is Gleason's theorem that justifies the Born rule as a mathematical consequence of the quantum formalism. The KS theorem can be seen as a consequence of Gleason's theorem and the logical compactness theorem. Notably, Gleason's theorem also indicates the existence of KS-type finite vector constructions to rule out other finite alphabet outcome assignments beyond the $\{0,1\}$ case. Here, we propose a generalisation of the KS theorem that rules out hidden variable theories with outcome assignments in the set $\{0, p, 1-p, 1\}$ for $p \in [0,1/d) \cup (1/d, 1/2]$. The case $p = 1/2$ is especially physically significant. We show that in this case the result rules out (consistent) hidden variable theories that are fundamentally binary, i.e., theories where each measurement has fundamentally at most two outcomes (in contrast to the single deterministic outcome per measurement ruled out by KS). We present a device-independent application of this generalised KS theorem by constructing a two-player non-local game for which a perfect quantum winning strategy exists (a Pseudo-telepathy game) while no perfect classical strategy exists even if the players are provided with additional no-signaling resources of PR-box type (with marginal probabilities in $\{0,1/2,1\}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We get an exact simulation algorithm which cost scales quadratically with the number of Gaussian states required to represent the initial state and an approximate simulation algorithm which cost scales linearly with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficients associated with the superposition. We define measures of non-Gaussianty quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure and compute optimal decomposition for states relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally study the heating of trapped atomic ions during measurement of their internal qubit states. During measurement, ions are projected into one of two basis states and discriminated by their state-dependent fluorescence. We observe that ions in the fluorescing state rapidly scatter photons and heat at a rate of \mbox{$\dot{\bar{n}}\gtrsim 2\times 10^4$ quanta/s}, which is orders of magnitude faster than typical anomalous ion heating rates. We introduce a quantum trajectory-based framework that accurately reproduces the experimental results and provides a unified description of ion heating for both continuous and discrete sources.</description>

      <title>Constant-depth preparation of matrix product states with adaptive quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that the AKLT state -- a paradigmatic example of an MPS -- can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant-depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith et al., PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming optimal preparation protocols that rely on unitary circuits alone. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a precious global resource in quantum information, genuine tripartite nonlocality(GTN) can be quantified by violating Svetlichny inequality. However, there is still no analytical expression for the general three-qubit states due to the difficulty of theoretical calculations. In this paper, we achieve highly accurate quantization of GTN for arbitrary three-qubit quantum states numerically. As an example, we study the dynamics of GTN and genuine tripartite entanglement(GTE) for the W state. Moreover, the complementarity of GTN is verified by examining the nonlocality between the tripartite and the bipartite. Finally, we also find a useful strategy to protect the correlation of GTN and GTE under decoherence by utilizing the Zeno effect.</description>

Abstract: We explore the application of stabilizer formalism in deriving the two Bloch Sphere representation of pure two-qubit states, including maximally entangled ones. Specifically, we investigate the stabilizer groups of two-qubit states and establish a link with both the density matrix and graphical representation of a given state. The sum of the stabilizer group's matrices constitutes the state's density matrix. Conversely, matrices of a stabilizer group of a given state may be associated with the coordinate axes of the Bloch Spheres representing that state. This analysis reveals a natural link between the density matrix and graphical representations, offering insights into geometry and symmetries of entanglement and two-qubit states in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a bipartite quantum system in an energy eigenstate, the dynamical description for one component can be derived via entanglement using the other component as a clock. This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism. Moreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative time evolution is then described by a Time-Dilated Schr\"odinger equation, in which the so-called Redshift Operator describes a purely quantum effect, analogue to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a non-perturbative approach and present a finite-dimensional generalisation of this mechanism, expressing the quantum time-dilation effect as an effective interaction involving previously non-interacting system components. We name this a Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an example using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is suitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new tool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Method for Simulating Lindblad Equations and Thermal State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \mathcal{L}_a$, where each $\mathcal{L}_a$ involves only a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{t\mathcal{L}_a}$, we implement a randomly sampled $\mathcal{L}_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{\mathcal{L}_a\}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}$. This strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, especially in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators.
  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal state can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Casimir-Lifshitz effect associated with the electromagnetic field in the presence of a rectangular waveguide consisting of two distinct dielectric materials in a $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime. We employ the surface mode technique to derive a generalized Lifshitz formula for this specific geometry. Our formulation accounts for the unique dielectric properties of the materials composing the waveguide, leading to a precise calculation of the Casimir-Lifshitz energy. In the asymptotic limit, our results recover the classical expressions for perfect reflecting boundaries. This work extends the applicability of the Lifshitz formula to more complex systems and provides valuable insights into the influence of dielectric materials on the electromagnetic Casimir effect.</description>

Abstract: We address a combinatorial optimization problem to determine the placement of a predefined number of sensors from multiple candidate positions, aiming to maximize information acquisition with the minimum number of sensors. Assuming that the data from predefined candidates of sensor placements follow a multivariate normal distribution, we defined mutual information (MI) between the data from selected sensor positions and the data from the others as an objective function, and formulated it in a Quadratic Unconstrainted Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem by using a method we proposed. As an example, we calculated optimal solutions of the objective functions for 3 candidates of sensor placements using a quantum annealing machine, and confirmed that the results obtained were reasonable. The formulation method we proposed can be applied to any number of sensors, and it is expected that the advantage of quantum annealing emerges as the number of sensors increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HodgeRank generalizes ranking algorithms, e.g. Google PageRank, to rank alternatives based on real-world (often incomplete) data using graphs and discrete exterior calculus. It analyzes multipartite interactions on high-dimensional networks with a complexity that scales exponentially with dimension. We develop a quantum algorithm that approximates the HodgeRank solution with complexity independent of dimension. Our algorithm extracts relevant information from the state such as the ranking consistency, which achieves a superpolynomial speedup over similar classical methods.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits containing only symmetry-respecting gates. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. These constraints typically include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while 2-qubit gates are semi-universal for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries in qubit systems, SU(d) symmetry with $d\ge 3$ requires 3-qudit gates for semi-universality. Failure of semi-universality precludes the distribution generated by the random circuits from being even a 2-design for the Haar distribution over symmetry-respecting unitaries. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions, satisfied by U(1) and SU(2) for example, the distribution becomes a $t$-design for $t$ growing polynomially with the number of qudits, where the degree is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum integer $t_{\max}$ for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a $t$-design for all $t\leq t_{\max}$. Notably, for U(1), SU(2) and cyclic groups, we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ as a function of the number of qubits and locality of the gates, and for SU(d), we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ for up to $4$-qudit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this communication we demonstrate that a deep artificial neural network based on a transformer architecture with self-attention layers can predict the long-time population dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a dissipative environment provided that the short-time population dynamics of the system is known. The transformer neural network model developed in this work predicts the long-time dynamics of spin-boson model efficiently and very accurately across different regimes, from weak system-bath coupling to strong coupling non-Markovian regimes. Our model is more accurate than classical forecasting models, such as recurrent neural networks and is comparable to the state-of-the-art models for simulating the dynamics of quantum dissipative systems based on kernel ridge regression.</description>

      <title>General theory of constructing potential with bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general theory of potentials that support bound states at positive energies (bound states in the continuum). On the theoretical side, we prove that, for systems described by nonlocal potentials of the form $V(r,r')$, bound states at positive energies are as common as those at negative energies. At the same time, we show that a local potential of the form $V(r)$ rarely supports a positive energy bound state. On the practical side, we show how to construct a (naturally nonlocal) potential which supports an arbitrary normalizable state at an arbitrary positive energy. We demonstrate our theory with numerical examples both in momentum and coordinate spaces with emphasis on the important role played by nonlocal potentials. Finally, we discuss how to observe bound states at positive energies, and where to search for nonlocal potentials which may support them.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Time-Translation-Invariant Systems: Conjugate Symplectic Structure, Uncertainty Bounds, and Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear time-translation-invariant (LTI) models offer simple, yet powerful, abstractions of complex classical dynamical systems. Quantum versions of such models have so far relied on assumptions of Markovianity or an internal state-space description. We develop a general quantization scheme for multimode classical LTI systems that reveals their fundamental quantum noise, is applicable to non-Markovian scenarios, and does not require knowledge of an internal description. The resulting model is that of an open quantum LTI system whose dilation to a closed system is characterized by elements of the conjugate symplectic group. Using Lie group techniques, we show that such systems can be synthesized using frequency-dependent interferometers and squeezers. We derive tighter Heisenberg uncertainty bounds, which constrain the ultimate performance of any LTI system, and obtain an invariant representation of their output noise covariance matrix that reveals the ubiquity of "complex squeezing" in lossy systems. This frequency-dependent quantum resource can be hidden to homodyne and heterodyne detection and can only be revealed with more general "symplectodyne" detection. These results establish a complete and systematic framework for the analysis, synthesis, and measurement of arbitrary quantum LTI systems.</description>

      <title>Commuting Local Hamiltonians Beyond 2D</title>

Abstract: Commuting local Hamiltonians provide a testing ground for studying many of the most interesting open questions in quantum information theory, including the quantum PCP conjecture and the existence of area laws. Although they are a simplified model of quantum computation, the status of the commuting local Hamiltonian problem remains largely unknown. A number of works have shown that increasingly expressive families of commuting local Hamiltonians admit completely classical verifiers. Despite intense work, the largest class of commuting local Hamiltonians we can place in NP are those on a square lattice, where each lattice site is a qutrit. Even worse, many of the techniques used to analyze these problems rely heavily on the geometry of the square lattice and the properties of the numbers 2 and 3 as local dimensions. In this work, we present a new technique to analyze the complexity of various families of commuting local Hamiltonians: guided reductions. Intuitively, these are a generalization of typical reduction where the prover provides a guide so that the verifier can construct a simpler Hamiltonian. The core of our reduction is a new rounding technique based on a combination of Jordan's Lemma and the Structure Lemma. Our rounding technique is much more flexible than previous work, and allows us to show that a larger family of commuting local Hamiltonians is in NP, albiet with the restriction that all terms are rank-1. Specifically, we prove the following two results:
  1. Commuting local Hamiltonians in 2D that are rank-1 are contained in NP, independent of the qudit dimension. Note that this family of commuting local Hamiltonians has no restriction on the local dimension or the locality.
  2. We prove that rank-1, 3D commuting Hamiltonians with qudits on edges are in NP. To our knowledge this is the first time a family of 3D commuting local Hamiltonians has been contained in NP.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is real, $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, and additionally invariant under the symmetry group of the square. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [27, 28]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Symmetry-breaking perturbations and induced band topology are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of fixed-time models in which the commutations relations of a Dirac field with a bosonic field are non-trivial and depend on the choice of a given distribution ("twisting factor"). If the twisting factor is fundamental solution of a differential operator, then applying the differential operator to the bosonic field yields a generator of the local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. Charged vectors generated by the Dirac field define states of the bosonic field which in general are not local excitations of the given reference state. The Hamiltonian density of the bosonic field presents a non-trivial interaction term: besides creating and annihilating bosons, it acts on momenta of fermionic wave functions. When the twisting factor is the Coulomb potential, the bosonic field contributes to the divergence of an electric field and its Laplacian generates local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. In this way we get a fixed-time model fulfilling the equal time commutation relations of the interacting Coulomb gauge.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of creating Bell states in multi-component ultra-cold atomic gases by solely using the ability to control the inter-particle interactions via Feshbach resonances. For this we consider two distinguishable impurities immersed in an atomic background cloud of a few bosons, with the entire system being confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. By analyzing the numerically obtained ground states we demonstrate that the two impurities can form spatially entangled bipolaron states due to mediated interactions from the bosonic bath. Our analysis is based on calculating the correlations between the two impurities in a two-mode basis, which is experimentally accessible by measuring the particles positions in the left or right sides of the trap. While interspecies interactions are crucial in order to create the strongly entangled impurity states, it can also inhibit correlations depending on the ordering of the impurities and three-body impurity-bath correlations. We show how these drawbacks can be mitigated by manipulating the properties of the bath, namely its size, mass and intraspecies interactions, allowing to create impurity Bell states over a wide range of impurity-impurity interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of $\beta^2/2 &lt; 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}$ (90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. Here we extend this approach to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two 1D Bose gases probed by interference. Our analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>
