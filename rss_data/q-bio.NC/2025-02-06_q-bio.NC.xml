      <title>How the Stroop Effect Arises from Optimal Response Times in Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic motivation as constrained entropy maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02962v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Intrinsic motivation" refers to the capacity for intelligent systems to be motivated endogenously, i.e. by features of agential architecture itself rather than by learned associations between action and reward. This paper views active inference, empowerment, and other formal accounts of intrinsic motivation as variations on the theme of constrained maximum entropy inference, providing a general perspective on intrinsic motivation complementary to existing frameworks. The connection between free energy and empowerment noted in previous literature is further explored, and it is argued that the maximum-occupancy approach in practice incorporates an implicit model-evidence constraint.</description>

      <title>SimSort: A Powerful Framework for Spike Sorting by Large-Scale Electrophysiology Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike sorting is an essential process in neural recording, which identifies and separates electrical signals from individual neurons recorded by electrodes in the brain, enabling researchers to study how specific neurons communicate and process information. Although there exist a number of spike sorting methods which have contributed to significant neuroscientific breakthroughs, many are heuristically designed, making it challenging to verify their correctness due to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth labels from real-world neural recordings. In this work, we explore a data-driven, deep learning-based approach. We begin by creating a large-scale dataset through electrophysiology simulations using biologically realistic computational models. We then present \textbf{SimSort}, a pretraining framework for spike sorting. Remarkably, when trained on our simulated dataset, SimSort demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world spike sorting tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our findings underscore the potential of data-driven techniques to enhance the reliability and scalability of spike sorting in experimental neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Brain-Computer Interfaces: AI-powered Decoding Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. This review highlights the core decoding algorithms that enable multimodal BCIs, including a dissection of the elements, a unified view of diversified approaches, and a comprehensive analysis of the present state of the field. We emphasize algorithmic advancements in cross-modality mapping, sequential modeling, besides classic multi-modality fusion, illustrating how these novel AI approaches enhance decoding of brain data. The current literature of BCI applications on visual, speech, and affective decoding are comprehensively explored. Looking forward, we draw attention on the impact of emerging architectures like multimodal Transformers, and discuss challenges such as brain data heterogeneity and common errors. This review also serves as a bridge in this interdisciplinary field for experts with neuroscience background and experts that study AI, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding for AI-powered multimodal BCIs.</description>

      <title>Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.</description>
