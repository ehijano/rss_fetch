      <title>Computation for Epidemic Prediction with Graph Neural Network by Model Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling epidemic events such as COVID-19 cases in both time and space dimensions is an important but challenging task. Building on in-depth review and assessment of two popular graph neural network (GNN)-based regional epidemic forecasting models of \textbf{EpiGNN} and \textbf{ColaGNN}, we propose a novel hybrid graph neural network model, \textbf{EpiHybridGNN}, which integrates the strengths of both EpiGNN and \textbf{ColaGNN}. In the EpiGNN, through its transmission risk encoding module and Region-Aware Graph Learner (RAGL), both multi-scale convolutions and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are combined, aiming to effectively capture spatio-temporal propagation dynamics between regions and support the integration of external resources to enhance forecasting performance. While, in the ColaGNN, a cross-location attention mechanism, multi-scale dilated convolutions, and graph message passing are utilized to address the challenges of long-term forecasting through dynamic graph structures and spatio-temporal feature fusion. Both enjoy respective advantages but also share mutual shortcomings. Our EpiHybridGNN is therefore designed to combine the advantages of both EpiGNN, in its risk encoding and RAGL, and ColaGNN, in its long-term forecasting capabilities and dynamic attention mechanisms. This helps to form a more comprehensive and robust prediction of spatio-temporal epidemic propagation. The computational architecture, core formulas and their interpretations of our proposed EpiHybridGNN are provided. Multiple numerical real data experiments validate that our EpiHybridGNN significantly outperforms both EpiGNN and ColaGNN in epidemic forecasting with comprehensive insights and references offered.</description>

      <title>Convex Clustering Redefined: Robust Learning with the Median of Means Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering approaches that utilize convex loss functions have recently attracted growing interest in the formation of compact data clusters. Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters. By leveraging the robustness of MoM alongside the stability of convex clustering, our method enhances both performance and efficiency, especially on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates weak consistency under specific conditions, while experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of the Expectation Maximization algorithm under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for analysing the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Drawing on recent advances in the theory of gradient flows over Euclidean-Wasserstein spaces, we extend techniques from alternating minimization in Euclidean spaces to the EM algorithm, via its representation as coordinate-wise minimization of the free energy. In so doing, we obtain finite sample error bounds and exponential convergence of the EM algorithm under a natural generalisation of the log-Sobolev inequality. We further show that this framework naturally extends to several variants of EM, offering a unified approach for studying such algorithms.</description>
