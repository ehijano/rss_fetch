      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Thermal masses and trapped-ion quantum spin models: a self-consistent approach to Yukawa-type interactions in the $\lambda\!\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

      <title>Probing the inverse moment of $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude via $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy Ion Collisions: The Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>
