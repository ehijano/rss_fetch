      <title>Compilation for Dynamically Field-Programmable Qubit Arrays with Efficient and Provably Near-Optimal Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays based on neutral atoms have high fidelity and highly parallel gates for quantum computing. However, it is challenging for compilers to fully leverage the novel flexibility offered by such hardware while respecting its various constraints. In this study, we break down the compilation for this architecture into three tasks: scheduling, placement, and routing. We formulate these three problems and present efficient solutions to them. Notably, our scheduling based on graph edge coloring is provably near-optimal in terms of two-qubit gate stage count (at most one more than the optimum), the fidelity bottleneck of this platform. As a result, our compiler, Enola, produces higher fidelity results compared to existing works, e.g., 3.7X stage reduction and 5.9X fidelity improvement on the benchmark set used by OLSQ-DPQA, the current state of the art. Additionally, Enola is highly scalable, e.g., within 30 minutes, it can compile circuits with 10,000 qubits, a scale sufficient for the current era of quantum computing. Enola is open source at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/Enola</description>

      <title>AnalogCoder: Analog Circuit Design via Training-Free Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog circuit design is a significant task in modern chip technology, focusing on the selection of component types, connectivity, and parameters to ensure proper circuit functionality. Despite advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in digital circuit design, the complexity and scarcity of data in analog circuitry pose significant challenges. To mitigate these issues, we introduce AnalogCoder, the first training-free LLM agent for designing analog circuits through Python code generation. Firstly, AnalogCoder incorporates a feedback-enhanced flow with tailored domain-specific prompts, enabling the automated and self-correcting design of analog circuits with a high success rate. Secondly, it proposes a circuit tool library to archive successful designs as reusable modular sub-circuits, simplifying composite circuit creation. Thirdly, extensive experiments on a benchmark designed to cover a wide range of analog circuit tasks show that AnalogCoder outperforms other LLM-based methods. It has successfully designed 20 circuits, 5 more than standard GPT-4o. We believe AnalogCoder can significantly improve the labor-intensive chip design process, enabling non-experts to design analog circuits efficiently. Codes and the benchmark are provided at https://github.com/anonyanalog/AnalogCoder.</description>

      <title>Operational Framework for a Quantum Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Databases are an essential component of modern computing infrastructures and allow efficient access to data stored persistently. Their structure depends on the type and relationships of the stored data elements and on the access pattern. Extending the concept of databases to the quantum domain is expected to increase both the storage efficiency and the access parallelism through quantum superposition. In addition, quantum databases may be seen as the result of a prior state preparation ready to be used by quantum algorithms when needed. On the other hand, limiting factors exist and include entanglement creation, the impossibility of perfect copying due to the no-cloning theorem, and the impossibility of coherently erasing a quantum state. In this work, we introduce quantum databases within the broader context of data structures using classical and quantum data and indexing. In particular, we are interested in quantum databases practical implementation and usability, focusing on the definition of the basic operations needed to create and manipulate data stored in a superposition state. Specifically, we address the case of quantum indexing in combination with classical data. For this scenario, we define the operations for database preparation, extension, removal of indices, writing, and read-out of data, as well as index permutation. We present their algorithmic implementation and highlight their advantages and limitations. Finally, we introduce steps toward defining the same operations in the more general context of quantum indexing and quantum data.</description>

      <title>PriCE: Privacy-Preserving and Cost-Effective Scheduling for Parallelizing the Large Medical Image Processing Workflow over Hybrid Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry and time-consuming task with centralized computing. Outsourcing such medical image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies, yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and monetary cost under user's budget.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Power Management: Challenges and Hints for Securing Future Trusted Execution Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several research groups have introduced innovative hardware designs for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiming to secure applications against potentially compromised privileged software, including the kernel. Since 2017, Tang et al. introduced a new class of software-enabled hardware attacks, which leverages energy management mechanisms. These attacks aim at bypassing TEE security guarantees and exposing sensitive information like cryptographic keys. They have increased in prevalence over the past few years. Despite that, current RISC-V TEE architectures have yet to incorporate them into their threat models. Proprietary implementations, such as Arm TrustZone and Intel SGX, embed countermeasures. However, these countermeasures are not viable in the long term and hinder the capabilities of energy management mechanisms. This article presents the first comprehensive knowledge survey of these attacks, along with an evaluation of literature countermeasures. Our analysis highlights a substantial security gap between assumed threat models and the actual ones, presenting considerable threats in modern systems-on-chip that can undermine even the security guarantees provided by TEEs. We advocate for the enhancement of the next generation of RISC-V TEEs to address these attacks within their threat models, and we believe this study will spur further community efforts in this direction.</description>

      <title>UAV-assisted C-RAN for On-demand Cellular Coverage: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of beyond fifth-generation (5G) infrastructure over disaster-affected regions, temporary hotspot situations (e.g., massive gatherings, etc.), complex terrains (e.g., sea, hills, marshes, etc.) poses numerous challenges for cellular service providers. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as potential candidates to overcome the aforementioned technical issues based on their multi-role capabilities to serve as aerial base stations, mobile relays, and flying wireless access points. As such, the UAVs can act as portable platforms that can be deployed immediately on demand without requiring massive ground infrastructure to support wireless services. This article introduces the integration of UAVs to cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) for beyond 5G applications. The article mainly focuses on the underlying opportunities and challenges to realize the UAV-assisted C-RAN (UC-RAN) architecture in view of three generic application scenarios, i.e., disaster management, hotspots, and complex terrains. A preliminary performance analysis via simulation is further provided for the proposed UC-RAN under hotspot application scenario based on the relevant metrics.</description>

      <title>Full private delegated quantum computing tailored from user to industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a set of private and secure delegated quantum computing protocols and techniques tailored to user-level and industry-level use cases, depending on the computational resources available to the client, the specific privacy needs required, and the type of algorithm. Our protocols are presented at a high level as they are independent of the particular algorithm used for such encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, we propose a method to verify the correct execution of operations by the external server.</description>
