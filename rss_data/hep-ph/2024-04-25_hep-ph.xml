      <title>The Type-I Seesaw family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Type-I Seesaw family of neutrino mass models, including the conventional type-I seesaw and its low-scale variants, namely the linear and inverse seesaws. We establish that all these models essentially correspond to a particular form of the type-I seesaw in the context of explicit lepton number violation. We then focus into the more interesting scenario of spontaneous lepton number violation, systematically categorizing all inequivalent minimal models. Furthermore, we identify and flesh out specific models that feature a rich majoron phenomenology and discuss some scenarios which, despite having heavy mediators and being invisible in processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, predict sizable rates for decays including the majoron in the final state.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey Neutron-Beam Experiment to Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter at the ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$\,eV.</description>

      <title>$\gamma_5$ subtleties in distinct regularizations: the Bumblebee model example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the subtleties of regularization schemes in four-dimensional space ($4S$), related in particular to the introduction of the $\gamma_5$ matrix. To illustrate we use a "Bumblebee" model featuring dynamically induced Lorentz symmetry violation. The analysis centers on how different regularization methods affect the solutions to the gap equation in this model. We highlight the resolution of ambiguities associated with the $\gamma_5$ matrix in ultraviolet divergent integrals by employing an enhanced Implicit Regularization (IREG) method. This method extends IREG to a quasi-four-dimensional space, $Q4S = 4S \oplus X$, drawing parallels with the consistent approach of Dimensional Reduction (DRED). Comparative analysis is conducted against results from the 't Hooft-Veltman regularization scheme, conventional IREG in strict $4S$, and sharp momentum cutoff techniques. Our results illustrate a scheme to compute $\gamma_5$ interactions in physical dimension of divergent amplitudes, confirming the approach in [1].</description>

      <title>Benchmark of deep-inelastic-scattering structure functions at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codes APFEL++ and HOPPET within the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Abnormal threshold behaviors of photo-pion production off the proton in the GZK region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confirmation of the existence of GZK cut-off was tortuous, leading to activities to explore new physics, such as the cosmic-ray new components, unidentified cosmic-ray origins, unknown propagation mechanism, and the modification of fundamental physics concepts like the tiny Lorentz invariance violation (LV). The confirmation of the GZK cut-off provides an opportunity to constrain the LV effect. We use a phenomenological framework to restudy the GZK mechanism under the Planck scale deformation of the proton and pion dispersion relations. Restudying the photon induced pion production of the proton $\mathrm{p}+\gamma\to\mathrm{p}+\pi^0$, we predict abnormal threshold behaviors of this reaction under different LV modifications. Therefore, we can study the LV effects not only from the conventional GZK cut-off, but also from potentially threshold anomalies of the pion production process. We divide the LV parameter space into three regions, and analyze the constraints from current observations in each region. The current observations have set strict constraints on a certain LV region. However, for others LV regions, further experimental observations and theoretical researches are still needed, and we also find survival space for some theoretical explorations that permit specific LV effects.</description>

      <title>Probing Hidden Leptonic Scalar Portals using the NA64 Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the NA64 experiment at CERN SPS to search for New Physics processes involving $e\rightarrow\mu$ transitions after the collision of 100 GeV electrons with target nuclei. A new Dark Sector leptonic portal in which a scalar boson $\varphi$ could be produced in the lepton-flavor-changing bremsstrahlung-like reaction, $eN\rightarrow \mu N\varphi$, is used as benchmark process. In this work, we develop a realistic Monte Carlo simulation of the NA64 experimental setup implementing the differential and total production cross-section computed at exact tree-level and applying the Weisz\"{a}cker-Williams phase space approximation. Using this framework, we investigate the main background sources and calculate the expected sensitivity of the experiment. The results indicate that with minor setup optimization, NA64 can probe a large fraction of the available parameter space compatible with the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the Dark Matter relic predictions in the context of a new Dark Sector leptonic portal with $10^{11}$ EOT. This result paves the way to the exploration of lepton-flavour-changing transitions in NA64.</description>

      <title>Flavor phenomenology of an extended 2HDM with inverse seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed and comprehensive study of several flavor physics observables in both lepton and quark sectors within the framework of an extended 2HDM theory where the inverse seesaw mechanism is implemented to generate the SM fermion mass hierarchy. In that theory, the SM gauge symmetry is supplemented by the local $U(1)_X$ and discrete $Z_4\times Z_2$ groups. In particular, we find that the leptonic flavor observables specifically, the branching ratios of LFV decays $\mu\to e\gamma, \tau\to e(\mu)\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moments $\Delta a_{e(\mu)}$ strongly depend on the couplings of the neutral CP even(odd) Higgses with exotic charged lepton $E_1$, whereas other observables involving BR($l\to 3l'$), Mu-$\overline{\text{Mu}}$ transition and coherent conversion $\mu \to e $ in a muonic atom are predicted to be less than several orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding experimental limits. Regarding the quark sector, the most stringent limits arising from the FCNC process involving the down-type quark $d_a\to d_b$ ($a=1,2,3$) transitions such as BR($\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$), BR$(B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-)$, and meson mixing $ \Delta m_{K,B_s, B_d}$. Considering the obtained constraints from these observables, the new physics contributions to other observables namely BR$(B_s\to \tau^+\mu^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\tau^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\mu^-)$, and FCCC $b\to c$ transition LFUV ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ are shown to be remarkably small. Regarding the observables in the up-type quark transitions, the FCNC top quark processes $t\to u(c)\gamma$ and $t\to u(c)h$ have branching ratios consistent with the experimental limits. Additionally, observables related to SM-like Higgs boson decays BR$(h\to \bar{l}'l)$ and modified couplings $a_{h\bar{f}f}$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings via $\boldsymbol{Z\gamma\,(\ell^+\ell^-\gamma)}$ Production at $\boldsymbol{e^+e^-}$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are absent in the Standard Model (SM) and at the dimension-6 level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), arising first from dimension-8 operators. As such, they provide a unique window for probing new physics beyond the SM. These dimension-8 operators can be mapped to nTGC form factors whose structure is consistent with the spontaneously-broken electroweak gauge symmetry of the SM. In this work, we study the probes of nTGCs in the reaction $e^+e^-\to Z\gamma$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-\,(\ell =e,\mu)$ at an $e^+e^-$ collider. We perform a detector-level simulation and analysis of this reaction at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with collision energy $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV and an integrated luminosity of 5 ab$^{-1}$. We present the sensitivity limits on probing the new physics scales of dimension-8 nTGC operators via measurements of the corresponding nTGC form factors.</description>

      <title>Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory: Rivet version 4 release note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rivet toolkit is the primary mechanism for phenomenological preservation of collider-physics measurements, containing both a computational core and API for analysis implementation, and a large collection of more than a thousand preserved analyses. In this note we summarise the main changes in the new Rivet 4 major release series. These include a major generalisation and more semantically coherent model for histograms and related data objects, a thorough clean-up of inelegant and legacy observable-computation tools, and new systems for extended analysis-data, incorporation of preserved machine-learning models, and serialization for high-performance computing applications. Where these changes introduce backward-incompatible interface changes, existing analyses have been updated and indications are given on how to update new analysis routines and workflows.</description>

      <title>NLO thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation cross sections: a novel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density has been increasingly accurately measured by successive generations of experiments. The Boltzmann equation determines the yields using the dark matter annihilation cross section as one of the inputs; the accurate computation of the latter including thermal contributions thus assumes importance. We report here the next-to-leading order (NLO) thermal corrections to the cross sections for (Majorana) dark matter annihilation to standard model fermions: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$, via charged scalars. We use a novel approach, utilising the technique of Grammer and Yennie, extended to thermal field theories, where the cancellation of soft infra-red divergences occurs naturally. We present the NLO thermal cross sections in full detail for both the relativistic case as well as in the non-relativistic limit. Our independent calculation verifies earlier results where the leading contribution at order ${\cal{O}}(T^2)$ was shown to be proportional to the square of the fermion mass in the non-relativistic limit, just as at leading order. We find that the ${\cal{O}}(T^4)$ contributions have the same dependence on the fermion mass as well.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in particle physics: from nuclear isospin to the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise pedagogic introduction to group representation theory motivated by the historical developments surrounding the advent of the Eightfold Way. Abstract definitions of groups and representations are avoided in favour of the physical intuition of symmetries of the nuclear interaction. The concept of nuclear isospin is used as a physical motivation to introduce SU(2) and discuss the main techniques of representation theory. The discovery of strange particles motivates extending the symmetry group to SU(3), at first in the context of the Sakata model. We highlight the successes in fitting mesons in the SU(3) octet, discuss the drawbacks of the Sakata model for baryonic classifications, and how the Eightfold Way finally led to the quark model. This approach has two major advantages: (i) the main concepts of the theory of Lie groups are introduced and discussed without ever losing touch with its applications in particle physics; (ii) it allows the beginner to study group theory while also becoming acquainted with the historical developments of particle physics that led to the concept of quarks. In particular, in this pedagogical path the quarks appear as yet another class of particles predicted from symmetry principles, rather than being introduced ad hoc for postulating an SU(3) symmetry, as usually done in the literature.</description>

      <title>A mechanism relating the fermionic mass hierarchy to the flavor mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the hierarchical structure of fermionic masses and the fermionic flavor mixing puzzles in the Standard Model, we propose to relate them by the see-saw mechanism, i.e. only the third generation of quarks and charged leptons achieve the masses at the tree level, the first two generations achieves masses through the mixings with the third generation, and the neutrinos achieve tiny Majorana masses by the so-called Type-I see-saw mechanism. This new picture at the fermion sector can explain simultaneously the flavor mixing puzzle and mass hierarchy puzzle in the SM. In addition, a flavor-dependent model (FDM) is proposed to realize the new mechanism, and observing the top quark rare decay processes $t\to ch$, $t\to uh$ and the lepton flavor violation processes $\mu\to3e,\;\tau\to3e,\;\mu\to3\mu$ is effective to test the proposed FDM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss matters related to the point that topological quantization in the strong interaction is a consequence of an infinite spacetime volume. Because of the ensuing order of limits, i.e. infinite volume prior to summing over topological sectors, CP is conserved. Here, we show that this reasoning is consistent with the construction of the path integral from steepest-descent contours. We reply to some objections that aim to support the case for CP violation in the strong interactions that are based on the role of the CP-odd theta-parameter in three-form effective theories, the correct sampling of all configurations in the dilute instanton gas approximation and the volume dependence of the partition function. We also show that the chiral effective field theory derived from taking the volume to infinity first is in no contradiction with analyses based on partially conserved axial currents.</description>

      <title>Axions in the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, which is motivated from Swampland principles and predicts a single micron scale extra dimension, suggests a consistent framework for the dark sector of the universe. We consider the implications of this scenario for the QCD axion. We find that in the scenario in which the axion is localized on the standard model brane (which we will argue is natural), a combination of theoretical (being bounded by the 5D Planck mass) and observational constraints forces it to have decay constant in a narrow range $f \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$ GeV. This corresponds to a mass for the QCD axion of $m_a \sim (1 - 10)$ meV. The axion mass surprisingly coincides with the mass scale for the dark energy, the dark matter tower, and the neutrinos. In this scenario axions are not expected to form a large fraction of the dark matter but nevertheless this range of axion parameters is accessible to observations in near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors for Nucleons in Short-Range Correlations and the EMC effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between medium modifications of nucleon electromagnetic form factors and nucleon structure functions is examined using a model motivated by Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD). These modifications are closely connected with the influence of short-ranged correlations. The size of the modifications to nucleon form factors is shown to be about the same as the modifications to the structure functions. Thus, small limits on form factors modifications do not rule out an explanation of the EMC effect motivated by the influence of short range correlations, as claimed by a recent paper.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy equations of state in $F(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the acceleration of the Universe's expansion in $F(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of energy-momentum tensor. Indeed, the unknown nature of the source controlling this acceleration in general relativity leads scientists to investigate its properties by means of some alternative theories to general relativity. Our study is restricted to the particular case where $F(R,T)=R+2\kappa^2 \lambda T$ , with $\lambda$ being a constant. We use a Bayesian analysis of current observational datasets, including the type Ia supernovae constitution compilation and $H(z)$ measurements, to constrain free parameters of the model. To parametrize dark energy, we consider two well known equations of state. We find the best fit values for each model by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo technic. The best fit parameters are used to compare both models to $\Lambda$CDM by means of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. We show that the Universe underwent recently a transition from a deceleration to an acceleration for both models. Furthermore, the data shows a phantom nature of the equation of state for both models.</description>

      <title>The Coupling Constant of the Pseudovector Pion-nucleon Interaction for the Magnetic Moment of Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of the suppression of the coupling constant in the pseudovector pion-nucleon interaction is examined to account for the calculation of the magnetic moment of nucleon. Among three kinds of the higher-order corrections the vacuum polarization of the pion propagator contributes to the numerical value considerably. On the other hand the lowest-order vertex correction for the pion-nucleon-nucleon vertex does not give large effect in the approximation of the on-shell momenta for nucleons.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of spatial correlators of light and heavy mesons in high temperature lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial $z$-correlators of meson operators in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall quarks at the physical point are studied for seven temperatures in the range of 190-1540 MeV. The meson operators include a complete set of Dirac bilinears (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, tensor vector, and axial-tensor vector), and each for six flavor combinations ($\bar u d$, $\bar u s$, $\bar s s$, $\bar u c$, $\bar s c$, and $\bar c c$). In Ref. \cite{Chiu:2023hnm}, we focused on the meson correlators of $u$ and $d$ quarks, and discussed their implications for the effective restoration of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ chiral symmetries, as well as the emergence of approximate $SU(2)_{CS}$ chiral spin symmetry. In this work, we extend our study to meson correlators of six flavor contents, and first observe the hierarchical restoration of chiral symmetries in QCD, from $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A $ to $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_A $, and to $SU(4)_L \times SU(4)_R \times U(1)_A $, as the temperature is increased from 190 MeV to 1540 MeV. Moreover, we compare the temperature windows for the emergence of the approximate $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry in light and heavy vector mesons, and find that the temperature windows are dominated by the $(\bar u c, \bar s c, \bar c c)$ sectors.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on U(1)' Models: from Non-Standard Interactions to Long-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of gauge bosons from a weakly coupled lepton flavor dependent $U(1)'$ interaction on the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos in the global analysis of oscillation data. The analysis is performed for interaction lengths ranging from the Sun-Earth distance to effective contact neutrino interactions. We survey $\sim 10000$ set of models characterized by the six relevant fermion $U(1)'$ charges and find that in all cases, constraints on the coupling and mass of the $Z'$ can be derived. We also find that about 5% of the $U(1)'$ model charges lead to a viable LMA-D solution but this is only possible in the contact interaction limit. We explicitly quantify the constraints for a variety of models including $U(1)_{B-3L_e}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{B-\frac{3}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, $U(1)_{L_e-L_\tau}$, $U(1)_{L_e-\frac{1}{2}(L_\mu+L_\tau)}$. We compare the constraints imposed by our oscillation analysis with the strongest bounds from fifth force searches, violation of equivalence principle as well as bounds from scattering experiments and white dwarf cooling. Our results show that generically, the oscillation analysis improves over the existing bounds from gravity tests for $Z'$ lighter than $\sim 10^{-8} \to 10^{-11}$ eV depending on the specific couplings. In the contact interaction limit, we find that for most models listed above there are values of $g'$ and $M_{Z'}$ for which the oscillation analysis provides constraints beyond those imposed by laboratory experiments. Finally we illustrate the range of $Z'$ and couplings leading to a viable LMA-D solution for two sets of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric reheating is a generic requirement for models of dark sectors with light species, but its implementation is usually in tension with unique phenomenologies otherwise possible in compelling theories containing dark copies of the Standard Model. We present a simple module to implement asymmetric reheating during a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking phase above some critical temperature. This reinvigorates the possibility of an exactly degenerate mirror sector and the striking phenomenology of composite particles oscillating into their mirror counterparts.</description>

      <title>SMEFiT: a flexible toolbox for global interpretations of particle physics data with effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a robust framework to interpret experimental measurements in the context of new physics scenarios while minimising assumptions on the nature of the underlying UV-complete theory. We present the Python open source SMEFiT framework, designed to carry out parameter inference in the SMEFT within a global analysis of particle physics data. SMEFiT is suitable for inference problems involving a large number of EFT degrees of freedom, without restrictions on their functional dependence in the fitted observables, can include UV-inspired restrictions in the parameter space, and implements arbitrary rotations between operator bases. Posterior distributions are determined from two complementary approaches, Nested Sampling and Monte Carlo optimisation. SMEFiT is released together with documentation, tutorials, and post-analysis reporting tools, and can be used to carry out state-of-the-art EFT fits of Higgs, top quark, and electroweak production data. To illustrate its functionalities, we reproduce the results of the recent ATLAS EFT interpretation of Higgs and electroweak data from Run II and demonstrate how equivalent results are obtained in two different operator bases.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP Violation beyond the Standard Model and the PQ Quality with Electric Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), one of the leading low energy consequences of the model appears in the form of the chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) of the gluons and light quarks. We examine if these CEDMs can be distinguished from the QCD $\theta$-term through the experimentally measurable nucleon and atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in both cases with and without the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism solving the strong CP problem. We find that the nucleon EDMs can show a distinctive pattern when the EDMs are dominantly induced by light quark CEDMs without the PQ mechanism. In the presence of the PQ mechanism, the nucleon EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have a similar pattern as those due to the QCD $\theta$-parameter, regardless of the origin of the axion vacuum value which determines the $\theta$-parameter. In contrast, diamagnetic atomic EDMs due to the gluon or light quark CEDMs have characteristic patterns distinguishable from the pattern due to the $\theta$-parameter which is induced dominantly by UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly, for instance by quantum gravity effects. Our results suggest that EDMs may provide information not only on CP violation beyond the SM, but also on the existence of the PQ mechanism and the quality of the PQ symmetry characterized by the strength of UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly.</description>

      <title>Predictions from scoto-seesaw with $A_4$ modular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper's novelty lies in introducing a hybrid scoto-seesaw model rooted in $A_4$ discrete modular symmetry leading to several interesting phenomenological implications. The scoto-seesaw framework leads to generation of one mass square difference $( \Delta m^2_{\rm atm}$) using the type-I seesaw mechanism at the tree level. Additionally, the scotogenic contribution is vital in obtaining the other mass square difference ($\Delta m^2 _{\rm sol}$) at the loop level, thus providing a clear interpretation of the two different mass square differences. The non-trivial transformation of Yukawa couplings under the $A_4$ modular symmetry helps to explore neutrino phenomenology with a specific flavor structure of the mass matrix. In addition to predictions for neutrino mass ordering, mixing angles and CP phases, this setup leads to precise predictions for $\sum m_i$ as well as $|m_{ee}|$. In particular, the model predicts $\sum m_i \in (0.073,0.097)$ eV and $\left| m_{ee}\right| \in (3.15,6.66)\times 10^{-3} $ eV range; within reach of upcoming experiments. Furthermore, our model is also promising for addressing lepton flavor violations, i.e., $\ell_\alpha \to \ell_\beta \gamma$, $\ell_\alpha \to 3\ell_\beta$ and $\mu - e $ conversion rates while staying within the realm of current experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Importance of cosmic ray propagation on sub-GeV dark matter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that may annihilate or decay into SM particles producing an exotic injection component in the Milky Way that leaves an imprint in both photon and cosmic ray (CR) fluxes. Specifically, the DM particles may annihilate or decay into $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $\pi^+\pi^-$ and may radiate photons through their $e^\pm$ products. The resulting $e^\pm$ products can be directly observed in probes such as {\sc Voyager 1}. Alternatively, the $e^\pm$ products may produce bremsstrahlung radiation and upscatter the low-energy galactic photon fields via the inverse Compton process generating a broad emission from $X$-ray to $\gamma$-ray energies observable in experiments such as {\sc Xmm-Newton}. We find that we get a significant improvement in the DM annihilation and decay constraints from {\sc Xmm-Newton} (excluding thermally averaged cross sections of $10^{-31}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1} \lesssim \langle \sigma v\rangle \lesssim10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and decay lifetimes of $10^{26} \textrm{s}\lesssim \tau \lesssim 10^{28} \textrm{s}$ respectively) by including best fit CR propagation and diffusion parameters. This yields the strongest astrophysical constraints for this mass range of DM of 1 MeV to a few GeV and even surpasses cosmological bounds across a wide range of masses as well.</description>

      <title>The recursive structure of Baikov representations II: the top-down reduction with intersection theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following our previous study of the recursive structure of Baikov representations, we discuss its application in the integration-by-parts reduction of Feynman integrals. We combine the top-down reduction approach with the recursive structure, which can greatly simplify the calculation for each sector in many cases. We introduce a new concept called the top-sector ISP reduction, which generalizes the maximal-cut reduction by retaining the sub-sector information. After subtracting the top-sector components, we provide a general method to transform the remaining integrand explicitly to sub-sectors, such that the reduction procedure can be carried out recursively. In this work, we use the intersection theory to demonstrate our method, although it can be applied to any implementation of the integration-by-parts reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study di-Higgs production via gluon fusion at the high luminosity LHC in the presence of new physics, focusing on the $b\bar b\gamma\gamma$ final states. Taking a minimal set of three scalar leptoquarks (LQs) with cubic and quartic interactions with the Higgs and choosing four benchmark points with a light LQ, we perform a detailed analysis of differential distributions of the di-Higgs production cross section, studying the imprints of the new physics states running in the loops. Simulating the signal and main backgrounds, we study the influence of the new physics in differential distributions such as the invariant mass of the subsystems of final particles, the transverse momentum, and angular variables, finding in particular a resonance peak associated with the light LQ. It turns out that the angular separation of the photons, which is correlated with the resonance LQ peak, is a very sensitive observable that helps in discriminating the new physics signal from the Standard Model background. We find that for two of our benchmarks discovery could be reached with 3 ab$^{-1}$, whereas exclusion limits at 95% C.L. could be claimed with 0.60-0.75 ab$^{-1}$. For the other two benchmarks that have heavier LQ masses significances of order 2$\sigma$ are possible for 3 ab$^{-1}$. A similar analysis could be applied to other loop-enhanced models.</description>

      <title>Spinning Pairs: Supporting $^3P_0$ Quark-Pair Creation from Landau Gauge Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abundant phenomenology suggests that strong decays from relatively low-excitation hadrons into other hadrons proceed by the creation of a light quark-antiquark pair with zero total angular momentum, the so called $^3P_0$ mechanism originating from a scalar bilinear. Yet the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) interaction is perturbatively mediated by gluons of spin one, and QCD presents a chirally symmetric Lagrangian. Such scalar decay term must be spontaneously generated upon breaking chiral symmetry. We attempt to reproduce this with the help of the quark-gluon vertex in Landau gauge, whose nonperturbative structure has been reasonably elucidated in the last years, and insertions of a uniform, constant chromoelectric field. This is akin to Schwinger pair production in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and we provide a comparison with its two field-insertions diagram. We find that, the symmetry being cylindrical, the adequate quantum numbers to discuss the production are rather $^3\Sigma_0$, $^3\Sigma_1$ and $^3\Pi_0$ as in diatomic molecules, and we indeed find a sizeable contribution of the third decay mechanism, which may give a rationale for the $^3P_0$ phenomenology, as long as the momentum of the produced pair is at or below the scale of the bare or dynamically generated fermion mass. On the other hand, ultrarelativistic fermions are rather ejected with $^3\Sigma_1$ quantum numbers. In QED, our results suggest that $^3\Sigma_0$ dominates, whereas the constraint of producing a color singlet in QCD leads to $^3\Pi_0$ dominance at sub-GeV momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal plasma filling the early universe generated a stochastic gravitational wave background that peaks in the microwave frequency range today. If the graviton production rate is expressed as a series in a fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and the temperature over the Planck mass, $T^2_{ } / m_{\rm pl}^2$, then the lowest-order contributions come from single ($\sim \alpha T^2_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^2$) and double ($\sim T^4_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^4$) graviton production via $2\to 2$ scatterings. We show that in the Standard Model, single-graviton production dominates if the maximal temperature is smaller than $4\times 10^{18}_{ }$ GeV. This justifies previous calculations which relied solely on single-graviton production. We mention Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in which the single and double-graviton contributions could be of comparable magnitudes. Finally, we elaborate on what these results imply for the range of applicability of General Relativity as an effective theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite mass of the heavy quark suppresses the collimated radiations, which is generally referred to as the dead cone effect. In this paper, we study the distribution of hadron multiplicity over the hadron opening angle with respect to the jet axis in various flavors of jets. The corresponding measurement can be the most straightforward and simplest to explore the dynamical evolution of the radiations in the corresponding jet, which can expose the mass effect. We also propose the transverse energy-weighted angular distribution which sheds light on the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects in the radiation. With Monte-Carlo simulations, our calculation shows that the dead cone effect can be clearly seen by taking the ratio between the b jet and the light-quark (inclusive) jet, promising to be measured at the LHC in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $J/\psi \to \phi \pi^+ a_0(980)^- (a_0^- \to \pi^- \eta)$ decay, evaluating the double mass distribution in terms of the $\pi^- \eta$ and $\pi^+ a^-_0$ invariant masses. We show that the $\pi^- \eta$ mass distribution exhibits the typical cusp structure of the $a_0(980)$ seen in recent high statistics experiments, and the $\pi^+ a^-_0$ spectrum shows clearly a peak around $M_{\rm inv}(\pi^+ a^-_0)=1420 \,{\rm MeV}$, corresponding to a triangle singularity. When integrating over the two invariant masses we find a branching ratio for this decay of the order of $10^{-5}$, which is easily accessible in present laboratories. We also call attention to the fact that the signal obtained is compatible with a bump experimentally observed in the $\eta \pi^+\pi^-$ mass distribution in the $J/\psi \to \phi \eta \pi^+\pi^-$ decay and encourage further analysis to extract from there the $\phi \pi^+ a_0^-$ and $\phi \pi^- a_0^+$ decay modes.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Is Doublet-Triplet Splitting Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that it is not necessary to substantially break the mass degeneracy between the Standard Model Higgs boson doublet and the corresponding scalar leptoquark, where these two fields comprise a single five-dimensional $SU(5)$ representation. More precisely, we show that the experimental data on partial proton decay lifetimes cannot place any meaningful bound on the mass of the scalar leptoquark, a.k.a. the color triplet, if one includes effects of higher-dimensional operators within the Georgi-Glashow model. We also point out that the complete suppression of proton decay via the scalar leptoquark mediation is compatible with the partial suppression of the gauge mediated two-body proton decay signatures. Finally, we derive a proper limit on the cutoff scale of the aforementioned higher-dimensional operators and outline how this scenario could be tested.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrarelativistic Vortex Leptons with Large Orbital Angular Momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic vortex leptons with intrinsic orbital angular momenta (OAM) have important applications in high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, etc. However, unfortunately, their generation still poses a great challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for generating ultrarelativistic vortex positrons and electrons through nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) scattering of vortex $\gamma$ photons. For the first time, a complete angular momentum-resolved scattering theory has been formulated, introducing the angular momentum of laser photons and vortex particles into the conventional NBW scattering framework. We find that vortex positron (electron) can be produced when the outgoing electron (positron) is generated along the collision axis. By unveiling the angular momentum transfer mechanism, we clarify that OAM of the $\gamma$ photon and angular momenta of multiple laser photons are entirely transferred to the generated pairs, leading to the production of ultrarelativistic vortex positrons or electrons with large OAM. Furthermore, we find that the cone opening angle and superposition state of the vortex $\gamma$ photon, distinct characteristics aside from its intrinsic OAM, can be determined via the angular distribution of created pairs in NBW processes. Our method paves the way for investigating strong-field quantum electrodynamics processes concerning the generation and detection of vortex particle beams in intense lasers.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and Fermionic Holographic Fluctuation and Dissipation at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some general aspects of fluctuation and dissipation in the holographic scenario at zero and finite density. We model this situation with a probe string in a diagonal metric representing a black brane. The string stretches from the black brane to a probe brane thus simulating a stochastic driven particle. In this scenario, we compute the admittance, the diffusion coefficient, the correlation functions and the regularized mean square displacement, for bosons and fermions, all from the metric components. We check these calculations with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we show that at finite temperature and density, the mean square displacement in the limit of short times reproduces the usual quadratic (ballistic) behavior, for bosons and fermions. For large times, we find ultraslow diffusive processes in various cases, except for bosons at zero chemical potential. We apply this general analysis in two different models: hyperscaling violation at finite temperature and a charged dilatonic AdS black hole, both for bosons and fermions. This is important because we found the fermionic diffusion in systems which allow the appearance of Fermi surfaces and Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Experimental Limits on Solar Reflected Dark Matter with a New Approach on Accelerated-Dark-Matter-Electron Analysis in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a dark matter-electron (DM-electron) paradigm has drawn much attention. Models beyond the standard halo model describing DM accelerated by high energy celestial bodies are under intense examination as well. In this Letter, a velocity components analysis (VCA) method dedicated to swift analysis of accelerated DM-electron interactions via semiconductor detectors is proposed and the first HPGe detector-based accelerated DM-electron analysis is realized. Utilizing the method, the first germanium based constraint on sub-GeV solar reflected DM-electron interaction is presented with the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day dataset from the CDEX-10 experiment. In the heavy mediator scenario, our result excels in the mass range of 5$-$15 keV/$c^2$, achieving a 3 orders of magnitude improvement comparing with previous semiconductor experiments. In the light mediator scenario, the strongest laboratory constraint for DM lighter than 0.1 MeV/$c^2$ is presented. The result proves the feasibility and demonstrates the vast potential of the VCA technique in future accelerated DM-electron analyses with semiconductor detectors.</description>

      <title>On Q-balls in Anti de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a general analysis of thin-wall Q-balls in AdS space. We provide numeric solutions and highly accurate analytic approximations over much of the parameter space. These analytic solutions show that AdS Q-balls exhibit significant differences from the corresponding flat space solitons. This includes having a maximum radius beyond which the Q-balls are unstable to a new type of state where the Q-ball coexists with a gas of massive particles. The phase transition to this novel state is found to be a zero-temperature third-order transition. This, through the AdS/CFT correspondence, has implications for a scalar condensate in the boundary theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11151v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the bound state problem for Varshni-Hellmann potential via a useful technique. In our technique, we obtain the bound state solution of the Schrodinger equation for the Varshni-Hellmann potential via ansatz method. We obtain the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigen-functions. Also, the behavior of the energy spectra for both the ground and the excited state of the two body systems is illustrated graphically. The similarity of our results to the accurate numerical values is indicative of the efficiency of our technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that the energy and the enthalpy densities can be smeared by two fudge factors that are constrained by the contracted Bianchi identities. Depending on the analytic properties of the smearing functions the underlying cosmological solutions belong to two physically different classes, namely the bounces of the scale factor and the curvature bounces. While the curvature bounces are naturally compatible with a stage of accelerated expansion, the bounces of the scale factor demand an early phase of accelerated contraction even if a short inflationary stage may arise prior to the decelerated regime. Despite the regularity of the underlying solutions, gradient instabilities and singularities do occasionally appear in the evolution of curvature inhomogeneities. After deducing the specific criteria behind these occurrences, the background-independent conclusions are corroborated by a series of concrete examples associated with different forms of the smearing functions. The evolution of the curvature inhomogeneities restricts the ranges of the solutions that turn out to be unsuitable even for a limited description of the pre-inflationary initial data. The same observation holds in the case of the gauge-invariant evolution of the matter density contrast. It is however not excluded that a class of scenarios (mainly associated with the curvature bounces) could indeed avoid the potential instabilities. All in all the present analysis explore a general approach whose results are relevant in all the contexts where bouncing solutions are invoked either as complementary or as alternative to the conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the modified L\"uscher equation in the presence of the long-range force caused by the exchange of a light particle. It is shown that the use of this equation enables one to circumvent the problems related to the strong partial-wave mixing and the t-channel sub-threshold singularities. It is also demonstrated that the present method is intrinsically linked to the so-called modified effective-range expansion (MERE) in the infinite volume. A detailed comparison with the two recently proposed alternative approaches is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the scalar potential in the Litim-Sannino model. We compute for the first time the full quantum corrections to the classical potential and show that they significantly ameliorate the stability analysis at the UV fixed point. The quantum effective potential is computed at two-loop order and the numerical precision is further improved using resummations and parameter optimisations. As a result, we find a consistent widening of the UV conformal window across various approximations.</description>
