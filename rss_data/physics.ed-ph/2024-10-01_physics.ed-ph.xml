      <title>Astronomy Identity Framework for Undergraduate Students and Researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research was a qualitative transcendental phenomenological exploration of astronomy identity formation among astronomy majors and physics majors engaged in astronomy research. Participants (N=10), all of whom identified with traditionally marginalized groups in astronomy, were recruited from two large universities in New York State at different stages in their undergraduate careers. Social cognitive career theory and the physics identity framework conceptually guided the analysis of astronomy identity for undergraduate majors and undergraduate astronomy researchers by exploring participants interest in, choice to study, and persistence in astronomy. Themes related to astronomy interest were popular culture and directly observing astronomical phenomena, while astronomy choice and persistence were facilitated by experiences in introductory coursework, recognition from faculty, and socializing with peers. The emergent astronomy identity framework was characterized by six distinct yet interrelated constructs: 1) interest, typically rooted in observing naturally occurring phenomena and engaging with popular culture; 2) recognition from peers, experts, and families; 3) peer socialization; 4) competence; 5) sense of belonging; and 6) astronomy career expectations. Implications from this research provide insights on factors that influence undergraduates in four-year colleges to study astronomy, and how students' past experiences lead to a natural interest in astronomy that may be fostered in secondary and post-secondary contexts. Findings suggest departments and institutions may facilitate the accessibility of astronomy at the collegiate level by promoting a more inclusive astronomy community, fostering interactions with astronomy faculty and graduate students, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, and communicating expectancy for astronomy-related future careers.</description>

      <title>The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics: Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers that we intend to publish about the epistemology of fundamental physics in its current state. One of the main objectives of these papers is to improve our understanding of fundamental physics (and modern physics in particular) from an epistemological and interpretative perspective (i.e. versus formal perspective). Another main objective is to investigate and assess the merit of searching for a unified physical theory (the so-called ``theory of everything'') considering the fact that contemporary physics is a collection of theories created and developed by different individuals and groups of scientists in different eras of history reflecting different levels of scientific, philosophical and epistemological development and dealing with largely separate physical phenomena and hence such unification may mean ``stitching together'' an inhomogeneous collection of theoretical structures which may be clumsy (if not impossible) at least from an epistemological viewpoint.</description>
