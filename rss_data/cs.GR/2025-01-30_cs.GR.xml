      <title>A Survey on Quality Metrics for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-based text-to-image models do not only excel at generating realistic images, they also give designers more and more fine-grained control over the image content. Consequently, these approaches have gathered increased attention within the computer graphics research community, which has been historically devoted towards traditional rendering techniques, that offer precise control over scene parameters (e.g., objects, materials, and lighting). While the quality of conventionally rendered images is assessed through well established image quality metrics, such as SSIM or PSNR, the unique challenges of text-to-image generation require other, dedicated quality metrics. These metrics must be able to not only measure overall image quality, but also how well images reflect given text prompts, whereby the control of scene and rendering parameters is interweaved. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of such text-to-image quality metrics, and propose a taxonomy to categorize these metrics. Our taxonomy is grounded in the assumption, that there are two main quality criteria, namely compositional quality and general quality, that contribute to the overall image quality. Besides the metrics, this survey covers dedicated text-to-image benchmark datasets, over which the metrics are frequently computed. Finally, we identify limitations and open challenges in the field of text-to-image generation, and derive guidelines for practitioners conducting text-to-image evaluation.</description>

      <title>TinkerXR: In-Situ, Reality-Aware CAD and 3D Printing Interface for Novices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing accessibility of augmented reality (AR) for visualization, existing computer-aided design (CAD) systems remain confined to traditional screens or require complex setups or predefined parameters, limiting immersion and accessibility for novices. We present TinkerXR, an open-sourced interface enabling in-situ design and fabrication through Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling. TinkerXR operates solely with a headset and 3D printer, allowing users to design directly in and for their physical environments. By leveraging spatial awareness, depth occlusion, recognition of physical constraints, reference objects, and intuitive hand movement controls, TinkerXR enhances realism, precision, and ease of use. Its AR-based workflow integrates design and 3D printing with a drag-and-drop interface for a 3D printer's virtual twin. A user study comparing TinkerXR with Tinkercad demonstrates higher accessibility, engagement, and ease of use for novices. By bridging the gap between digital creation and physical output, TinkerXR transforms everyday spaces into accessible and expressive creative studios.</description>

      <title>Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</description>
