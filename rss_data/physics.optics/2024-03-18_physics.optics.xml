      <title>Subharmonic lock-in detection and its optimisation for femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although often viewed as detrimental, fluctuations carry valuable information about the physical system from which they emerge. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) has recently been established to probe the ultrafast fluctuation dynamics of thermally populated magnons by measurement of their amplitude autocorrelation. Subharmonic lock-in detection is the key technique in this method, allowing to extract the pulse-to-pulse polarisation fluctuations of two femtosecond optical pulse trains transmitted through a magnetic sample. Here, we present a thorough technical description of the subharmonic demodulation technique and of the FemNoC measurement system. We mathematically model the data acquisition process and identify the essential parameters which critically influence the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals. Comparing the model calculations to real datasets allows validating the predicted parameter dependences and provides a means to optimise FemNoC experiments.</description>

      <title>Area theorem for surface plasmons interacting of with resonant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the area theorem is applicable to the analytical description of the nonlinear interaction of surface plasmon modes with resonant two-level atoms. A closed analytical solution is obtained, which shows that surface plasmons can form long-propagating $2\pi$ pulses when interacting with an optically dense two-level atomic ensemble. The possible applications of the surface pulse area theorem and the conditions for the detection of $2\pi$ surface plasmon pulses are discussed.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity and large scanning range optical antennas enabled by multi-casting ridge-waveguide subwavelength structure arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large-scale integrated photonics, optical phased array (OPA) is an effective way to realize highly integrated, stable and low-cost beam control system. Achieving a large field of view (FOV) in the longitudinal direction without increasing fabrication cost and system complexity is still a significant challenge in OPA antennas. Here, a high sensitivity and large scanning range antenna based on subwavelength structure array is proposed to enhance the longitudinal scanning and free-space radiating efficiency by using the ridge-waveguide structure and backward-emitting. A millimeter-long grating antenna with a far-field beam divergence of 0.13{\deg} and a wavelength sensitivity of 0.237{\deg}/nm is experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, by using different sideband periods, we introduce a multi-casting grating antenna with a large scanning range up to 42.6{\deg}. The proposed devices show significant improvement in longitudinal wavelength sensitivity compared with the typical waveguide grating antennas.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics arises as a viable solution to address the stringent resource demands of emergent technologies, such as neural networks. Within this framework, photonic memories are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits that have not yet found a standardized solution due to several trade-off among different metrics such as energy consumption, speed, footprint, or fabrication complexity, to name a few. In particular, a photonic memory exhibiting ultra-high endurance performance (&gt; 10^6 cycles) has been elusive to date. Here, we report an ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide (VO_2) exhibiting a record cyclability of up to 10^7 cycles without degradation. Moreover, our memory features an ultra-compact footprint below 5 {\mu}m with potential for nanosecond and picojoule programming performance. Our silicon photonic memory could find application in emerging photonic applications demanding high number of memory updates such as photonic neural networks with in-situ training.</description>

      <title>Thermal radiation forces on planar structures with asymmetric optical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light carries momentum and, upon interaction with material structures, can exert forces on them. Here, we show that a planar structure with asymmetric optical response is spontaneously accelerated when placed in an environment at a different temperature. This phenomenon originates from the imbalance in the exchange rates of photons between both sides of the structure and the environment. Using a simple theoretical model, we calculate the force acting on the planar structure and its terminal velocity in vacuum, and analyze their dependence on the initial temperature and the geometrical properties of the system for different realistic materials. Our results unravel an alternative approach to manipulating objects in the nano and microscale that does not require an external source of radiation.</description>

      <title>Chiral-stress-energy-momentum tensor for covariant description of spin and torque densities of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the spin angular momentum of circularly polarized light by Beth [Phys. Rev. 50, 115 (1936)] can be explained by using a microscopic torque density. However, the experiment does not resolve the space- and time-dependent evolution of the spin density of light and the wave plate and the covariant form of the microscopic torque density. Here we focus on the covariant description of the helicity, spin, and torque densities of light in materials using the chiral-stress-energy-momentum tensor. We also perform simulations of Gaussian light pulses in quarter-wave-plate geometries made of birefringent and dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>The Goldilocks Principle of Learning Unitaries by Interlacing Fixed Operators with Programmable Phase Shifters on a Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits represent an emerging technology that amalgamates photonics and electronics, paving the way for light-based information processing at high speeds and low power consumption. Programmable photonics provides a flexible platform that can be reconfigured to perform multiple tasks, thereby holding great promise for revolutionizing future optical networks and quantum computing systems. Over the past decade, there has been constant progress in developing several different architectures for realizing programmable photonic circuits that allow for realizing arbitrary discrete unitary operations with light. Here, we systematically investigate a general family of photonic circuits for realizing arbitrary unitaries based on a simple architecture that interlaces a fixed intervening layer with programmable phase shifter layers. We introduce a criterion for the intervening operator that guarantees the universality of this architecture for representing arbitrary $N \times N$ unitary operators with $N+1$ phase layers. We explore this criterion for different photonic components, including photonic waveguide lattices and meshes of directional couplers, which allows the identification of several families of photonic components that can serve as the intervening layers in the interlacing architecture. Our findings pave the way for efficiently designing and realizing novel families of programmable photonic integrated circuits for multipurpose analog information processing.</description>

      <title>Temporal Twistronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of twistronics and moir\'e physics, which is present in twisted two-dimensional bilayer materials, has recently attracted growing attention in various fields of science and engineering such as condensed matter physics, nanophotonics, polaritonics and excitonics. The twist angle between the two layers has offered an additional degree of control over electron and photon interaction with such structures. Inspired by the photonic version of twistronics, here we introduce and investigate theoretically the temporal analogue of twistronics in anisotropic optical media. We study how a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave propagating in a spatially unbounded, anisotropic medium undergoes major changes when the relative permittivity tensor of the medium is rapidly changed in time to create a new anisotropic medium that is the rotated version of the original medium. We consider both the elliptic and hyperbolic anisotropic scenarios. The propagation-angle-dependent forward (FW) and backward (BW) waves with their converted frequencies and relative amplitudes are obtained. To concentrate on the main features of this concept without getting into details of dispersion, in our work here we assume dispersionless and lossless material parameters. Our results reveal how frequency conversion is highly dependent on the direction of propagation of the original wave, rotation angle, and initial values of the material parameters, proposing another class of "magic angles" for such temporal twistronics.</description>

      <title>Unifying frequency metrology across microwave, optical, and free-electron domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency metrology lies at the heart of precision measurement. Optical frequency combs provide a coherent link uniting the microwave and optical domains in the electromagnetic spectrum, with profound implications in timekeeping, sensing and spectroscopy, fundamental physics tests, exoplanet search, and light detection and ranging. Here, we extend this frequency link to free electrons by coherent modulation of the electron phase by a continuous-wave laser locked to a fully stabilized optical frequency comb. Microwave frequency standards are transferred to the optical domain via the frequency comb, and are further imprinted in the electron spectrum by optically modulating the electron phase with a photonic chip-based microresonator. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we apply this frequency link in the calibration of an electron spectrometer, and use the electron spectrum to measure the optical frequency. Our work bridges frequency domains differed by a factor of $\sim10^{13}$ and carried by different physical objects, establishes a spectroscopic connection between electromagnetic waves and free-electron matter waves, and has direct ramifications in ultrahigh-precision electron spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Selective nonlinearities removal from digital signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many instruments performing optical and non-optical imaging and sensing, such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Fourier-transform spectrometry, produce digital signals containing modulations, sine-like components, which only after Fourier transformation give information about the structure or characteristics of the investigated object. Due to the fundamental physics-related limitations of such methods, the distribution of these signal components is often nonlinear and, when not properly compensated, leads to the resolution, precision or quality drop in the final image. Here, we propose an innovative approach that has the potential to allow cleaning of the signal from the nonlinearities but most of all, it now allows to switch the given order off, leaving all others intact. The latter provides a tool for more in-depth analysis of the nonlinearity-inducing properties of the investigated object, which can lead to applications in early disease detection or more sensitive sensing of chemical compounds. We consider OCT signals and nonlinearities up to the third order. In our approach, we propose two neural networks: one to remove solely the second-order nonlinearity and the other for removing solely the third-order nonlinearity. The input of the networks is a novel two-dimensional data structure with all the information needed for the network to infer a nonlinearity-free signal. We describe the developed networks and present the results for second-order and third-order nonlinearity removal in OCT data representing the images of various objects: a mirror, glass, and fruits.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free three-photon spectroscopy on narrow-line optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Gaussian-Schell Model: A Link Between Classical and Quantum Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum theory of the electromagnetic field uncovered that classical forms of light were indeed produced by distinct superpositions of nonclassical multiphoton wavepackets. Specifically, partially coherent light represents the most common kind of classical light. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the extraction of the constituent multiphoton quantum systems of a partially coherent light field. We shift from the realm of classical optics to the domain of quantum optics via a quantum representation of partially coherent light using its complex-Gaussian statistical properties. Our formulation of the quantum Gaussian-Schell model unveils the possibility of performing photon-number-resolving detection to isolate the constituent quantum multiphoton wavepackets of a classical light field. We experimentally verified the coherence properties of isolated vacuum systems and wavepackets with up to sixteen photons. Our findings not only demonstrate the possibility of observing quantum properties of classical macroscopic objects, but also establish a fundamental bridge between the classical and quantum worlds.</description>

      <title>Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target aberration domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quntized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) which characterizes the degradation-aware priors; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts. Codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Fast biological imaging with quantum-enhanced Raman microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging technique that probes the vibrational response of chemicals with high specificity and sensitivity. High-power, quantum-enhanced SRS microscopes have been recently demonstrated and applied to polymers and biological samples. Quantum correlations, in the form of squeezed light, enable the microscopes to operate below the shot noise limit, enhancing their performance without increasing the illumination intensity. This addresses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speed constraints introduced by photodamage in shot noise-limited microscopes. Previous microscopes have either used single-beam squeezing, but with insufficient brightness to reach the optimal ratio of pump-to-Stokes intensity for maximum SNR, or have used twin-beam squeezing and suffered a 3 dB noise penalty. Here we report a quantum-enhanced Raman microscope that uses a bright squeezed single-beam, enabling operation at the optimal efficiency of the SRS process. The increase in brightness leads to multimode effects that degrade the squeezing level, which we partially overcome using spatial filtering. We apply our quantum-enhanced SRS microscope to biological samples, and demonstrate quantum-enhanced multispectral imaging of living cells. The imaging speed of 100x100 pixels in 18 seconds allows the dynamics of cell organelles to be resolved. The SNR achieved is compatible with video rate imaging, with the quantum correlations yielding a 20% improvement in imaging speed compared to shot noise limited operation.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of blazed gratings under conical incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topology optimization method is presented and applied to a blazed diffraction grating in reflection under conical incidence. This type of gratings is meant to disperse the incident light on one particular diffraction order and this property is fundamental in spectroscopy. Conventionally, a blazed metallic grating is made of a sawtooth profile designed to work with the +/-1st diffraction order in reflection. In this paper, we question this intuitive triangular pattern and look for optimal opto-geometric characteristics using topology optimization based on Finite Element modelling of Maxwell's equations. In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic but it is enlightened by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence. A multi-wavelength objective is used in order to obtain a broadband blazed effect. Finally, several numerical experiments are detailed. The results show that it is possible to reach a 98% diffraction efficiency on the -1st diffraction order if the optimization is performed on a single wavelength, and that the reflection integrated over the [400,1500]nm wavelength range can be 29% higher in absolute, 56% in relative, than that of the sawtooth blazed grating when using a multi-wavelength optimization criterion (from 52% to 81%).</description>

      <title>Steering internal and outgoing electron dynamics in bilayer graphene cavities by cavity design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ballistic, gate-defined devices in two-dimensional materials offer a platform for electron optics phenomena influenced by the material's properties and gate control. We study the ray trajectory dynamics of all-electronic, gate-defined cavities in bilayer graphene to establish how distinct regimes of the internal and outgoing charge carrier dynamics can be tuned and optimized by the cavity shape, symmetry, and parameter choice, e.g., the band gap and the cavity orientation. In particular, we compare the dynamics of two cavity shapes, o'nigiri, and Lima\c{c}on cavities, which fall into different symmetry classes. We demonstrate that for stabilising regular, internal cavity modes, such as periodic and whispering gallery orbits, it is beneficial to match the cavity shape to the bilayer graphene Fermi line contour. Conversely, a cavity of a different symmetry than the material dispersion allows one to determine preferred emission directionalities in the emitted far-field.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Mitigating Dark Current Noise and Bad Pixels in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Cameras for Space-based Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the performance of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. These cameras have gained popularity as a viable alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras in a wide range of applications. One particular application is the CMOS camera installed in small space telescopes. However, the limited power and spatial resources available on satellites present challenges in maintaining ideal observation conditions, including temperature and radiation environment. Consequently, images captured by CMOS cameras are susceptible to issues such as dark current noise and defective pixels. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for mitigating dark current noise and bad pixels for CMOS cameras. Our approach involves two key steps: pixel clustering and function fitting. During pixel clustering step, we identify and group pixels exhibiting similar dark current noise properties. Subsequently, in the function fitting step, we formulate functions that capture the relationship between dark current and temperature, as dictated by the Arrhenius law. Our framework leverages ground-based test data to establish distinct temperature-dark current relations for pixels within different clusters. The cluster results could then be utilized to estimate the dark current noise level and detect bad pixels from real observational data. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted tests using real observation data obtained from the Yangwang-1 satellite, equipped with a near-ultraviolet telescope and an optical telescope. The results show a considerable improvement in the detection efficiency of space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Transport of non-classical light mediated by topological domain walls in a SSH photonic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in photonics technologies have significantly enhanced their capability to facilitate experiments involving quantum light, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge. Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls, facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity, topology-protected quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian systems with a real spectrum and selective skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we first show a simple approach to constructing non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with a real spectrum, which are \textit{not} obtained by a non-unitary transformation such as the imaginary gauge transformation. They are given, instead, by the product of a Hermitian Hamiltonian $H_0$ and a positive semi-definite matrix $A$. Depending on whether $A$ has zero eigenvalue(s), the resulting $H$ can possess an exceptional point at zero energy. When $A$ is only required to be Hermitian instead, the resulting $H$ is pseudo-Hermitian that can have real and complex conjugate energy levels. In the special case where $A$ is diagonal, we compare our approach to an imaginary gauge transformation, which reveals a selective non-Hermitian skin effect in our approach, i.e., only the zero mode is a skin mode and the non-zero modes reside in the bulk. We further show that this selective non-Hermitian skin mode has a much lower lasing threshold than its counterpart in the standard non-Hermitian skin effect with the same spatial profile, when we pump at the boundary where they are localized. The form of our construction can also be found, for example, in dynamical matrices describing coupled frictionless harmonic oscillators with different masses.</description>

      <title>Advancing large-scale thin-film PPLN nonlinear photonics with segmented tunable micro-heaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) devices have recently gained prominence for efficient wavelength conversion processes in both classical and quantum applications. However, the patterning and poling of TF-PPLN devices today are mostly performed at chip scales, presenting a significant bottleneck for future large-scale nonlinear photonic systems that require the integration of multiple nonlinear components with consistent performance and low cost. Here, we take a pivotal step towards this goal by developing a wafer-scale TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic platform, leveraging ultraviolet stepper lithography and an automated poling process. To address the inhomogeneous broadening of the quasi-phase matching (QPM) spectrum induced by film thickness variations across the wafer, we propose and demonstrate segmented thermal optic tuning modules that can precisely adjust and align the QPM peak wavelengths in each section. \hl{Using the segmented micro-heaters, we show the successful realignment of inhomogeneously broadened multi-peak QPM spectra with up to 57$\%$ enhancement of conversion efficiency. We achieve a high normalized conversion efficiency of 3802$\%$W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ in a 6 mm long PPLN waveguide, recovering 84$\%$ of the theoretically predicted efficiency in this device.} The advanced fabrication techniques and segmented tuning architectures presented herein pave the way for wafer-scale integration of complex functional nonlinear photonic circuits with applications in quantum information processing, precision sensing and metrology, and low-noise-figure optical signal amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the localization properties of optical waves in disordered systems with multifractal scattering potentials. In particular, we apply the localization landscape theory to the classical Helmholtz operator and, without solving the associated eigenproblem, show accurate predictions of localized eigenmodes for one- and two-dimensional multifractal structures. Finally, we design and fabricate nanoperforated photonic membranes in silicon nitride (SiN) and image directly their multifractal modes using leaky-mode spectroscopy in the visible spectral range. The measured data demonstrate optical resonances with multiscale intensity fluctuations in good qualitative agreement with numerical simulations. The proposed approach provides a convenient strategy to design multifractal photonic membranes, enabling rapid exploration of extended scattering structures with tailored disorder for enhanced light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning-enabled ultra-large field-of-view lens-free imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications necessitate real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging capabilities. Conventional lens-free imaging (LFI) systems, while addressing the limitations of physical lenses, have been constrained by dynamic, hard-to-model optical fields, resulting in a limited one-shot FOV of approximately 20 $mm^2$. This restriction has been a major bottleneck in applications like live-cell imaging and automation of microfluidic systems for biomedical research. Here, we present a deep-learning(DL)-based imaging framework - GenLFI - leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) for holographic image reconstruction. We demonstrate that GenLFI can achieve a real-time FOV over 550 $mm^2$, surpassing the current LFI system by more than 20-fold, and even larger than the world's largest confocal microscope by 1.76 times. The resolution is at the sub-pixel level of 5.52 $\mu m$, without the need for a shifting light source. The unsupervised learning-based reconstruction does not require optical field modeling, making imaging dynamic 3D samples (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models) in complex optical fields possible. This GenLFI framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, offering a robust tool to tackle new frontiers in high-throughput biomedical applications such as drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Polarization-based cyclic weak value metrology for angular velocity measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak measurement has been proven to amplify the detection of changes in meters while discarding most photons due to the low probability of post-selection. Previous power-recycling schemes enable the failed post-selection photons to be repeatedly selected, thus overcoming the inefficient post-selection and increasing the precision of detection. In this study, we focus on the polarization-based weak value angular-velocity measurement and introduce three cyclic methods to enhance the accuracy of detecting time shift in a Gaussian beam: power recycling, signal recycling, and dual recycling schemes. By incorporating one or two partially transmitting mirrors into the system, both the power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected light are substantially enhanced. Compared to non-polarization schemes, polarization-based approaches offer several advantages, including lower optical loss, unique cyclic directions, and a wider optimal region. These features effectively reduce crosstalk among different light paths and theoretically eliminate the walk-off effect, thus yielding improvements in both theoretical performance and application.</description>

Abstract: Correlated states of light, both classical and quantum, can find useful applications in the implementation of several imaging techniques. Among the employed sources, pseudo-thermal states, generated by the passage of a laser beam through a diffuser, represent the standard choice. To produce light with a higher level of correlation, in this work we consider and characterize the speckled-speckle field obtained with two diffusers using both a numerical simulation and an experimental implementation. In order to discuss the potential usefulness of super-thermal light in imaging protocols, we analyze the behavior of some figures of merit, namely the contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio and the image resolution. The obtained results clarify the possible advantages offered by this kind of light, and at the same time better emphasize the reasons why it does not outperform pseudo-thermal light.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to broaden the spectrum of possible applications of quantum computers and use their capabilities to investigate effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics ("cavity QED"). Interesting application examples are material properties, multiphoton effects such as superradiance, systems with strong field-matter coupling, and others. For QED applications, experimental studies are challenging, and classical simulations are often expensive. Therefore, exploring the capabilities of quantum computers is of interest. Below we present a methodology for simulating a phase transition in a pair of coupled cavities that permit photon hopping. We map the spin and boson systems to separate parts of the register and use first-order Trotterization to time-propagate the wavefunction. The order parameter, which is the observable for the phase transition, is calculated by measuring the number operator and its square. We introduce a boson-to-qubit mapping to facilitate a multi-photon, multi-atom case study. Our mapping scheme is based on the inverse Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the multi-photon regime, boson operators are expressed via higher-spin operators which are subsequently mapped on a circuit using Pauli operators. We use a Newton series expansion to enable rigorous treatment of the square root operator. We reproduce the results of classical simulations of a phase transition with a noiseless 6-qubit simulation. We find that the simulation can be performed with a modest amount of quantum resources. Finally, we perform simulations on noisy emulators and find that mitigation techniques are essential to distinguish signal from noise.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling, ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics. We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops. Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated structural dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology. In the finite-dimensional Fock space the NOON state ceases to be optimal when the particle number is fixed yet not equal to the space dimension minus one, and what is the true optimal state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present three theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal states reveal an important fact that the space dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

Abstract: Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection. Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181,000 counts/s. We observe and quantify the strain induced shift of the ground state spin states and demonstrate coherent control of the electron spin with a coherence time of T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: The critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and SUPER swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>

Abstract: Developing hybrid materials and structures for electromagnetic wave engineering has been a promising route towards novel functionalities and tunabilities in many modern applications and perspectives in new quantum technologies. Despite its established success in engineering optical light and terahertz waves, the implementation of meta-resonators operating at the microwave band is still emerging, especially those that allow for on-chip integration and size miniaturization, which has turned out crucial to developing hybrid quantum systems at the microwave band. In this work, we present a microwave meta-resonator consisting of split-ring and and spiral resonators, and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We observe broadened bandwidth to the split ring modes augmented by the additional spiral resonator, and, by coupling the modes to a magnetic sample, the resultant photon-magnon coupling can be significantly enhanced to more than ten-fold. Our work suggests that combinatorial, hybrid microwave resonators may be a promising approach towards future development and implementation of photon-magnon coupling in hybrid magnonic systems.</description>
