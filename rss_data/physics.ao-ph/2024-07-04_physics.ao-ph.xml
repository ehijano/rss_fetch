      <title>Regimes of Near-Inertial Wave Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When atmospheric storms pass over the ocean, they resonantly force near-inertial waves (NIWs); internal waves with a frequency close to the local Coriolis frequency $f$. It has long been recognised that the evolution of NIWs is modulated by the ocean's mesoscale eddy field. This can result in NIWs being concentrated into anticyclones and provide an efficient pathway for their propagation to depth. Whether mesoscale eddies are effective at modulating the behaviour of NIWs depends on the wave dispersiveness $\varepsilon^2 = f\lambda^2/\Psi$, where $\lambda$ is the deformation radius and $\Psi$ is a scaling for the eddy streamfunction. If $\varepsilon\gg1$, NIWs are strongly dispersive, and the waves are only weakly affected by the eddies. We calculate the perturbations away from a uniform wave field and the frequency shift away from $f$. If $\varepsilon\ll1$, NIWs are weakly dispersive, and the wave evolution is strongly modulated by the eddy field. In this weakly dispersive limit, ray-tracing emerges as a valid description of the NIW evolution even if the large-scale atmospheric forcing apparently violates the requisite assumption of a scale separation between the waves and the eddies. The large-scale forcing excites many wave modes, each of which varies on a short spatial scale and is amenable to asymptotic analysis analogous to the semi-classical analysis of quantum systems. The strong modulation of weakly dispersive NIWs by eddies has the potential to modulate the energy input into NIWs from the wind, but under oceanic conditions, this effect should be small.</description>

      <title>Validation of Theoretical Estimation Methods and Maximum Value Distribution Calculation for Parametric Roll Amplitude in Long-Crested Irregular Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric rolling is a parametric excitation phenomenon caused by GM variation in waves. There are a lot of studies of the estimation the conditions, the occurrence, and the amplitude of parametric rolling. On the other hand, there are relatively few cases in which theoretical methods for estimating parametric roll amplitudes in irregular waves have been validated in tank tests. The primary objective of this study is to validate theoretical estimation methods for the parametric roll amplitude in irregular waves and improve their accuracy. First, the probability density functions (PDF) of the parametric roll amplitude obtained from the model ship motion experiment in irregular waves are compared with that obtained from theoretical estimation methods. Second, the method to improve the accuracy of estimation of the roll restoring variation in irregular waves is suggested. Third, the method to estimate the distribution of the maximum amplitude of parametric rolling in irregular waves. As a result, the PDFs of the roll amplitude obtained from the experiments differ from the results of theoretical estimation. After that, by correcting GM variation, the results of theoretical estimation are closer to the experimental results. Moreover, by the theoretical estimation method using the moment equation, the qualitative estimation for the PDF of the maximum roll amplitude is succeeded.</description>

      <title>scores: A Python package for verifying and evaluating models and predictions with xarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: `scores` is a Python package containing mathematical functions for the verification, evaluation and optimisation of forecasts, predictions or models. It supports labelled n-dimensional (multidimensional) data, which is used in many scientific fields and in machine learning. At present, `scores` primarily supports the geoscience communities; in particular, the meteorological, climatological and oceanographic communities. `scores` not only includes common scores (e.g., Mean Absolute Error), it also includes novel scores not commonly found elsewhere (e.g., FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) score, Flip-Flop Index), complex scores (e.g., threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score), and statistical tests (such as the Diebold Mariano test). It also contains isotonic regression which is becoming an increasingly important tool in forecast verification and can be used to generate stable reliability diagrams. Additionally, it provides pre-processing tools for preparing data for scores in a variety of formats including cumulative distribution functions (CDF). At the time of writing, `scores` includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. All of the scores and statistical techniques in this package have undergone a thorough scientific and software review. Every score has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial that demonstrates its use in practice. `scores` supports `xarray` datatypes, allowing it to work with Earth system data in a range of formats including NetCDF4, HDF5, Zarr and GRIB among others. `scores` uses Dask for scaling and performance. Support for `pandas` is being introduced. The `scores` software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores/</description>
