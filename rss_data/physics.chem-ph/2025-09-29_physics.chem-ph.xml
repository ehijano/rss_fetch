      <title>Data-driven approach to the design of complexing agents for trivalent transuranium elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of complexes with transuranium elements have long been the object of research in various fields of chemistry. However, their experimental study is complicated by their rarity, high cost and special conditions necessary for working with such elements, and the complexity of quantum chemical calculations does not allow their use for large systems. To overcome these problems, we used modern machine learning methods to create a novel neural network architecture that allows to use available experimental data on a number of elements and thus significantly improve the quality of the resulting models. We also described the applicability domain of the presented model and identified the molecular fragments that most influence the stability of the complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a concise synthesis of unsymmetrical benzimidazole-fused naphthalene imide (BfNI) and anhydride (BfNA) derivatives featuring broad UV-Vis-NIR absorption, stable redox activity, and enhanced solubility. Incorporation of triarylamine donors induces strong intramolecular charge transfer and narrows the optical bandgap. This modular design bypasses multistep protection-deprotection and complex pi-assembly, offering a versatile platform for tunable optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>PhenoMoler: Phenotype-Guided Molecular Optimization via Chemistry Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current molecular generative models primarily focus on improving drug-target binding affinity and specificity, often neglecting the system-level phenotypic effects elicited by compounds. Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness (QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for phenotype-guided and structure-controllable molecular optimization.</description>

      <title>Multireference equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group for X-ray photoelectron spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and implement the core-valence separated multireference equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group method (CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG) for simulating X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of strongly correlated molecular systems. This method is numerically robust and computationally efficient, delivering accurate core-ionization energies with O(N^4) scaling relative to basis set size N in the EOM step. To ensure rigorous core intensivity, we propose a simple modification of the ground-state MR-DSRG formalism. We develop and compare three variants of the theory based on different approximations of the effective Hamiltonian: two derived from low-order perturbative methods (DSRG-MRPT2 and DSRG-MRPT3), and one from a non-perturbative scheme truncated to 1- and 2-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. We benchmark the CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG methods by computing vertical core-ionization energies for a representative molecular test set and comparing results against established single-reference and multireference methods. To demonstrate the applicability of CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG to strongly correlated systems, we compute the potential energy curves and vibrationally resolved XPS of N2 and CO and the XPS of ozone. Comparison with experimental data and other high-level theoretical results shows that all three CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG variants accurately predict vertical ionization energies, but only DSRG-MRPT3 and MR-LDSRG(2) levels of theory reliably capture the full dissociation behavior and reproduce the experimental vibrational structure.</description>

      <title>Automated Workflow for Absolute Binding Free Energy Calculations with Implicit Solvent and Double Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations can reduce the time and cost of identifying drug candidates from a diverse pool of molecules that may have been overlooked experimentally. These calculations typically employ explicit solvents; however these models can be computationally demanding and challenging to implement due to the difficulties in sampling waters and managing changes in net charge. To address these challenges, we introduce an automated parallel Python workflow that adopts the double decoupling method, incorporating conformational restraints and pairing it with the implicit generalized Born (GB) solvation model. This approach enhances convergence, reduces computational costs and avoids the technical issues associated with explicit solvents. We applied this workflow to a series of 93 host-guest complexes from the TapRoom database. When pooling all systems, the GB(OBC) model correlated well with experiment ($R^2 = 0.86$); however, this global metric obscured much weaker correlations observed within individual hosts ($R^2 = 0.3-0.8$). Systematic errors associated with charged functional groups (notably ammonium and carboxylates) were also evident, resulting in root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) greater than 6.12 kcal/mol across all models. Although the GB models did not achieve reliable accuracy across all systems, they may be practical when all ligands contain the same functional groups. Furthermore, a linear correction based on these functional groups reduced RMSE values to within 1 kcal/mol of experiment, and our error analysis suggests specific changes for future GB models to improve accuracy. Overall, the Python workflow demonstrates promise for fast, reliable absolute binding free energy calculations by leveraging the sampling efficiency of GB in a fully automated application.</description>

      <title>Noise-reduced stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large-scale calculations via tensor hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation significantly reduces the computational scaling of CC2 from O(N^5) to O(N^3), where N is a measure of system size. However, the inherent stochastic noise, while controllable, can introduce substantial errors in energy derivatives, limiting its reliability for molecular dynamics simulations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a noise-reduced approach, termed THC-sRI-CC2, which synergistically combines the sRI framework with tensor hypercontraction (THC). In this formulation, the expensive Coulomb term, which scales as O(N^4), is decoupled via THC, while the time-determining exchange term with an O(N^5) cost is addressed through the sRI scheme, collectively yielding an overall O(N^3) scaling. Benchmarks demonstrate that our THC-sRI-CC2 implementation achieves greater accuracy and markedly reduced stochastic noise compared to conventional sRI-CC2 with identical computational samplings. The resulting O(N^3) scaling substantially extends the applicability of CC2 for excited-state energy calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of large molecular systems. Furthermore, this work establishes a general THC-sRI hybrid strategy for the development of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular structures comprising four spins. In view of possible large spin quantum numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of merit.</description>

      <title>Development of an Optimized Parameter Set for Monovalent Ions in the Reference Interaction Site Model of Solvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of aqueous monovalent ions is essential for understanding the function of biomolecules, such as nucleic acid stability and binding of charged drugs to protein targets. The 1D and 3D reference interaction site models (1D- and 3D-RISM) of molecular solvation, as implemented in the AmberTools molecular modeling suite, are well suited for modeling mixtures of ionic species around biomolecules across a wide range of concentrations. However, the available ion model parameters were optimized for molecular dynamics simulations, not for the RISM framework, which includes a closure approximation. To address this, we optimized the Lennard-Jones 12-6 model for monovalent ions for 1D-RISM with the partial series expansion of order 3 closure by fitting to experimental values of ion-oxygen distance (IOD), hydration free energy (HFE), partial molar volume (PMV) and mean activity coefficient. The new parameter set demonstrated significant improvement in HFE, IOD, and mean activity coefficients, whereas no overall change was observed for the PMV. A second optimization step was necessary to account for the cation-anion interactions that affect the mean activity coefficients. The new parameters were validated at finite salt concentrations against experimental data for 16 ion pairs and showed improved accuracy for 14 of them, while the results for CsI and CsF were the second best. 1D-RISM results obtained with the new NaCl parameters were used to calculate the preferential interaction parameter of the ions around the 24L B-DNA using 3D-RISM. The new parameters demonstrated better agreement with experiment at physiological and higher concentrations. At lower concentrations, the results primarily depended on the closure with little effect from the ion parameters. Overall, the ion parameters specifically developed for RISM show improved accuracy at infinite dilution and finite concentrations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Molecular Dipole Moment Prediction with Multitask Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multitask machine learning strategy for improving the prediction of molecular dipole moments by simultaneously training on quantum dipole magnitudes and inexpensive Mulliken atomic charges. With dipole magnitudes as the primary target and assuming only scalar dipole values are available without vector components we examine whether incorporating lower quality labels that do not quantitatively reproduce the target property can still enhance model accuracy. Mulliken charges were chosen intentionally as an auxiliary task, since they lack quantitative accuracy yet encode qualitative physical information about charge distribution. Our results show that including Mulliken charges with a small weight in the loss function yields up to a 30% improvement in dipole prediction accuracy. This multitask approach enables the model to learn a more physically grounded representation of charge distributions, thereby improving both the accuracy and consistency of dipole magnitude predictions. These findings highlight that even auxiliary data of limited quantitative reliability can provide valuable qualitative physical insights, ultimately strengthening the predictive power of machine learning models for molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Polymer-based probabilistic bits for thermodynamic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that memory effects are necessary to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</description>

      <title>Shoot from the HIP: Hessian Interatomic Potentials without derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip</description>

      <title>Polarization-Sensitive Au-TiO2 Nanopillars for Tailored Photocatalytic Activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic metasurfaces play a crucial role in resonance-driven photocatalytic reactions by effectively enhancing reactivity via localized surface plasmon resonances. Catalytic activity can be selectively modulated by tuning the strength of plasmonic resonances through two primary non-thermal mechanisms: near-field enhancement and hot carrier injection, which govern the population of energetic carrier excited or injected into unoccupied molecular orbitals. We developed a set of polarization-sensitive metasurfaces consisting of elliptical Au-TiO2 nanopillars, specifically designed to plasmonically modulate the reactivity of a model reaction: the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals a polarization-dependent reaction yield in real-time, modulating from 4.7 (transverse electric polarization) to 9.98 (transverse magnetic polarization) in 10 s period, as quantified by the integrated area of the 480 cm-1 Raman peak and correlated with enhanced absorption at 633 nm. The single metasurface configuration enables continuous tuning of photocatalytic reactivity via active control of plasmonic resonance strength, as evidenced by the positive correlation between measured absorption and product yield. This dynamic approach provides a route to selectively enhance or suppress resonance-driven reactions, which can be further leveraged to achieve selectivity in multibranch reactions, guiding product yields toward desired outcomes.</description>

      <title>Introduction of modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Searching for Corannulene with ALMA: Observations of the Red Rectangle Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules responsible for the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), observed across a multitude of astrophysical environments. Despite their ubiquity, the precise formation mechanisms of PAHs remain unclear. One of the possible way for PAHs to form is in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red Rectangle nebula - a known emitter of AIBs. However, no specific PAH molecules have been detected in such environments, complicating the understanding of PAH formation and evolution. This study aimed to detect the PAH molecule corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large dipole moment of 2.07D. We analyzed high-resolution band 4 ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle nebula, collected over almost 9 hrs. Although corannulene emission was not detected, we estimated a firm upper limit on its abundance compared to hydrogen (5x10^-13) and we discuss the lack of detection in the context of our current understanding of PAH formation and destruction mechanisms. Additionally, we report tentative detection of signals at 139.612 GHz, 139.617 GHz, and 139.621 GHz, potentially originating from cyclopropenyledine c-C3H2 and the 140 GHz H2O maser.</description>

      <title>Fracture-Driven Single Bubble Grows and Migration Model in Aquatic Muds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methane (CH$_4$) is the most prevalent hydrocarbon and a significant greenhouse gas found in the atmosphere. Buoyancy-driven CH$_4$ bubble growth and migration within muddy aquatic sediments are closely associated with sediment fracturing. This paper presents a model of buoyancy-driven CH$_4$ single bubble growth in fine-grained cohesive (muddy) aquatic sediment. * Solid mechanics model component simulates bubble elastic expansion caused by solute supply from the surrounding mud, followed by differential fracturing of the mud by the evolving bubble front, a process governed by the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). This differential fracturing controls the evolving shape and size of the bubble. * The model integrates the LEFM with the dynamics of solute exchange between the bubble and the surrounding mud, alongside the conservation of CH$_4$ gas within the bubble. * An advanced meshing strategy allows balancing between the geometry resolution and the amount of mesh elements, thereby optimizing for both solution accuracy and computational efficiency. This model is intended to be a foundational tool for proper upscaling of single bubble characteristics to effective gassy medium theories. This will enhance the accuracy of the acoustic applications and could contribute to evaluation of overall CH$_4$ emission from the aquatic muds.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation--dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L032053 (2025)].Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Constrained Search in Imaginary Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an imaginary-time evolution method to evaluate the pure-state constrained-search functional from density-functional theory formulated on finite lattices. Simultaneously, it yields a potential that produces a prescribed density of an eigenstate. Besides being a computational scheme, this allows one to gain theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping. The method can be generalized to the optimization of the expectation value of a general self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a finite number of expectation-value constraints for commuting self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>
