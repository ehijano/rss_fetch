      <title>Moving skyrmions in Antiferromagnets by Sublattice Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The texture in antiferromagnets hosting a topologically protected skyrmion can be viewed as two effectively coupled ferromagnetic skyrmions. Assuming rigid magnetic configurations, we show that this coupling results in an effective mass of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion and that its dynamics can be viewed as due to a relative displacement of the two sublattice ferromagnetic skyrmions. The theory holds for different antiferromagnetic systems and includes effects from dissipation and external forces caused by electric currents. We verify our analytical results by micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for dispersion relations of spacetime-periodic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as a consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Electron Trapping by Defect Midgap State and Quantum Confinement to Optimize Hot Carrier Effect in a Nanowire Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot carrier effect, a phenomenon where charge carriers generated by photon absorption remain energetic by not losing much energy, has been one of the leading strategies in increasing solar cell efficiency. Nanostructuring offers an effective approach to enhance hot carrier effect via the spatial confinement, as occurring in a nanowire structure. The recent experimental study by Esmaielpour et al. [ACS Applied Nano Materials 7, 2817 (2024)] reveals a fascinating non-monotonic dependence of the hot carrier effect in nanowire array on the diameter of the nanowire, contrary to what might be expected from quantum confinement alone. We show that this non-monotonic behavior can be explained by a simple model for electron energy loss that involves two principal mechanisms. First, electron-phonon scattering, that increases with nanowire diameter, leading to hot carrier effect that decreases with increasing diameter. Second, electron capture by a defect level within band gap, that is, a midgap state, that decreases with nanowire diameter, leading to hot carrier effect that increases with increasing diameter. The two mechanisms balance at a certain diameter corresponding to optimal hot carrier effect. Our result offers a guideline to optimize hot carrier effect in nanowire solar cells and ultimately their efficiency by adjusting the dimensions and micro-structural properties of nanowires.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional valley-contrasting sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin and valley are two fundamental properties of electrons in crystals. The similarity between them is well understood in valley-contrasting physics established decades ago in two-dimensional (2D) materials like graphene--with broken inversion symmetry, the two valleys in graphene exhibit opposite orbital magnetic moments, similar to the spin-1/2 behaviors of electrons, and opposite Berry curvature that leads to a half topological charge. However, valley-contrasting physics has never been explored in 3D crystals. Here, we develop a 3D acoustic crystal exhibiting 3D valley-contrasting physics. Unlike spin that is fundamentally binary, valley in 3D can take six different values, each carrying a vortex in a distinct direction. The topological valley transport is generalized from the edge states of 2D materials to the surface states of 3D materials, with interesting features including robust propagation, topological refraction, and valley-cavity localization. Our results open a new route for wave manipulation in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>

      <title>Memory resistor based in GaAs 2D-bilayers: In and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant tunneling between closely spaced two dimensional electron gases is a single particle phenomenon that has sparked interest for decades. High tunneling conductances at equal electron densities are observed whenever the Fermi levels of the two quantum wells align. Detuning the Fermi levels out of the resonant 2D-2D tunneling regime causes a negative differential resistance. The negative differential resistance leads to a hysteresis when operating the device in a current driven mode, allowing a bilayer system to function as a volatile memory resistor.</description>

      <title>Borophane as substrate for adsorption of He-4: A journey across dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In search of substrates for adsorption of He atoms allowing for novel quantum phases in restricted geometry we study the case of borophane. We focus on two allotropes of borophane, alpha-4H and Rect-2H. With a suitable Density Functional Theory we characterize the adsorption potential of a He atom on such crystalline substrates finding its corrugation, the preferential adsorption sites and the energy barrier between sites. Rect-2H borophane is particularly interesting due to thepresence of ridges in the adsorption potential with modest energy barriers in one direction of the basal plane and much higher barrier in the orthogonal direction, thus forming channels for motion of the adsorbed atoms. We study the adsorption of He-4 on Rect-2H borophane using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations. In the first adsorbed layer the He-4 atoms are rather delocalized along a channel with no exchanges between channels. This strong anisotropy is present also in the first few additional adsorption layers of He-4 with presence of ordered and of disordered regions. In the second and the fifth layers at low temperature we find superfluidity on the length scale of the simulated systems. In the second layer the superfluidity is one-dimensional along the grooves. In the fifth layer the state is a strongly anisotropic two-dimensional superfluid at low coverage, with a crossover to an isotropic one at layer completion. Starting from the sixth layer the adsorbed He-4 film evolves toward a three-dimensional superfluid. Our main prediction is that Rect-2H borophane as a substrate will allow to probe 1D superfluidity in the second absorption layer, as well as the evolution from a 2D anisotropic superfluid to an isotropic one in the fifth layer, and eventually the onset of 3D superfluidity for higher coverages.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to fermionic lead, we show by characterizing its spectral form factor and level spacing distribution, that the system falls in the twilight zone between integrable and non-integrable regimes, which we call partially non-integrable. We further evidence that, despite being only partially non-integrable and thereby falling outside the remit of the standard eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, it nevertheless experiences IQS as well as OQS thermalization.</description>

      <title>Interlayer dislocations in multilayer and bulk MoS${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in van der Waals materials are linear defects confined to the interfaces between consecutive stoichiometric monolayers of a bulk layered crystal. Here, we present a mesoscale model for the description of interlayer dislocations in thin films of transition metal dichalcogenides. Taking 2H-MoS${}_2$ as a representative material, we compute the dependence of the dislocation energy on the film thickness, from few-layer MoS$_2$ to the bulk crystal, and analyse the strain field in the layers surrounding a dislocation. We also analyse the influence of strain field on the band edge profiles for electrons and holes, and conclude that the resulting energy profiles are incapable of localising charge carriers, in particular at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Nonlinear Resonant Spin Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical generation of nonequilibrium spin magnetization plays a crucial role in advancing spintronics, providing ultrafast control of magnetization dynamics without the need for magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of light-induced nonlinear spin magnetization (LNSM), which becomes a dominant effect in centrosymmetric materials. We reveal the quantum geometric origins of various LNSM contributions in both metallic and insulating systems. Through detailed symmetry analysis, we predict significant LNSM in the antiferromagnetic material CuMnAs. Notably, under circularly polarized light, the spin magnetization exhibits helicity-dependent behavior, reversing with opposite light helicity. These findings open up new possibilities for generating LNSM-driven nonlinear spin-orbit torques and developing innovative opto-spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors and fermionic superfluids. We identify cases where the long-time SH response is determined by a pole in the averaged SH susceptibility, located on the unphysical sheet of its Riemann surface. Using analytic continuation across the two-particle branch cut, we obtain the zero-temperature dispersion relation and damping rate of the SH mode linked to this pole. When the coherence length significantly exceeds the mean free path, the pole is ``hidden'' behind the two-particle continuum edge at $2\Delta$, leading to SH oscillations at late times decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$. Nevertheless, the pole induces a peak in the retarded SH susceptibility at a frequency above $2\Delta$ and causes sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z=4$ at both late times and long distances. Conversely, long-distance oscillations at a fixed frequency $\omega$ occur only for $\omega$ exceeding $2\Delta$, with a spatial period diverging at the threshold as $1/(\omega - 2\Delta)^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, the pole can reemerge into the continuum, resulting in additional late-time oscillations at fixed wave vectors with frequencies above $2\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr2O3 and CoF2 as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>How does Goldene Stack?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D atomic monolayer of gold, has opened new avenues in exploring novel materials. However, the question of when multilayer Goldene transitions into bulk gold remains unresolved. This study used density functional theory calculations to address this fundamental question. Our findings reveal that multilayer Goldene retains an AA-like stacking configuration of up to six layers, with no observation of Bernal-like stacking as seen in graphene. Goldene spontaneously transitions to a bulk-like gold structure at seven layers, adopting a rhombohedral (ABC-like) stacking characteristic of bulk face-centered cubic (FCC) gold. The atomic arrangement converges entirely to the bulk gold lattice for more than ten layers. Quantum confinement significantly impacts the electronic properties, with monolayer and bulk Goldene exhibiting a single Dirac cone at the X-point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast, multilayer Goldene shows two Dirac cones at the X- and Y-points. Additionally, monolayer Goldene exhibits anisotropic optical absorption, which is absent in bulk gold. This study provides a deeper understanding of multilayer Goldene's structural and electronic properties and stacked 2D materials in general.</description>

      <title>Phase-cycling and double-quantum two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy using a common-path birefringent interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting distinct quantum pathways in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) can give particularly deep insights into coherent and incoherent interactions and quantum dynamics in various materials. This includes isolating rephasing and non-rephasing pathways for conventional single-quantum 2DES, but also the ability to record double- and zero-quantum spectra. Such advanced 2DES schemes usually require phase-cycling when performed in a partially or fully collinear geometry. A particularly simple and effective implementation of 2DES utilizes an in-line birefringent interferometer, the Translating-Wedge-based Identical pulses eNcoding System (TWINS), for the generation of an inherently phase-stable collinear excitation pulse pair. Here, we demonstrate how the TWINS can be adapted to allow for phase-cycling and experimental access to isolated quantum pathways. These new capabilities are demonstrated by recording rephasing, non-rephasing, zero-quantum and double-quantum 2DES on a molecular J-aggregate. This easy-to-implement extension opens up new experimental possibilities for TWINS-based 2DES in multidimensional all-optical and photoemission spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ from $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 11.23 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field crystal study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four $5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.</description>

      <title>Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing and Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures, however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions. Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature. Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.</description>

      <title>Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</description>

Abstract: Dark field X-ray microscopy (DXFM) can visualize microstructural distortions in bulk crystals. Using the femtosecond X-ray pulses generated by X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL), DFXM can achieve sub-{\mu}m spatial resolution and &lt;100 fs time resolution simultaneously. In this paper, we demonstrate ultrafast DFXM measurements at the European XFEL to visualize an optically-driven longitudinal strain wave propagating through a diamond single crystal. We also present two DFXM scanning modalities that are new to the XFEL sources: spatially 3D and 2D axial-strain scans with sub-{\mu}m spatial resolution. With this progress in XFEL-based DFXM, we discuss new opportunities to study multi-timescale spatio-temporal dynamics of microstructures.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Simulation of Diffusive Charge Transport in Disordered Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge transport in disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems showcases a myriad of unique phenomenologies that highlight different aspects of the underlying quantum dynamics. Electrons in such systems undergo a crossover from ballistic propagation to Anderson localization, contingent on the system's effective coherence length. Between the extended and localized phases lies a diffusive crossover in which the charge conductivity is properly defined. The numerical observation of this regime has remained elusive because it requires fully coherent transport to be simulated in systems whose dimensions are sufficiently large to meaningfully split the mean-free path and localization length scales. To address this challenge, we employed a novel linear scaling time-resolved approach that enabled us to derive the dc-transport characteristics and observe the three expected 2D transport regimes - ballistic, diffusive, and localized.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dictated topology in periodic gauge fields and realization in strained and twisted 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) of Hamiltonian dictates double degeneracy between a pair of superpartners (SPs) transformed by supercharge, except at zero energy where modes remain unpaired in many cases. Here we explore a SUSY of complete isospectrum between SPs -- with paired zero modes -- realized by 2D electrons in zero-flux periodic gauge fields, which can describe twisted or periodically strained 2D materials. We find their low-energy sector containing zero (or threshold) modes must be topologically non-trivial, by proving that Chern numbers of the two SPs have a finite difference dictated by the number of zero modes and energy dispersion in their vicinity. In $30^\circ$ twisted bilayer (double bilayer) transition metal dichalcogenides subject to periodic strain, we find one SP is topologically trivial in its lowest miniband, while the twin SP of identical dispersion has a Chern number of $1$ ($2$), in stark contrast to time-reversal partners that have to be simultaneously trivial or nontrivial. For systems whose physical Hamiltonian corresponds to the square root of a SUSY Hamiltonian, such as twisted or strained bilayer graphene, we reveal that topological properties of the two SUSY SPs are transferred respectively to the conduction and valence bands, including the contrasted topology in the low-energy sector and identical topology in the high-energy sector. This offers a unified perspective for understanding topological properties in many flat-band systems described by such square-root models. Both types of SUSY systems provide unique opportunities for exploring correlated and topological phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: Large scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes containing more than one hundred thousands chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Photosynthetic antenna complexes present in Green sulfur bacteria and Purple bacteria have been analyzed using a radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, well known in the field of quantum optics, instead of the widely used dipole-dipole Frenkel Hamiltonian. This approach allows to study ensembles of emitters beyond the small volume limit (system size much smaller than the absorbed wavelength), where the Frenkel Hamiltonian fails. When analyzed on a large scale, such structures display superradiant states much brighter then their single components. An analysis of the robustness to static disorder and dynamical (thermal) noise, shows that exciton coherence in the whole photosynthetic complex is larger than the coherence found in its parts. This provides evidence that the photosynthetic complex as a whole has a predominant role in sustaining coherences in the system even at room temperature. Our results allow a better understanding of natural photosynthetic antennae and could drive experiments to verify how the response to the electromagnetic radiation depends on the size of the photosynthetic antenna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate coherent Rabi oscillations of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers by magnetoelastic waves. The coupling is consistent with dipolar stray field drive from spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic film, and displays a significant improvement in Radio Frequency power efficiency relative to other methods of microwave excitation. Further, it demonstrates coherent coupling with NV centers over mm-scale distances from the microwave excitation source. By utilizing a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive heterostucture, where magnetoelastic waves can be launched by an applied voltage, a pure voltage driven coherent drive of the NV centers is achieved. This voltage driven, magnetoelastic excitation enables a new approach to couple with two level quantum states that is not reliant on long spin-wave coherence lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the dynamics of quantum coherence serves as an effective probe for identifying dephasing, which is a distinctive signature of many-body localization (MBL). Quantum coherence can be utilized to measure both the local coherence of specific subsystems and the total coherence of the whole system in a consistent manner. Our results reveal that the local coherence of small subsystems decays over time following a power law in the MBL phase, while it reaches a stable value within the same time window in the Anderson localized (AL) phase. In contrast, the total coherence of the whole system exhibits logarithmic growth during the MBL phase and reaches a stable value in the AL phase. Notably, this dynamic characteristic of quantum coherence remains robust even with weak interactions and displays unbounded behavior in infinite systems. Our results provide insights into understanding many-body dephasing phenomena in MBL systems and propose a novel feasible method for identifying and characterizing MBL phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>SUPER excitation of quantum emitters is a multi-photon process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The swing-up of quantum emitter population (SUPER) scheme allows to populate the excited state of a quantum emitter with near-unity fidelity using two red-detuned laser pulses. Its off-resonant, yet fully coherent nature has attracted significant interest in quantum photonics as a valuable tool for preparing single-photon sources in their excited state on demand, while simultaneously ensuring straightforward spectral filtering of the laser. However, the physical understanding of this mechanism in terms of energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the emitter is still lacking. Here, we present a fully quantized model of the swing-up excitation and demonstrate that it is in fact a multi-photon process, where one of the modes loses two or more photons while the other gains at least one. Our findings provide an unexpected physical interpretation of the SUPER scheme and unveil a new non-linear interaction between single emitters and multiple field modes.</description>

Abstract: The recently observed temperature-dependent quasiphase transition of the single-file water chain confined within a carbon nanotube in experiments has been validated by the simple lattice theory and molecular dynamics simulations. It has been pointed out that the atomic charges in water models are important, yet how the values will affect the structural details and thermodynamic properties of the quasiphase transition has not been fully revealed. In this work, we perform orientational-biased replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to explore the effect of atomic charges in the SPC/E water model on the quasiphase transition of a single-file water chain. Based on the atomic charge values reported in literature, three distinct quasiphases are reproduced, comprising a fully hydrogen-bonded water chain at lower temperatures, a more ordered dipolar orientation along the tube axis at intermediate temperatures, and a completely disordered structure at higher temperatures. Then by increasing the atomic charge values, we find that the fragmentation of the entire water chain into shorter water segments, the orientational ordering of water dipoles along the tube axis, and the transition towards complete disorder are all inhibited. Consequently, the transition temperatures between three quasiphases have been shifted to higher temperatures. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the increased atomic charge values enhance the hydrogen bonding between neighbouring water molecules also the electrostatic attraction within the water chain, leading to a longer water dipole correlation length even at higher temperatures. These findings highlight the vital role of atomic charges in water models also the electrostatic interaction in regulating the orientational ordering of water molecules under nanoconfinement.</description>
