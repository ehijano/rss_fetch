      <title>Acoustic angular sorting of resonant subwavelength particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism for angular sorting of subwavelength particles in accord with their resonances and sizes, realised with the forces imposed by acoustic (ultrasound) waves with different wavelengths. We analyse how the acoustic force acting on a small particle depends on its size relative to the ultrasound wavelength, and how the detuning between the two different beams influences the size range and angular distribution for unambiguous sorting outcomes for a given size range. We predict a range of scenarios depending on the particular materials and provide several feasible examples and discuss their practical realisation.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds on the entropy flow rate and Lyapunov exponents in differentiable dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some microscopic dynamics are also macroscopically irreversible, dissipating energy and producing entropy. For many-particle systems interacting with deterministic thermostats, the rate of thermodynamic entropy dissipated to the environment is the average rate at which phase space contracts. Here, we use this identity and the properties of a classical density matrix to derive upper and lower bounds on the entropy flow rate with the spectral properties of the local stability matrix. These bounds are an extension of more fundamental bounds on the Lyapunov exponents and phase space contraction rate of continuous-time dynamical systems.They are maximal and minimal rates of entropy production, heat transfer, and transport coefficients set by the underlying dynamics of the system and deterministic thermostat. Because these limits on the macroscopic dissipation derive from the density matrix and the local stability matrix, they are numerically computable from the molecular dynamics. As an illustration, we show that these bounds are on the electrical conductivity for a system of charged particles subject to an electric field.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient: New Approach to Study Auxetic Piezoelectric Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology to assess the performance of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) in order to study auxetic enhancement possibilities. For this purpose, a new approach for evaluating the intrinsic effective Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient (EMCC) of piezoelectric layers is presented. As the current assessment methods are questioned under resonance exposures, theoretical models are presented to suggest what characteristics the harvested power will depend on. A two axis graph is introduced to enable the comparison of different PEHs. The method is finally applied to PEHs with different types of substrates: filled, hollow and auxetic. First results show that, generally, auxetic structures might not increase the intrinsic EMCC but only improve the elastic energy ratio in the piezoelectric layers.</description>
