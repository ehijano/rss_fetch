      <title>The Role of Connection Density in an Adaptive Network with Chaotic Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of connection density in an adaptive network model of chaotic units that dynamically rewire based on their internal states and local coherence. By systematically varying the network's connectivity density, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes and structural transitions, revealing mechanisms of spontaneous modularity, dynamical segregation, and integration. We find that at higher densities, the network exhibits both local clustering and global synchrony. Additionally, we observe that low-density networks tend to fragment into desynchronized clusters, while high-density networks converge to synchronized states combining strong global integration with persistent modular segregation. Inspired by neural architectures, our model provides a general framework for understanding how simple microscopic rules can give rise to complex emergent behaviors in dynamical networks.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Administrative burden has been growing in organizations despite many counterproductive effects. We develop a system dynamics model to explain why this phenomenon occurs and to explore potential remedies. Prior literature has identified behavioral mechanisms leading to process creation, obsolescence, and removal, but typically examines them individually. Here, we integrate these mechanisms in the context of an organization allocating limited resources to competing priorities. We show that their interaction -- via accumulation and feedback loops -- leads to two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilizes, and runaway administrative bloat, where administrative costs and waste accumulate in a self-reinforcing cycle. The two outcomes are separated by a critical threshold in management behavioral parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. Rapid environmental change worsens the threshold, making bloat more likely. We evaluate several intervention strategies using simulation and find that lasting reductions in administrative costs and waste require two key commitments: a permanent shift in organizational priorities, and investment in discerning obsolete processes from useful ones. In contrast, temporary shifts and indiscriminate process cuts offer only short-lived relief. Counterintuitively, we find that prioritizing direct production can increase administrative waste. Our findings suggest that while dynamic environments make administrative bloat more likely, administrative bloat is not inevitable -- managers play a critical role in preventing or reversing it.</description>
