      <title>Acceleration from a clustering environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of correlations in a random environment on a random walker. The dependence of its asymptotic speed on the correlations is a nonperturbative effect as it is not captured by a homogeneous version of the same environment. For a slowly cooling environment, the buildup of correlations modifies the walker's speed and, by so, realizes acceleration. We remark on the possible relevance in the discussion of cosmic acceleration as traditionally started from the Friedmann equations, which, from a statistical mechanical point of view, would amount to a mean-field approximation. Our environment is much simpler though, with transition rates sampled from the one-dimensional Ising model and allowing exact results and detailed velocity characteristics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics of ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics as well as the population dynamics of ecosystems based on a stochastic approach in which the number of individuals of the several species of the ecosystem are treated as stochastic variables. The several species are connected by feeding relationships that are understood as unidirectional processes in which a certain amount of biomass is exchanged between species. We show that the equations for the averages in the numbers of individuals are that given by the deterministic approach. We determine the fluxes of mass, energy, and entropy as well as the rate of the entropy production. This last quantity, which has a central role in the present stochastic approach, is obtained by a formula appropriate for unidirectional transitions. The flux of energy across the ecosystem is shown to be proportional to the flux of entropy to the environment.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of principal minors: Cavity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinants are useful to represent the state of an interacting system of (effectively) repulsive and independent elements, like fermions in a quantum system and training samples in a learning problem. A computationally challenging problem is to compute the sum of powers of principal minors of a matrix which is relevant to the study of critical behaviors in quantum fermionic systems and finding a subset of maximally informative training data for a learning algorithm. Specifically, principal minors of positive square matrices can be considered as statistical weights of a random point process on the set of the matrix indices. The probability of each subset of the indices is in general proportional to a positive power of the determinant of the associated sub-matrix. We use Gaussian representation of the determinants for symmetric and positive matrices to estimate the partition function (or free energy) and the entropy of principal minors within the Bethe approximation. The results are expected to be asymptotically exact for diagonally dominant matrices with locally tree-like structures. We consider the Laplacian matrix of random regular graphs of degree $K=2,3,4$ and exactly characterize the structure of the relevant minors in a mean-field model of such matrices. No (finite-temperature) phase transition is observed in this class of diagonally dominant matrices by increasing the positive power of the principal minors, which here plays the role of an inverse temperature.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-time scaling in the transcritical, saddle-node, and pitchfork discrete and continuous bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifurcations are one of the most remarkable features of dynamical systems. Corral et al. [Sci. Rep. 8(11783), 2018] showed the existence of scaling laws describing the transient (finite-time) dynamics in discrete dynamical systems close to a bifurcation point, following an approach that was valid for the transcritical as well as for the saddle-node bifurcations. We reformulate those previous results and extend them to other discrete and continuous bifurcations, remarkably the pitchfork bifurcation. In contrast to the previous work, we obtain a finite-time bifurcation diagram directly from the scaling law, without a necessary knowledge of the stable fixed point. The derived scaling laws provide a very good and universal description of the transient behavior of the systems for long times and close to the bifurcation points.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a hard-core non-polar active lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of a non-polar active lattice gas model with excluded volume interactions that exhibits motility-induced phase separation under appropriate conditions. For quasi-one dimension and higher, stability analysis of the noiseless hydrodynamics gives quantitative bounds on the phase boundary of the motility-induced phase separation in terms of spinodal and binodal. Inclusion of the multiplicative noise in the fluctuating hydrodynamics describes the exponentially decaying two-point correlations in the stationary-state homogeneous phase. Our hydrodynamic description and theoretical predictions based on it are in excellent agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations and pseudo-spectral iteration of the hydrodynamics equations. Our construction of hydrodynamics for this model is not suitable in strictly one-dimension with single-file constraints, and we argue that this breakdown is associated with micro-phase separation.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that equilibrium systems in $d$ dimension that obey the inequality $d\nu&gt; 2,$ known as Harris criterion, exhibit suppressed energy fluctuation in their critical state. Ashkin-Teller model is an example in $d=2$ where the correlation length exponent $\nu$ varies continuously with the inter-spin interaction strength $\lambda$ and exceeds the value $d/2$ set by Harris criterion when $\lambda$ is negative; there, the variance of the subsystem energy across a length scale $l$ varies as $l^{d-\alpha}$ with hyperuniformity exponent $\alpha = 2(1-\nu^{-1}).$ Point configurations constructed by assigning unity to the sites which has coarse-grained energy beyond a threshold value also exhibit suppressed number fluctuation and hyperuniformiyty with same exponent $\alpha.$</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica-Potts CFTs in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a numerical conformal bootstrap study of CFTs with $S_n \ltimes (S_Q)^n$ global symmetry. These include CFTs that can be obtained as coupled replicas of two-dimensional critical Potts models. Particular attention is paid to the special case $S_3 \ltimes (S_3)^3$, which governs the critical behaviour of three coupled critical 3-state Potts models, a multi-scalar realisation of a (potentially) non-integrable CFT in two dimensions. The model has been studied in earlier works using perturbation theory, transfer matrices, and Monte Carlo simulations. This work represents an independent non-perturbative analysis. Our results are in agreement with previous determinations: we obtain an allowed peninsula within parameter space for the scaling dimensions of the three lowest-lying operators in the theory, which contains the earlier predictions for these scaling dimensions. Additionally, we derive numerous bounds on admissible scaling dimensions in the theory, which are compatible with earlier results. Our work sets the necessary groundwork for a future precision study of these theories in the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Traffic Modeling and Forecast based on Stochastic Cell-Automata and Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing -- A Numerical Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates accurate traffic modeling and forecast using stochastic cell-automata (CA) and distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). Traffic congestion is a dominant issue in highways. To reduce congestion, real-time traffic control by short-term forecast is necessary. For achieving this, data assimilation using a stochastic CA model and DFOS is promising. Data assimilation with a CA enables us to model real-time traffic flow with simple processes even when rare or sudden events occur, which is challenging for usual machine learning-based methods. DFOS overcomes issues of conventional point sensors that have dead zones of observation. By estimating optimal model parameters that reproduce observed traffic flow in the simulation, future traffic flow is forecasted from the simulation. We propose an optimal model parameter estimation method using mean velocity as an extracted feature and the particle filter. In addition, an estimation methodology for the microscopic traffic situation is developed to set the initial condition of simulation for forecast in accordance with observation. The proposed methods are verified by simulation-based traffic flow. The simulation adopts the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model. The optimal model parameters are successfully derived from posterior probability distributions (PPDs) estimated from DFOS data. In contrast, those estimated from point sensors fail. The PPDs of model parameters also indicate that each parameter has different sensitivities to traffic flow. A traffic forecast up to 60 minutes later is carried out. Using optimal model parameters estimated from DFOS, the forecast error of mean velocity is approximately $\pm$10 km/h (percentage error is 18%). The error attains half of it when conventional point sensors are used. We conclude that DFOS is a powerful technique for traffic modeling and short-term forecast.</description>

      <title>Math behind everyday life: on distribution of "black days" and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as ``black days'', where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we have performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Employing the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of sequences of events on a 2D manifold ${\cal M}$ at some large $D_{cr}$, which we interpret as the manifestation of ``black days'' and which occurs in a narrow interval around $D_{cr}$. We found that increasing the number of sequences within rather wide interval below $D_{cr}$ leads to a plateau in the clustering on ${\cal M}$. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Finally, we have addressed the question ``How the infinite-dimensional space could look like?'' Considering the eigenvalue problem for the hyperspherical Laplacian $\nabla^2_D$ in the limit $D\to\infty$, we conjectured about the topology of a target space representing the hyperspherical layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been much explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of a MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcome the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to a MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law transition as the measurement strength is increased. Possible experimental relevance to levitated nanoparticle arrays is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: H\"orner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known H\"orner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>A frustrated antipolar phase analogous to classical spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Measurements conspire nonlocally to restructure critical quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically how local measurements perfomed on critical quantum ground states affect long-distance correlations. These states are highly entangled and feature algebraic correlations between local observables. As a consequence, local measurements can have highly nonlocal effects. Our focus is on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) ground states, a continuous family of critical states in one dimension whose structure is parameterized by a Luttinger parameter $K$. We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements, performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a particular measurement outcome we show that there is a transition in the character of the post-measurement quantum state for $K&lt;1$, and highlight a formal analogy with the effect of a static impurity on transport through a TLL. To investigate the full ensemble of measurement outcomes we consider averages of physical quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory under exchange of replicas is broken for $K&lt;1/2$. A well-known barrier to experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has been the need to post-select on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the transition. The phenomena we discuss are, moreover, robust to local decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for engineering chiral interactions in Rydberg atoms via a directional antiblockade condition, where an atom can change its state only if an atom to its right (or left) is excited. The scalability of our scheme enables us to explore the many-body dynamics of kinetically constrained models with unidirectional character. We observe non-ergodic behavior via either scars, confinement, or localization, upon simply tuning the strength of two driving fields acting on the atoms. We discuss how our mechanism persists in the presence of classical noise and how the degree of chirality in the interactions can be tuned, opening towards the frontier of directional, strongly correlated, quantum mechanics using neutral atoms arrays.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a large-sized compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may spontaneously take place, either cyclically (with entropy barriers) or continuously (with an energy barrier). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, the refrigeration statement and the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics cannot be applied. The basic principle of maximum entropy is always adhered to.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: exact analysis through theory of block Toeplitz determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are usually significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics still allow explicit representations that generalize the strong Szeg\"o's theorem for scalar symbols. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate certain ``anomalous terms'' in the exponential form factor expansions of the re-scaled correlators. Since our boundaries in the naive scaling limits can be formulated as certain integrable boundaries/defects in 2D massive QFTs, the results of this work facilitate detailed comparisons with bootstrap approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-compact quantum spin chains as integrable stochastic particle processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13028v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify emergent hydrodynamics governing charge transport in Brownian random circuits with various symmetries, constraints, and ranges of interactions. This is accomplished via a mapping between the averaged dynamics and the low energy spectrum of a Lindblad operator, which acts as an effective Hamiltonian in a doubled Hilbert space. By explicitly constructing dispersive excited states of this effective Hamiltonian using a single mode approximation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of diffusive, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive relaxation in many-body systems with conserved multipole moments and variable interaction ranges. Our approach further allows us to identify exotic Krylov-space-resolved hydrodynamics exhibiting diffusive relaxation despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically. Our approach provides a general and versatile framework to qualitatively understand the dynamics of conserved operators under random unitary time evolution.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) substantially different from Metropolis Monte Carlo dynamics? This is a fundamental question at the time of understanding the most used training algorithm in the field of Machine Learning, but it received no answer until now. Here we show that in discrete optimization and inference problems, the dynamics of an SGD-like algorithm resemble very closely that of Metropolis Monte Carlo with a properly chosen temperature, which depends on the mini-batch size. This quantitative matching holds both at equilibrium and in the out-of-equilibrium regime, despite the two algorithms having fundamental differences (e.g.\ SGD does not satisfy detailed balance). Such equivalence allows us to use results about performances and limits of Monte Carlo algorithms to optimize the mini-batch size in the SGD-like algorithm and make it efficient at recovering the signal in hard inference problems.</description>

Abstract: SpiDy.jl solves the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of interacting classical spin vectors and harmonic oscillator networks in contact with a dissipative environment. The methods implemented allow the user to include arbitrary memory effects and colored quantum noise spectra. In this way, SpiDy.jl provides key tools for the simulation of classical and quantum open systems including non-Markovian effects and arbitrarily strong coupling to the environment. Among the wide range of applications, some examples range from atomistic spin dynamics to ultrafast magnetism and the study of anisotropic materials. We provide the user with Julia notebooks to guide them through the various mathematical methods and help them quickly set up complex simulations.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Baxter's TQ-relations and the QQ-system are systems of algebraic relations in the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra U_q(g^), which we established in our earlier works arXiv:1308.3444 and arXiv:1606.05301. In the present paper, we conjecture a family of analogous relations labeled by elements of the Weyl group W of g, so that the original relations correspond to the identity element. These relations are closely connected to the W-symmetry of q-characters established in arXiv:2211.09779. We prove these relations for all w in W if g has rank two, and we prove the extended TQ-relations if w is a simple reflection. We also generalize our results and conjectures to the shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from a cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
