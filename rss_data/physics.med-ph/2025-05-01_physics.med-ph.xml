      <title>Slug-Mapper: Magnetic Scanner for Ultra Low-Field MRI Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-Low Field (ULF) MRI scanners offer a portable and cost-effective alternative to conventional MRI systems, but require careful calibration to compensate for reduced magnetic field strength and signal quality. In this paper, we present Slug-Mapper, a low-cost, open-source magnetic field scanner designed to map the static field $B_0$ voxel-by-voxel within the bore of a ULF MRI system. Built using a repurposed 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi, and off-the-shelf components, Slug-Mapper enables high-resolution magnetic field characterization for both passive and active shimming. We provide a detailed overview of MRI physics, the engineering challenges of ULF systems, and the architecture and operation of Slug-Mapper. This tool bridges the gap between hardware prototyping and precise system calibration, supporting the development of accessible and portable MRI technology.</description>

      <title>The role of dendritic spines in water exchange measurements with diffusion MRI: Double Diffusion Encoding and free-waveform MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent diffusion MRI enables the estimation of water exchange rates in vivo, yet reported values in grey matter remain inconsistent. While most studies attribute these estimates to membrane permeability, non-permeative geometric exchange has also been proposed. The present study investigates the contribution of geometric exchange between dendritic spines and shafts to diffusion MRI-derived exchange estimates. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in synthetic dendrites with varying spine morphology, density, and membrane permeability. Diffusion-weighted signals were generated using multiple protocols - including single diffusion encoding, double diffusion encoding, and free waveforms - and were analysed using four frameworks: the K\"arger model (via kurtosis time-dependence), correlation tensor imaging, Restriction-Exchange, and Multi-Gaussian Exchange with transient kurtosis (tMGE). Dendritic spines were found to impart similar time-dependence signatures on the diffusion-weighted signal as permeative exchange (signal decrease with diffusion time). The effect was modulated by both spine morphology and density. Both the exchange rate and microscopic kurtosis increased with spine density. The tMGE method demonstrated the ability to disentangle geometric from permeative exchange. Non-permeative exchange in dendritic spines has a non-negligible impact on exchange estimates obtained with diffusion MRI and should be considered in future studies. Diffusion MRI exchange estimates may provide a non-invasive proxy for dendritic spine density, with potential applications in studies of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Characterization: A Multimodal Cross-Recurrence-Based Approach for Investigating Atrial Fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is believed to contribute significantly to atrial fibrillation (AF) development in certain patients. Recent studies indicate a rising risk of AF with increasing OSA severity. However, the commonly used apnea-hypopnea index in clinical practice may not adequately account for the potential cardiovascular risks associated with OSA. (1) Objective: to propose and explore a novel method for assessing OSA severity considering potential connection to cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Method: the approach utilizes cross-recurrence features to characterize OSA and AF by considering the relationships among oxygen desaturation, pulse arrival time, and heart-beat intervals. Multinomial logistic regression models were trained to predict four levels of OSA severity and four groups related to heart rhythm issues. The rank biserial correlation coefficient, rrb, was used to estimate effect size for statistical analysis. The investigation was conducted using the MESA database, which includes polysomnography data from 2055 subjects. (3) Results: a derived cross-recurrence-based index showed a significant association with a higher OSA severity (p &lt; 0.01) and the presence of AF (p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, the proposed index had a significantly larger effect, rrb, than the conventional apnea-hypopnea index in differentiating increasingly severe heart rhythm issue groups: 0.14 &gt; 0.06, 0.33 &gt; 0.10, and 0.41 &gt; 0.07. (4) Significance: the proposed method holds relevance as a supplementary diagnostic tool for assessing the authentic state of sleep apnea in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of In Vivo Subject-Specific Mechanical Modeling of the Optic Nerve Head for Robust Assessment of Ocular Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To establish the tissue regions necessary to accurately represent the mechanics of the optic nerve head (ONH), imaging data of the ONH from 2 healthy subjects were used to create in vivo subject-specific eye mechanical models considering distinct properties for all major ocular tissues. Tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the material properties and the inclusion of these tissues on the mechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC), retina, and optic nerve. Then, the LC mechanical response due to variations in intraocular and intracranial pressures was evaluated to validate the modeling approach. The sclera stiffness has the largest impact on the mechanics of the LC, retina, and optic nerve, while Bruchs membrane has a negligible effect on these tissues response. The validation tests showed increased LC strain with increased pressure and highest strains in the inferior and temporal subregion, as seen in literature studies. Consequently, accurate ONH mechanical representation can be obtained by only including those tissue regions identified as necessary.</description>

      <title>Light-Based Fast Timing in Bulk CsPbBr3 Crystals for TOF-PET and Proton Range Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskite semiconductors such as CsPbBr3 (CLB) are emerging gamma-ray detectors for applications requiring very high energy resolution and potential for fine detector segmentation. Semiconductor detectors typically offer poor time resolution due to the long drift times. Recently, we proposed to use the Cherenkov light component in partially transparent semiconductors to boost the timing capability of such detectors. Cherenkov light produced upon 511 keV gamma-ray interaction with CLB was investigated by means of optical simulations and experimental measurements. The timing capability of a pair of identical CLB crystals ( 3 x 3 x 5 mm3) coupled to NUV- MT silicon photomultipliers was measured. On average, 9.5 Cherenkov photons are produced in CLB between 555 and 900 nm for 511 keV photoelectric interactions based on our simulation framework. Experimentally, we observe 2-to-3 times more photons detected than in the simulation. The two most likely explanations for these additional detected optical photons are either the partial transparency of CLB in the UV, or a mild scintillation light emitted by CLB at room temperature. A coincidence time resolution (CTR) of 419 ps FWHM was obtained by triggering on more than 2 fired SiPM cells and after time walk correction. The measured CTR confirms the feasibility to use the Cherenkov light-component for fast timing applications on top of the charge readout, toward full 3D localization.</description>

      <title>Turning a Disposable Bronchoscope into a Dynamic Speckle Imaging Tool: Yes, It Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic speckle imaging, typically used in laser-illuminated surface diagnostics, has proven valuable for assessing biological activity. In this work, we demonstrate its feasibility in an endoscopic context using a disposable bronchoscope. Despite technical limitations and aliasing artifacts, our preliminary results show discernible vascular structures, indicating potential for minimally invasive diagnostic applications. It is important to note that the imaging systems used in this study are designed primarily for clinical robustness and classical imaging, including single-use sterility, ease of handling, and real-time visualization, and not for scientific fidelity of visual data or computational post-processing. As such, they are not inherently suited to dynamic speckle analysis, which requires precise control over temporal acquisition parameters, linear response characteristics of the imaging sensor, and stable illumination conditions, particularly from the coherent laser source. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that, even within these constraints, dynamic speckle imaging is indeed achievable. This opens the door to further adaptation and optimization of such clinical imaging tools for functional biomedical investigations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between MRI-based axon diameter and myelination estimates in macaque and human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axon diameter and myelin thickness affect the conduction velocity of action potentials in the nervous system. Imaging them non-invasively with MRI-based methods is thus valuable for studying brain microstructure and function. Electron microscopy studies suggest that axon diameter and myelin thickness are closely related to each other. However, the relationship between MRI-based estimates of these microstructural measures, known to be relative indices, have not been investigated across the brain mainly due to methodological limitations. In recent years, studies using ultra-high gradient strength diffusion MRI (dMRI) have demonstrated improved estimation of axon diameter index across white-matter (WM) tracts in the human brain, making such investigations feasible. In this study, we aim to investigate relationships between tissue microstructure properties across white-matter tracts, as estimated with MRI-based methods. We collected dMRI with ultra-high gradient strength and multi-echo spin-echo MRI on ex vivo macaque and human brain samples on a preclinical scanner. From these data, we found that the correlations between axon diameter index and other microstructural imaging parameters were weak but consistent across WM tracts in samples estimated with sufficient signal to noise ratio. In well-myelinated regions, tissue voxels with larger axon diameter indices were associated with lower packing density, lower MWF and a tendency of higher g-ratio. We also found that intra-axonal signal fractions and MWF were not consistently correlated when assessed in different samples. Overall, the findings suggest that MRI-based axon geometry and myelination measures can provide complementary information about fiber morphology, and the relationships between these measures agree with prior electron microscopy studies in smaller field of views.</description>

      <title>Microstructure.jl: a Julia Package for Probabilistic Microstructure Model Fitting with Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microstructure.jl is a Julia package designed for probabilistic estimation of tissue microstructural parameters from diffusion or combined diffusion-relaxometry MRI data. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for defining compartment models and includes robust and unified estimators for parameter fitting and uncertainty quantification. The package incorporates several established models from the literature, such as the spherical mean technique and soma and neurite density imaging (SANDI), along with their extensions for analyzing combined diffusion and T2 mapping data acquired at multiple echo times. For parameter estimation, it features methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and Monte Carlo dropout with neural networks, which provide probabilistic estimates by approximating the posterior distributions of model parameters. In this study, we introduce the major modules, functionality, and design of this package. We demonstrate its usage in optimizing acquisition protocols and evaluating model fitting performance with synthesized datasets. We also showcase practical applications with publicly available datasets. Microstructure.jl is applicable to in vivo and ex vivo imaging data acquired with typical research, high-performance, or pre-clinical scanners.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the Plan Aperture Modulation of Radiotherapy Treatment Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel metric, Plan Aperture Modulation (PAM), developed to quantify the modulation of radiotherapy treatment plans. PAM aims to provide a clear geometric interpretation, addressing the limitations of previous complexity metrics and facilitating its integration into treatment planning systems (TPSs) and clinical workflows. The PAM metric was defined as the average fraction of the target area outside the beam aperture, weighted over all control points in a treatment plan. The metric was evaluated in VMAT plans for two sites: prostate with lymph nodes and lung SBRT. Plans with varying complexities were generated using the Eclipse TPS, and PAM was compared to established metrics, including Plan Modulation (PM), Modulation Complexity Score (MCS), and monitor units per Gray (MU/Gy). The relationship between PAM and the Modulation Factor (MF), which quantifies the increase in MUs due to plan modulation, was also investigated. PAM provided a more intuitive assessment of plan modulation compared to the other metrics, and was validated across different delivery systems, such as C-arm linacs and Halcyon systems. The metric outperformed the previous metrics, indicated a zero modulation for Dynamic Conformal Arc plans, and was independent of confounding variables, such as treatment technique, beam energy, delivery system, and patient anatomy. Derived equations enabled the calculation of MF based on PAM, allowing for a robust quantification of plan modulation. PAM is a robust and intuitive metric for quantifying modulation in radiotherapy plans. It overcomes the limitations of previous metrics and can be readily implemented in TPSs to control plan modulation during optimization and for reporting. PAM is a promising tool for improving treatment planning workflows and for comparing and benchmarking radiotherapy plans in multi-institutional studies, clinical trials, and audits.</description>

      <title>Imaging neutrons with a position-sensitive monolithic CLYC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed and characterized a position-sensitive CLYC detector that acts as the neutron imaging layer and $\gamma$-ray Compton scatterer of the novel dual \g-ray and neutron imaging system GN-Vision, which aims at simultaneously obtaining information about the spatial origin of \g-ray and neutron sources. We first investigated the performance of large 50$\times$50~mm$^{2}$ monolithic CLYC crystals coupled to a pixelated SiPM in terms of energy resolution and neutron-gamma discrimination. The response of two different 95\% $^{6}$Li-enriched CLYC detectors coupled to an array of 8$\times$8 SiPMs was studied in comparison to the results of a conventional photo-multiplier tube. Energy resolution ranging from 6-8\% for the $^{137}$Cs peak and a figure of merit of 3-4 for the neutron-gamma discrimination have been obtained. The spatial response of the CLYC-SiPM detector to $\gamma$-rays and neutrons has also been characterized using charge modulation-based multiplexing techniques based on a diode-coupled charge division circuit. Average resolutions close to 5~mm FWHM with good linearity are obtained in the transverse crystal plane. Last, this work presents the first proof-of-concept experiments of the neutron imaging capability using a neutron pinhole collimator attached to the developed position sensitive CLYC detector.</description>
