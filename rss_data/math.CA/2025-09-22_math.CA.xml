      <title>Estimates of deviations of Fourier sums on Weyl-Nagy classes $W^r_{\beta,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish estimates for exact upper bounds of deviations of partial Fourier sums $S_{n-1}(f)$ on classes $W^r_{\beta,1}, r&gt;2, \beta\in\mathbb{R},$ of $2\pi$-periodic functions whose $(r,\beta)$-derivatives in the Weyl--Nagy sense belong to the unit ball of the space $L_1$. The specified estimates allow us to write asymptotic equalities for the quantities $\sup\limits_{f\in W^r_{\beta,1}}|f(x)-S_{n-1}(f;x)|$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, $r\rightarrow\infty$ for arbitrary relations between the parameters $r$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>A Note on the formulation of the Neumann boundary condition for a nonlocal problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlocal diffusion equation with continuous kernel $K(x,y$, with $ \int_{R} K(y,x) \, d \, y = 1$
  has been proposed as a model for some evolution process with diffusion, including population models. However, in general, we don't have $ \int_{\Omega} K(y,x) \, d \, y = 1$, as expected from its interpretation as a probability density.
  In this note, we propose a modification of the kernel, based on the idea of `reflection' at the boundary, familiar in one dimensional problems. We show that a similar construction is possible in higher dimensions, with the new kernel satisfying the above integral equality and being also symmetric in some special cases.</description>

      <title>On Tent Spaces for the Gaussian Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the scheme of tent spaces in classical harmonic analysis developed by R. Coifman, Y. Meyer, and E. Stein in \cite{cms}, we succeed in doing so for the Gaussian setting. In \cite{MNP}, part of this theory (an atomic decomposition) is developed for a specific tent space where functions are defined just in a proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+,$ and without the use of an area function. In the present paper, using a variation of the area function considered in \cite{FSU}, we define the Gaussian area function and Gaussian tent spaces and prove both their atomic decompositions and the characterization of their dual spaces. Some applications are also considered.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay of absolutely and H\"older continuous functions with infinitely or finitely many oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is, that if we suppose that a function is absolutely continuous and uniformly H\"older continuous and that its finite difference function does not oscillate infinitely often on a bounded interval, then the decay rate of its Fourier coefficients can be estimated exactly. This rate of decay predicts the same uniform H\"older continuity but the two other conditions are not necessary. Several examples from literature and by the author show that none of the assumptions can be relaxed without weakening the decay for some functions. The uniform H\"older continuity of chirps and the decay of their Fourier coefficients are studied. The main result is then applied in the estimation of the error of numerical Weyl fractional derivatives calculated using the discrete Fourier transform. The main result is also extended to Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Failure of weak-type endpoint restriction estimates for quadratic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Fourier extension operator for the paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be weak-type bounded at the restriction endpoint $q = 2d/(d-1)$, since such an estimate would imply bounds for the Kakeya maximal function which contradict the existence of Besicovitch sets. We generalize this approach to prove that the Fourier extension operator for an $n$-dimensional quadratic manifold $\mathcal{M}$ cannot be weak-type bounded at the restriction endpoint. The key step in this proof is constructing a set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ containing a translate of every plane normal to $\mathcal{M}$ which can be covered by $\lesssim \delta^{-d}\left(\frac{\log \log (1/\delta)}{\log (1/\delta)}\right)^{n/(d-n)}$ many $\delta$-balls. Such a set rules out endpoint bounds for the associated Kakeya maximal function and hence weak-type endpoint estimates for the restriction operator.</description>

      <title>Tensor Forms of Derivatives of Matrices and their applications in the Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors and matrices, and present some identities in terms of these products. We offer tensor expressions of derivatives of tensors, focus on the tensor forms of derivatives of a matrix w.r.t. another matrix. This tensor form makes possible for us to unify ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with partial differential equations (PDEs), and facilitates solution to them in some cases. For our purpose, we also extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors (matrices) to a more general case through any partition of the modes, present some identities in terms of these products, initialize the definition of partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) of a tensor, and use the partial TuckD to simplify the PDEs. We also present a tensor form for the Lyapunov function. Our results in the products of tensors and matrices help us to establish some important equalities on the derivatives of matrices and tensors. An algorithm based on the partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) to solve the PDEs is given, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spectral theoretic characterisation of Markov chain convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we characterise the statistics of Markov chains by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators. Studying the density of states of these operators reveals the absolutely continuous invariant measure of the Markov chain. This approach also leads to a direct proof of convergence to the invariant measure, along with explicit convergence rates. We show how our method can be applied to a class of related Markov chains including the logistic map, the tent map and Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order.</description>
