      <title>The cosmological analysis of X-ray cluster surveys: VI. Inference based on analytically simulated observable diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number density of galaxy clusters across mass and redshift has been established as a powerful cosmological probe. Cosmological analyses with galaxy clusters traditionally employ scaling relations. However, many challenges arise from this approach as the scaling relations are highly scattered, may be ill-calibrated, depend on the cosmology, and contain many nuisance parameters with low physical significance. In this paper, we use a simulation-based inference method utilizing artificial neural networks to optimally extract cosmological information from a shallow X-ray survey of galaxy clusters, solely using count rates (CR), hardness ratios (HR), and redshifts. This procedure enables us to conduct likelihood-free inference of cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_8$. We analytically generate simulations of galaxy cluster distribution in a CR, HR space in multiple redshift bins based on totally random combinations of cosmological and scaling relation parameters. We train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to retrieve the cosmological parameters from these simulations. We then use neural density estimation (NDE) neural networks to predict the posterior probability distribution of $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_8$ given an input galaxy cluster sample. The 1 $\sigma$ errors of our density estimator on one of the target testing simulations are 1000 deg$^2$: 15.2% for $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and 10.0% for $\sigma_8$; 10000 deg$^2$: 9.6% for $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and 5.6% for $\sigma_8$. We also compare our results with Fisher analysis. We demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that it is possible to calculate cosmological predictions of $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_8$ from a galaxy cluster population without explicitly computing cluster masses and even, the scaling relation coefficients, thus avoiding potential biases resulting from such a procedure.

      <title>Cosmological constraints from angular homogeneity scale measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new measurements of the angular homogeneity scale ($\theta_H$) from the BOSS DR12 and eBOSS DR16 catalogs of Luminous Red Galaxies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Considering the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we use the $\theta_H(z)$ data to constrain the matter density parameter ($\Omega_{m0}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). We find $H_0 = 65.7 \pm 7.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{m0}&gt;0.293$. By combining the $\theta_H$ measurements with current Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernova (SN) data, we obtain $H_{0}= 69.9^{+4.9}_{-4.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{m0} = 0.294^{+0.013}_{-0.015}$ ($\theta_H$ + BAO) and $H_{0}=70.7^{+5.2}_{-4.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{m0}=0.299 \pm 0.022$ ($\theta_H$ + SN). We show that $\theta_H$ measurements help break the BAO and SN degeneracies concerning $H_0$, as they do not depend on the sound horizon scale at the drag epoch or the SN absolute magnitude value obtained from the distance ladder method. Hence, despite those constraints being loose compared to other probes, $\theta_H$ data may provide an independent cosmological probe of $H_0$ in light of the Hubble tension. For completeness, we also forecast the constraining power of future $\theta_H$ data via Monte Carlo simulations. Considering a relative error of the order of 1$\%$, we obtain competitive constraints on $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ ($\approx 5\%$ error) from the joint analysis with current SN and BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most compelling pieces of evidence of the Hot Big Bang model is the realisation and confirmation that some nuclides were created shortly after the Big Bang. This process is referred to as Big Bang nucleosynthesis (or, sometimes, primordial nucleosynthesis), and is the end-product of putting neutrons and protons in a hot, expanding Universe. Big Bang nucleosynthesis currently provides our earliest test of cosmology, and it is the only experiment currently designed that is simultaneously sensitive to all four known fundamental forces: the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force. Our theoretical understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the measurement of the primordial abundances together represents one of the strongest pillars of the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, we will develop an intuitive understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, discuss modern calculations of this process, and provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art measurements that have been made. Overall, Big Bang nucleosynthesis is in remarkable agreement with various cosmological probes, and it is this agreement that serves to strengthen our confidence in the general picture of cosmology that we have today.</description>

      <title>CMB polarization non-Gaussianity from accreting primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) would induce non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by sourcing recombination perturbations spatially modulated by relative velocities between PBHs and the baryons they accrete. The leading non-Gaussian signatures are non-vanishing connected 4-point correlation functions, or trispectra. Earlier, we computed the CMB temperature trispectrum, and forecasted Planck to be more sensitive to it than to changes in the CMB temperature power spectrum for light enough PBHs. Excitingly, accreting PBHs would also induce non-Gaussianity in CMB polarization, and source both E and B modes, which we compute in this paper. We first calculate linear-response perturbations to the tensor-valued photon distribution function sourced by a general spatially-varying ionization history, and apply our results to accreting PBHs. We then compute linear-order perturbations to the temperature and polarization 2-point functions sourced by inhomogeneities in recombination due to accreting PBHs; we find them to be negligible relative to their counterparts sourced by homogeneous perturbations to the ionization history. Lastly, we compute all CMB trispectra including temperature, E- and B-mode polarization at linear order in the PBH abundance. We forecast that including polarization data in a 4-point-function analysis would only increase Planck's sensitivity to accreting PBHs by a factor ~2 relative to using temperature alone. As a consequence, we find that a search for PBHs using all temperature and polarization trispectra with Planck data would mostly not be competitive with current bounds from temperature and polarization power spectra. In contrast, we forecast that a CMB Stage-4 experiment would gain significant sensitivity to accreting PBHs through a 4-point-function search, in particular through the contributions of parity-odd trispectra including one B-mode field.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

      <title>Dual Gravitational Wave Signatures of Instant Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the instant preheating scenario efficient particle production occurs immediately following the period of inflationary expansion in the early Universe. We demonstrate that instant preheating predicts unique gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from two distinct origins. One source is the bremsstrahlung GWs produced through the decay of superheavy particles, an inevitable consequence of instant preheating. The other is GWs generated from the nonlinear dynamics of the inflaton and coupled scalar fields. Using numerical simulations, we show that the peak of the GW spectrum shifts depending on the coupling constants of the theory. The detection of these dual GW signatures, characteristic of instant preheating, provides novel opportunities for probing the dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference on an analytical model of the LISA massive black hole binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers will be detectable in large numbers by the Lisa Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which will thus provide new insights on how they form via repeated dark matter (DM) halo and galaxy mergers. Here we present a simple analytical model to generate a population of MBHB mergers based on a theoretical prescription that connects them to DM halo mergers. The high flexibility of our approach allows us to explore the broad and uncertain range of MBH seeding and growth mechanisms, as well as the different effects behind the interplay between MBH and galactic astrophysics. Such a flexibility is fundamental for the successful implementation and optimisation of the hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation approach that here we apply to the MBHB population of LISA for the first time. Our inferred population hyper-parameters are chosen as proxies to characterise the MBH--DM halo mass scaling relation, the occupation fraction of MBHs in DM halos and the delay between halo and MBHB mergers. We find that LISA will provide tight constraints at the lower-end of the MBH-halo scaling relation, well complementing EM observations which are biased towards large masses. Furthermore, our results suggest that LISA will constrain some features of the MBH occupation fraction at high redshift, as well as merger time delays of the order of a few hundreds of Myr, opening the possibility to constrain dynamical evolution time scales such as the dynamical friction. The analysis presented here constitutes a first attempt at developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach to the LISA MBHB population, opening the way for several further improvements and investigations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravity on all scales IV: 3x2pt Fisher forecasts for pixelised phenomenological modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage IV large scale structure surveys are promising probes of gravity on cosmological scales. Due to the vast model-space in the modified gravity literature, model-independent parameterisations represent useful and scalable ways to test extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we use a recently validated approach of computing the non-linear $3\times 2$pt observables in modified gravity models with a time-varying effective gravitational constant $\mu$ and a gravitational slip $\eta$ that is binned in redshift to produce Fisher forecasts for an LSST Y10-like survey. We also include in our modelling an effective nulling scheme for weak-lensing by applying the BNT transformation that localises the weak-lensing kernel enabling well-informed scale cuts. We show that the combination of improved non-linear modelling and better control of the scales that are modelled/cut yields high precision constraints on the cosmological and modified gravity parameters. We find that 4 redshift bins for $\mu$ of width corresponding to equal incremental $\Lambda$CDM growth is optimal given the state-of-the-art modelling and show how the BNT transformation can be used to mitigate the impact of small-scale systematic effects, such as baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>Improving redshift-space power spectra of halo intrinsic alignments from perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic alignments (IAs) of galaxies/halos observed via galaxy imaging survey, combined with redshift information, offer a novel probe of cosmology as a tracer of tidal force field of large-scale structure. In this paper, we present a perturbation theory based model for the redshift-space power spectra of galaxy/halo IAs that can keep the impact of Finger-of-God damping effect, known as a nonlinear systematics of redshift-space distortions, under control. Focusing particularly on galaxy/halo density and IA cross power spectrum, we derive analytically the explicit expressions for the next-to-leading order corrections. Comparing the model predictions with $N$-body simulations, we show that these corrections indeed play an important role for an unbiased determination of the growth-rate parameter, and hence the model proposed here can be used for a precision test of gravity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Effect of inelastic scattering on cosmic-ray-boosted dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter particles evade standard direct detection studies since their typical energies in the galactic halo do not allow for detectable recoil of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. However, it was noted that if the dark matter particles have sizable couplings to nucleons, they can be boosted by interactions with galactic cosmic rays and probed by experiments like Xenon-1T. We revisit the resulting bounds on DM-nucleon interaction and improve on previous works by considering the DM-nucleus inelastic cross sections provided by the GENIE interaction event generator. Including inelastic scattering in the process of dark matter boosting increases the flux of high-energy dark matter coming to Earth. Additionally, allowing for inelastic scattering with nuclei is important for a realistic description of the dark matter interacting in the Earth's crust. We demonstrate these effects on a benchmark model where dark matter interactions are mediated by a dark U(1) vector boson.</description>

      <title>Dust-UV offsets in high-redshift galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn III simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial offsets between dust and ultraviolet (UV) emission in high-redshift galaxies using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation. Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at z=5-7, compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. Our simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model, naturally reproduces these offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies (log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm{DM}}$/M$_{\odot}$)&gt;11.5, M$_{\rm{AB1500}}$&lt;-20). We find that dust-UV offsets increase with halo mass and UV brightness, reaching up to $\sim 2$ pkpc for the most massive systems, in good agreement with observational data from the ALPINE and REBELS surveys. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. The dust remains well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between star formation, dust distribution, and observed galaxy morphologies during the epoch of reionization, highlighting the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing No slip model with pulsar timing arrays: NANOGrav and IPTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an observational study of modified gravity considering a potential inflationary interpretation of pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We use a motivated model known as no slip in which the gravitational wave propagation is modified. Specifically, by using two different parametrizations for the model, we find the approximate transfer functions for tensor perturbations. In this way, we obtain the spectral energy density of gravitational waves and use NANOGrav and IPTA second data release to constrain parameters of the model. We find that there is degeneracy between the model parameters $\xi$ and $c_M$. For $c_M$, we only get an upper bound on the parameter. Thus, it is difficult to constrain them with percent level accuracy with the current PTA data.</description>

Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization Spectrometer (EoR-Spec) is an upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) instrument designed to study the evolution of the early universe (z = 3.5 to 8) by probing the redshifted [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line from aggregates of galaxies. The [CII] emission is an excellent tracer of star formation since it is the dominant cooling line from neutral gas heated by OB star light and thus can be used to probe the reionization of the early Universe due to star formation. EoR-Spec will be deployed on Prime-Cam, a modular direct-detection receiver for the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), currently under construction by CPI Vertex Antennentechnik GmbH and to be installed near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert. This instrument features an image plane populated with more than 6500 Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that are illuminated by a 4-lens optical design with a cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) at the pupil of the optical system. The FPI is designed to provide a spectral resolving power of $R\sim100$ over the full spectral range of 210--420 GHz. EoR-Spec will tomographically survey the E-COSMOS and E-CDFS fields with a depth of about 4000 hours over a 5 year period. Here we give an update on EoR-Spec's final mechanical/optical design and the current status of fabrication, characterization and testing towards first light in 2026.</description>

      <title>Spin of Primordial Black Holes from Broad Power Spectrum: Radiation Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a study to obtain the initial spin or the nondimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ of primordial black holes (PBHs) created during the radiation dominated phase of the universe from not only nearly monochromatic but also broad curvature power spectra. Motivated by inflation and first-order phase transitions, we consider a power law shape for the curvature perturbation. Although we can naturally neglect the contribution from the length scales smaller than the scale of interest, that from the larger scales may potentially be significant for a broad power spectrum, for which the spin is sensitive to the width of the power spectrum. So, we introduce a width parameter $r_{k}$, the ratio of the largest scale to the length of interest. We find that the root mean square of $a_{*}$ is largest for PBHs created from locally nearly scale invariant curvature power spectra with $r_{k} \sim 3.5$. The upper limit is $\sim 1\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=10^{17}-10^{23}$ g,
  $\sim 1.7\times 10^{-4}$ for $M=1-100 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 2.5\times 10^{-3}$ even for an incredibly large mass of $M=10^{50}$ g.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent prediction of gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions are novel probes of fundamental physics, making their precise calculation essential for revealing various mysteries of the early Universe. In this work we propose a framework that enables the consistent calculation of such gravitational waves sourced by sound waves. Starting from the Lagrangian, this framework integrates the calculation of the dynamics of first-order phase transitions in a self-consistent manner, eliminating various approximations typically introduced by conventional methods. At the heart of our approach is the congruous evaluation of the phase transition hydrodynamics that, at every step, is consistently informed by the Lagrangian. We demonstrate the application of our framework using the SM+$|H|^6$ model, deriving the corresponding gravitational wave spectrum. Our framework establishes a robust foundation for the precise prediction of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Testing the coupling of dark radiations in light of the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are studying the effects of Self-Interacting dark radiation (SIdr) on the evolution of the universe. Our main focus is on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and how SIdr could potentially help resolve the Hubble tension. We are looking into different scenarios by mixing SIdr with Free-Streaming dark radiation (FSdr) or not to determine whether SIdr can indeed contribute to solving the Hubble tension. We find that SIdr alone can increase the Hubble constant ($H_0$) to $70.1_{-1.6}^{+1.3}, \text{km/s/Mpc}$ with a value of $N_{\rm eff}=3.27_{-0.31}^{+0.23}$. However, including \lzy{FSdr} disfavors the existence of SIdr $\tilde N_{\rm si}\approx0.37$. Even though the Hubble constant is increased compared to the predicted value, it entails $N_{\rm eff}=3.52\pm0.25$. Finally, we implement the Fisher method for future experiments and a $7.64\sigma$ measurement of $\tilde N_{\rm si}$ will be obtained when combing data from Planck, AliCPT, and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: constraints on single field inflation from BOSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative, or effective field theory (EFT)-based, full-shape analyses of galaxy clustering data involve ``nuisance parameters'' to capture various observational effects such as the galaxy-dark matter connection (galaxy bias). We present an efficient approach to set informative physically motivated priors on these parameters. We extract these priors from simulated galaxy catalogs based on halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. First, we build a joint distribution between EFT galaxy bias and HOD parameters from a set of 10,500 HOD mock catalogs. We use the field level EFT technique that allows for cosmic variance cancellation, enabling a precision calibration of EFT parameters from computationally inexpensive small-volume simulations. Second, we use neural density estimators -- normalizing flows -- to model the marginal probability density of the EFT parameters, which can be used as a prior distribution in full shape analyses. As a first application, we use our HOD-based priors in a new analysis of galaxy power spectra and bispectra from the BOSS survey in the context of single field primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that our priors lead to a reduction of the posterior volume of bias parameters by an order of magnitude. We also find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil} = 320\pm 300$ and $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm ortho} = 100\pm 130$ (at 68\% CL) in a combined two-template analysis, representing a $\approx 40\%$ improvement in constraints on single field primordial non-Gaussianity, equivalent to doubling the survey volume.</description>

      <title>The 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Power Spectrum from eBOSS DR16</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the three-dimensional power spectrum (P3D) of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-a (Ly-a) forest using the complete extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey data release 16 (eBOSS DR16). This sample consists of 205,012 quasar spectra in the redshift range 2 &lt;= z &lt;= 4 at an effective redshift z=2.334. We propose a pair-count spectral estimator in configuration space, weighting each pair by exp(ikr), for wave vector k and pixel pair separation r, effectively measuring the anisotropic power spectrum without the need for fast Fourier transforms. This accounts for the window matrix in a tractable way, avoiding artifacts found in Fourier-transform based power spectrum estimators due to the sparse sampling transverse to the line-of-sight of Ly-a skewers. We extensively test our pipeline on two sets of mocks: (i) idealized Gaussian random fields with a sparse sampling of Ly-a skewers, and (ii) log-normal LyaCoLoRe mocks including realistic noise levels, the eBOSS survey geometry and contaminants. On eBOSS DR16 data, the Kaiser formula with a non-linear correction term obtained from hydrodynamic simulations yields a good fit to the power spectrum data in the range 0.02 &lt;= k &lt;= 0.35 h/Mpc at the 1-2 sigma level with a covariance matrix derived from LyaCoLoRe mocks. We demonstrate a promising new approach for full-shape cosmological analyses of Ly-a forest data from cosmological surveys such as eBOSS, the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and future surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph, WEAVE-QSO and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>The DEHVILS in the Details: Type Ia Supernova Hubble Residual Comparisons and Mass Step Analysis in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) have been used both as an alternate path to cosmology compared to optical measurements and as a method of constraining key systematics for the larger optical studies. With the DEHVILS sample, the largest published NIR sample with consistent NIR coverage of maximum light across three NIR bands ($Y$, $J$, and $H$), we check three key systematics: (i) the reduction in Hubble residual scatter as compared to the optical, (ii) the measurement of a "mass step" or lack thereof and its implications, and (iii) the ability to distinguish between various dust models by analyzing slopes and correlations between Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical. We produce SN Ia simulations of the DEHVILS sample and find that it is $\textit{harder}$ to differentiate between various dust models than previously understood. Additionally, we find that fitting with the current SALT3-NIR model does not yield accurate wavelength-dependent stretch-luminosity correlations, and we propose a limited solution for this problem. From the data, we see that (i) the standard deviation of Hubble residual values from NIR bands treated as standard candles are 0.007-0.042 mag smaller than those in the optical, (ii) the NIR mass step is not constrainable with the current sample size of 47 SNe Ia from DEHVILS, and (iii) Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical are correlated in the data. We test a few variations on the number and combinations of filters and data samples, and we observe that none of our findings or conclusions are significantly impacted by these modifications.</description>

      <title>Testing the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM Cosmological Model with Forthcoming Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with SPT-3G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and 12 $\mu{\rm K-arcmin}$, respectively, in CMB temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ~1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level ~$\sqrt{\text{2}}$ times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential bandpowers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization bandpowers. We demonstrate the ability to test the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ~2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dominated Cosmology with Woods-Saxon Like Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark energy can be characterized by a canonical scalar field, known as quintessence. Quintessence allows for a dynamical equation of state $-1 \le \omega \le -\frac{1}{3}$. A previous study by Oikonomou and Chatzarakis have shown that a scalar field model with a Woods-Saxon like potential can successfully explain the early inflation. In this work, we consider a quintessence model with a potential of similar form to explain the late time acceleration. The model is studied at late phase assuming flat cosmology, and the model parameters are constrained using Type Ia supernova data and Observational Hubble data. In particular we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for the Bayesian inference of these parameters. We obtain the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 \sim 68 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and the matter energy density parameter $\Omega_{m_0} \sim 0.30 $, which are in close agreement with the values obtained from the Planck CMB data, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model. Computation of the $\chi^2_{min}$, AIC and BIC reveal that this model is slightly preferred according to AIC and $\chi^2_{min}$ criteria, while the $\Lambda$CDM is preferred according to BIC. We demonstrate that the model possesses a stable attractor in the asymptotic future, which confirms the dynamical stability of the model. Thus, this model may be considered as a potential alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-based halo model for large scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of the one-to-two halo transition has long been difficult to achieve. We demonstrate that physically motivated halo definitions that respect the bimodal phase-space distribution of dark matter particles near halos resolves this difficulty. Specifically, the two phase-space components are overlapping and correspond to: 1) particles \it orbiting \rm the halo; and 2) particles \it infalling \rm into the halo for the first time. Motivated by this decomposition, Garc\'ia [R. Garc\'ia et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] advocated for defining haloes as the collection of particles orbiting their self-generated potential. This definition identifies the traditional one-halo term of the halo--mass correlation function with the distribution of orbiting particles around a halo, while the two-halo term governs the distribution of infalling particles. We use dark matter simulations to demonstrate that the distribution of orbiting particles is finite and can be characterised by a single physical scale $r_{\rm h}$, which we refer to as the \it halo radius. \rm The two-halo term is described using a simple yet accurate empirical model based on the Zel'dovich correlation function. We further demonstrate that the halo radius imprints itself on the distribution of infalling particles at small scales. Our final model for the halo--mass correlation function is accurate at the $\approx 2\%$ level for $r \in [0.1,50]\ h^{-1}\ Mpc$. The Fourier transform of our best fit model describes the halo--mass power spectrum with comparable accuracy for $k\in [0.06, 6.0]\ h\ Mpc^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the "acceleration-plane analysis" for a variety of samples and the "stacked velocity profile analysis" for a pure binary sample.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}^2$ effectively from Inflation to Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Capture of Dark Matter by Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the dense environment, neutron stars (NSs) can serve as an ideal laboratory for studying the interactions between dark matter (DM) and ordinary matter. In the process of DM capture, deep inelastic scattering may dominate over elastic scattering, especially for the DM with a large momentum transfer. In this work, we calculate DM-nucleon deep inelastic scattering via a vector mediator and estimate its contribution to the capture rate. Using the surface temperature of the NSs, we derive the exclusion limits for the DM-nucleon scattering cross section in the mass range, $1~{\rm GeV}&lt;m_{\chi}&lt; 10^{5}~{\rm GeV}$. We find the bounds for DM with the mass $\gtrsim$ 1 GeV can be changed several times after including the deep inelastic scattering contribution.</description>

      <title>Properties of Central Regions of the Dark Matter Halos in the Model with a Bump in the Power Spectrum of Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surprisingly large number of galaxies with masses of $\sim10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z\geq9$ are discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope. A possible explanation for the increase in the mass function can be the presence of a local maximum (bump) in the power spectrum of density perturbations on the corresponding scale. In this paper, it is shown that simultaneously with the growth of the mass function, galaxies from the bump region must have a higher density (compactness) compared to cosmological models without a bump. These more compact galaxies have been partially included in larger galaxies and have been subjected to tidal gravitational disruption. They have been less destructed than ``ordinary'' galaxies of the same mass, and some of them could survive to $z = 0$ and persist on the periphery of some galaxies. The formation and evolution of compact halos in a cube with a volume of $(47 \,\text{Mpc})^3$ with $(1024)^3$ dark matter particles in the redshift range from 120 to 0 have been numerically simulated and observational implications of the presence of such galaxies in the current Universe have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis in a bouncing model with dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>
