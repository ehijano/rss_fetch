      <title>Cluster GARCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate GARCH model with flexible convolution-t distributions that is applicable in high-dimensional systems. The model is called Cluster GARCH because it can accommodate cluster structures in the conditional correlation matrix and in the tail dependencies. The expressions for the log-likelihood function and its derivatives are tractable, and the latter facilitate a score-drive model for the dynamic correlation structure. We apply the Cluster GARCH model to daily returns for 100 assets and find it outperforms existing models, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, the convolution-t distribution provides a better empirical performance than the conventional multivariate t-distribution.</description>

      <title>A Multi-step Approach for Minimizing Risk in Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07200v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Exchanges are becoming even more predominant in today's finance. Driven by the need to study this phenomenon from an academic perspective, the SIAG/FME Code Quest 2023 was announced. Specifically, participating teams were asked to implement, in Python, the basic functions of an Automated Market Maker and a liquidity provision strategy in an Automated Market Maker to minimize the Conditional Value at Risk, a critical measure of investment risk. As the competition's winning team, we highlight our approach in this work. In particular, as the dependence of the final return on the initial wealth distribution is highly non-linear, we cannot use standard ad-hoc approaches. Additionally, classical minimization techniques would require a significant computational load due to the cost of the target function. For these reasons, we propose a three-step approach. In the first step, the target function is approximated by a Kernel Ridge Regression. Then, the approximating function is minimized. In the final step, the previously discovered minimum is utilized as the starting point for directly optimizing the desired target function. By using this procedure, we can both reduce the computational complexity and increase the accuracy of the solution. Finally, the overall computational load is further reduced thanks to an algorithmic trick concerning the returns simulation and the usage of Cython.</description>
