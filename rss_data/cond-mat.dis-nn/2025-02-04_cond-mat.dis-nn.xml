      <title>Universal fluctuations of localized two interacting particles in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Minkowski tensors for voxelized data: robust, asymptotically unbiased estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minkowski tensors, also known as tensor valuations, provide robust $n$-point information for a wide range of random spatial structures. Local estimators for voxelized data, however, are unavoidably biased even in the limit of infinitely high resolution. Here, we substantially improve a recently proposed, asymptotically unbiased algorithm to estimate Minkowski tensors for voxelized data. Our improved algorithm is more robust and efficient. Moreover we generalize the theoretical foundations for an asymptotically bias-free estimation of the interfacial tensors to the case of finite unions of compact sets with positive reach, which is relevant for many applications like rough surfaces or composite materials. As a realistic test case, we consider, among others, random (beta) polytopes. We first derive explicit expressions of the expected Minkowski tensors, which we then compare to our simulation results. We obtain precise estimates with relative errors of a few percent for practically relevant resolutions. Finally, we apply our methods to real data of metallic grains and nanorough surfaces, and we provide an open-source python package, which works in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits of learning in sequence multi-index models and deep attention networks: High-dimensional asymptotics and sharp thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the learning of deep attention neural networks, defined as the composition of multiple self-attention layers, with tied and low-rank weights. We first establish a mapping of such models to sequence multi-index models, a generalization of the widely studied multi-index model to sequential covariates, for which we establish a number of general results. In the context of Bayesian-optimal learning, in the limit of large dimension $D$ and commensurably large number of samples $N$, we derive a sharp asymptotic characterization of the optimal performance as well as the performance of the best-known polynomial-time algorithm for this setting --namely approximate message-passing--, and characterize sharp thresholds on the minimal sample complexity required for better-than-random prediction performance. Our analysis uncovers, in particular, how the different layers are learned sequentially. Finally, we discuss how this sequential learning can also be observed in a realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Josephson microwave photon detector operating at 0.7 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict that the threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions, with critical currents below 100 nA, exhibiting a phase diffusion regime, can be exploited for the microwave photon detection both at 17 mK and 700 mK. We demonstrate a detection of two- and one-photon energies at 5 GHz with 90% and 15% efficiency and dark count time of about 0.1 s and 0.01 s, respectively. The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mean-Field Theory for Continuous Random Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. We also studied a toy model of a continuous Gaussian network with a continuous phase transition. This behavior matches the critical brain hypothesis, which states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Tree networks of real-world data: analysis of efficiency and spatiotemporal scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <title>Bethe $M$-layer construction for the percolation problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in model biological tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</description>
