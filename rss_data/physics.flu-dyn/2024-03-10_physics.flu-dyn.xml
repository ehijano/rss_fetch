      <title>Quantum-Based Salp Swarm Algorithm Driven Design Optimization of Savonius Wind Turbine-Cylindrical Deflector System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Savonius turbines, prominent in small-scale wind turbine applications operating under low-speed conditions, encounter limitations due to opposing torque on the returning blade, impeding high efficiency. A viable solution involves mitigating this retarding torque by directing incoming airflow through a cylindrical deflector. However, such flow control is highly contingent upon the location and size of the cylindrical deflector, and its angular velocity. This study introduces a novel design optimization framework tailored for enhancing the turbine-deflector system's performance. Leveraging surrogate models for computational efficiency, six different models were assessed, with Kriging selected for subsequent analysis based on its superior performance at approximating the relation between design parameters and objective function. The training data for the surrogate model and the flow field data around the system were obtained through Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) simulations using a sliding mesh technique. An in-house code for the Quantum-based Salp Swarm Optimization (QSSO) algorithm was then employed to obtain design parameters corresponding to the peak power coefficient (Cp) for the stationary deflector-turbine system. Additionally, the QSSO algorithm was quantitatively compared with nine other competing algorithms. The optimized stationary deflector-turbine system showed an improvement of 26.94% in Cp at Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) of 0.9 compared to the baseline case. Further investigation into the effect of deflector rotational velocity ($\omega_d$) revealed significant improvements: 40.98% and 11.33% enhancement at $\omega_d$ = 3 rad/s, and 51.23% and 19.42% at $\omega_d$ = 40 rad/s, compared to configurations without a deflector and with the optimized stationary deflector, respectively at a TSR of 0.9.</description>

      <title>Lee-Wave Energy Sinks in Bottom-Intensified Flow: Reabsorption, Dissipation and Nonlinear Spectral Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Idealized numerical simulation is used to explore energy sinks for lee waves trapped in their bottom-intensified generating flow. In addition to the loss to explicit dissipation and reabsorption predicted by linear wave action conservation, indirect dissipation due to a nonlinear forward cascade by parametric subharmonic instability represents a significant sink that substantially reduces reabsorption. The partition of lee-wave energy loss between reabsorption and (explicit plus indirect) dissipation is independent of subgridscale damping parameterization. Remote dissipation of freely propagating internal waves generated by shear instability at the lee-wave critical layer proves to be small. A general parameterization for lee-wave dissipation of the balanced flow requires a more complete exploration of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Langmuir turbulence in suspended kelp farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of suspended kelp farms on ocean mixed layer hydrodynamics in the presence of currents and waves. We use the large eddy simulation method, where the wave effect is incorporated by solving the wave-averaged equations. Distinct Langmuir circulation patterns are generated within various suspended farm configurations, including horizontally uniform kelp blocks and spaced kelp rows. Intensified turbulence arises from the farm-generated Langmuir circulation, as opposed to the standard Langmuir turbulence observed without a farm. The creation of Langmuir circulation within the farm is attributed to two primary factors depending on farm configuration: (1) enhanced vertical shear due to kelp frond area density variability, and (2) enhanced lateral shear due to canopy discontinuity at lateral edges of spaced rows. Both enhanced vertical and lateral shear of streamwise velocity, representing the lateral and vertical vorticity components respectively, can be tilted into downstream vorticity to create Langmuir circulation. This vorticity tilting is driven by the Craik- Leibovich vortex force associated with the Stokes drift of surface gravity waves. In addition to the farm-generated Langmuir turbulence, canopy shear layer turbulence is created at the farm bottom edge due to drag discontinuity. The intensity of different types of turbulence depends on both kelp frond area density and the geometric configuration of the farm. The farm-generated turbulence has substantial consequences for nutrient supply and kelp growth. These findings also underscore the significance of the presence of obstacle structures in modifying ocean mixed layer characteristics.</description>

      <title>Prediction of turbulent energy based on low-rank resolvent modes and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modelling framework based on the resolvent analysis and machine learning is proposed to predict the turbulent energy in incompressible channel flows. In the framework, the optimal resolvent response modes are selected as the basis functions modelling the low-rank behaviour of high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent flow-fields, and the corresponding weight functions are determined by data-driven neural networks. Turbulent-energy distribution in space and scales, at the friction Reynolds number 1000, is predicted and compared to the data of direct numerical simulation. Close agreement is observed, suggesting the feasibility and reliability of the proposed framework for turbulence prediction.</description>

      <title>Freezing delay of a drop impacting on a monolayer of cold grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a subfreezing droplet impact scenario in a low-humidity environment, where the target is a cold granular monolayer. When the undercooling degree of targets passes a threshold, such a granular layer effectively postpones the bulk freezing time of the droplet in comparison with the impact on the bare substrate underneath. In this case, the retraction of the droplet after impact reduces the contact area with the cold substrate, even though both the grains and the substrate are wettable to the liquid. We find that the significant changes in the dynamic behavior are triggered by freezing the liquid that wets the pores. Owing to the small dimension of the pores, the freezing process is rapid enough to match the dynamics over the droplet dimension. In certain circumstances, the rapid freezing may even stop liquid penetration and shed icing from the underneath surface.</description>

      <title>Investigating the shortcomings of the Flow Convergence Method for quantification of mitral regurgitation in a pulsatile in-vitro environment and with Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow convergence method includes calculation of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) and is widely used to classify mitral regurgitation (MR) with echocardiography. It constitutes a primary decision factor for determination of treatment and should therefore be a robust quantification method. However, it is known for its tendency to underestimate MR and its dependence on user expertise. The present work systematically compares different pulsatile flow profiles arising from different regurgitation orifices using transesophageal chocardiographic probe and particle image velocimetry (PIV) as a reference in an in-vitro environment. It has been found that the inter-observer variability using echocardiography is small compared to the systematic underestimation of the regurgitation volume for large orifice areas (up to 52%) where a violation of the flow convergence method assumptions occurs. From a flow perspective, a starting vortex was found as a dominant flow pattern in the regurgant jet for all orifice shapes and sizes. A series of simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations indicate that selecting a suboptimal aliasing velocity during echocardiography measurements might be a primary source of potential underestimation in MR characterization via the PISA-based method, reaching up to 40%. It has been noted in clinical observations that physicians often select an aliasing velocity higher than necessary for optimal estimation in diagnostic procedures.</description>

      <title>Predicting burst events in a forced 2D flow: A wavelet-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and perhaps mitigating against rare, extreme events in fluid flows is an important challenge. Due to the time-localized nature of these events, Fourier-based methods prove inefficient in capturing them. Instead this paper uses wavelet-based methods to understand the underlying patterns in a forced flow over a 2-torus which has intermittent high-energy burst events interrupting an ambient low energy quiet flow. Three methods are examined to predict burst events: (1) a straightforward energy tracking approach which acts as the benchmark; (2) a wavelet proper orthogonal decomposition (WPOD) which uncovers the key flow patterns seen in the quiet regions and the bursting episodes; and (3) a wavelet resolvent analysis (WRA) that reveals the forcing structures that amplifies the underlying flow patterns. Both the wavelet-based approaches succeed in producing better (earlier) predictions than a simple energy criterion, with the WRA-based technique always bettering WPOD. However, both also produce false positives and the improvement of the WRA approach over WPOD is not as substantial as anticipated. We conjecture that this is because the mechanism for the bursts in the flow studied is found to be largely modal associated with the unstable eigenfunction of the Navier-Stokes operator linearized around the mean flow. The forcing approach should deliver much better improvements over the WPOD approach for generically non-modal bursting mechanisms where there is a lag between the imposed forcing and the final response pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Leidenfrost drops exhibit erratic bubble bursts to release vapor accumulated beneath the liquid, becoming amorphous and unstable. Here we report an original and remarkably simple method to stabilize and design a Leidenfrost puddle. When a thin hydrophilic layer with a suitable design is placed over the liquid, the puddle adopts the layer shape due to adhesive forces and becomes stable. We show a wide variety of designs obtained using this method. Moreover, we determine the required layer dimensions to stabilize puddles, the wetting and floating conditions, and a model for the evaporation rate of the designed drops. Finally, potential applications are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of a stochastic dynamics leading to cascades and loss of regularity: applications to fluid turbulence and generation of fractional Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the modeling of the spatial structure of the velocity field of three-dimensional turbulent flows, and the phenomenology of cascade phenomena, a linear dynamics has been recently proposed able to generate high velocity gradients from a smooth-in-space forcing term. It is based on a linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) stirred by an additive random forcing term which is delta-correlated in time. The underlying proposed deterministic mechanism corresponds to a transport in Fourier space which aims at transferring energy injected at large scales towards small scales. The key role of the random forcing is to realize these transfers in a statistically homogeneous way. Whereas at finite times and positive viscosity the solutions are smooth, a loss of regularity is observed for the statistically stationary state in the inviscid limit. We here present novel simulations, based on finite volume methods in the Fourier domain and a splitting method in time, which are more accurate than the pseudo-spectral simulations. We show that the novel algorithm is able to reproduce accurately the expected local and statistical structure of the predicted solutions. We conduct numerical simulations in one, two and three spatial dimensions, and we display the solutions both in physical and Fourier spaces. We additionally display key statistical quantities such as second-order structure functions and power spectral densities at various viscosities.</description>

      <title>Exponential asymptotics and Stokes surfaces in nonlinear three-dimensional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we seek to expand the scope of work done by Lustri and Chapman (2013) in modelling 3D flow past a point source, in order to account for more general flows, where the strength of such a source, $\delta$, is now $O(1)$. We find that in order to solve for the Stokes surfaces of this nonlinear system, we must develop a numerical scheme to shoot from the analytically continued free surface into real space. The principal contribution of this work is a demonstration of the disparity between the line of intersection found by Lustri and Chapman (2013) and that found by our own nonlinear numerical method, along with proposed extensions for further avenues of research e.g. including surface tension.</description>

      <title>Accelerating high order discontinuous Galerkin solvers through a clustering-based viscous/turbulent-inviscid domain decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the unsupervised clustering technique introduced in [25] to identify viscous/turbulent from inviscid regions in incompressible flows. The separation of regions allows solving the Navier-Stokes equations including Large Eddy Simulation closure models only in the viscous/turbulent ones, while solving the Euler equations in the remaining of the computational domain. By solving different sets of equations, the computational cost is significantly reduced. This coupling strategy is implemented within a discontinuous Galerkin numerical framework, which allows discontinuous solutions (i.e., different set of equations) in neighbouring elements that interact through numerical fluxes. The proposed strategy maintains the same accuracy at lower cost, when compared to solving the full Navier-Stokes equations throughout the entire domain. Validation of this approach is conducted across diverse flow regimes, spanning from unsteady laminar flows to unsteady turbulent flows, including an airfoil section at Reynolds numbers Re = 103 and 104 and large angles of attack, and the flow past a wind turbine, modelled using actuator lines. The computational cost is reduced by 25% and 29% for the unsteady turbulent flow around an airfoil section and the flow past the wind turbine, respectively. In addition, to further accelerate the simulations, we combine the proposed decoupling with local P -adaptation, as proposed in [ 30]. When doing so, we reduce the computational cost by 41% and 45% for the flow around the airfoil section and the flow past the wind turbine, respectively</description>

      <title>Physics-based distinction of nonequilibrium effects in near-wall modeling of turbulent separation bubble with and without sweep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-gradient-induced separation of swept and unswept turbulent boundary layers, based on the DNS studies of Coleman et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 2018 &amp; 2019), have been analyzed for various nonequilibrium effects. The goal is to isolate physical processes critical to near-wall flow modeling. The decomposition of skin friction into contributing physical terms, proposed by Renard and Deck (J. Fluid Mech. 2016) (short: RD decomposition), affords several key insights into the near-wall physics of these flows. In the unswept case, spatial growth term (encapsulating nonequilibrium effects) and TKE production appear to be the dominant contributing terms in the RD decomposition in the separated and pressure-gradient zones, but a closer inspection reveals that only the spatial growth term dominates in the inner layer close to the separation bubble, implying a strong need for incorporating nonequilibrium terms in the wall modeling of this case. The comparison of streamwise RD decomposition of swept and unswept cases shows that a larger accumulated Clauser-pressure-gradient parameter history in the latter energizes the outer dynamics in the APG, leading to diminished separation bubble size in the unswept case. The spanwise RD decomposition in the swept case indicates that the downstream spanwise flow largely retains the upstream ZPG characteristics. This seems to ease the near-wall modeling challenge in the separated region, especially for basic models with an inherent log-law assumption. Wall-modeled LES of the swept and unswept cases are then performed using three wall models, validating many of the modeling implications from the DNS. In particular, the extension of RD decomposition to wall models underpins the criticality of spatial growth term close to the separation bubble, and the corresponding superior predictions by the PDE wall model due to its accurate capturing of this term.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating dynamics of ellipsoidal particles using lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic particles are often encountered in different fields of soft matter and complex fluids. In this work, we present an implementation of the coupled hydrodynamics of solid ellipsoidal particles and the surrounding fluid using the lattice Boltzmann method. A standard link-based mechanism is used to implement the solid-fluid boundary conditions. We develop an implicit method to update the position and orientation of the ellipsoid. This exploits the relations between the quaternion which describes the ellipsoid's orientation and the ellipsoid's angular velocity to obtain a stable and robust dynamic update. The proposed algorithm is validated by looking at four scenarios: (i) the steady translational velocity of a spheroid subject to an external force in different orientations, (ii) the drift of an inclined spheroid subject to an imposed force, (iii) three-dimensional rotational motions in a simple shear flow (Jeffrey's orbits), and (iv) developed fluid flows and self-propulsion exhibited by a spheroidal microswimmer. In all cases the comparison of numerical results showed good agreement with known analytical solutions, irrespective of the choice of the fluid properties, geometrical parameters, and lattice Boltzmann model, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Moving Discontinuous Galerkin Method with Interface Condition Enforcement for the Simulation of Hypersonic, Viscous Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moving discontinuous Galerkin method with interface condition enforcement (MDG-ICE) is a high-order, r-adaptive method that treats the grid as a variable and weakly enforces the conservation law, constitutive law, and corresponding interface conditions in order to implicitly fit high-gradient flow features. In this paper, we develop an optimization solver based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that features an anisotropic, locally adaptive penalty method to enhance robustness and prevent cell degeneration in the computation of hypersonic, viscous flows. Specifically, we incorporate an anisotropic grid regularization based on the mesh-implied metric that inhibits grid motion in directions with small element length scales, an element shape regularization that inhibits nonlinear deformations of the high-order elements, and a penalty regularization that penalizes degenerate elements. Additionally, we introduce a procedure for locally scaling the regularization operators in an adaptive, elementwise manner in order to maintain grid validity. We apply the proposed MDG-ICE formulation to two- and three-dimensional test cases involving viscous shocks and/or boundary layers, including Mach 17.6 hypersonic viscous flow over a circular cylinder and Mach 5 hypersonic viscous flow over a sphere, which are very challenging test cases for conventional numerical schemes on simplicial grids. Even without artificial dissipation, the computed solutions are free from spurious oscillations and yield highly symmetric surface heat-flux profiles.</description>

      <title>Dual theory of decaying turbulence</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently found \cite{migdal2023exact} reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the quantum statistical theory of free fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the statistical limit $N\to \infty$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the charge density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution in quadratures, but it is too complex for an immediate computation; a separate investigation by Number Theory methods is required.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities on magnetic field amplification in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) is the low-density diffuse magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters, which reaches virial temperatures of up to 10^8 K. Under these conditions, the plasma is weakly collisional and therefore has an anisotropic pressure tensor with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. This triggers very fast, Larmor-scale, pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities that alter magnetic field amplification. We study magnetic field amplification through a turbulent small-scale dynamo, including the effects of the kinetic instabilities, during the evolution of a typical massive galaxy cluster. A specific aim of this work is to establish a redshift limit from which a dynamo has to start to amplify the magnetic field up to equipartition with the turbulent velocity field at redshift z=0. We implemented 1D radial profiles for various plasma quantities for merger trees generated with the Modified GALFORM algorithm. We assume that turbulence is driven by successive mergers of dark matter halos and construct effective models for the Reynolds number Re_eff dependence on the magnetic field in three different magnetization regimes, including the effects of kinetic instabilities. The magnetic field growth rate is calculated for the different Re_eff models. The model results in a higher magnetic field growth rate at higher redshift. For all scenarios considered, to reach equipartition at z=0, the amplification of the magnetic field has to start at redshift z_start=1.5 and above. The time to reach equipartition can be significantly shorter, in cases with systematically smaller turbulent forcing scales, and for the highest Re_eff models. Merger trees are useful tools for studying the evolution of magnetic fields in weakly collisional plasmas. They could also be used to constrain the different stages of the dynamo that could be observed by future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Multimodal Fluid Simulation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an efficient generation procedure to produce synthetic multi-modal datasets of fluid simulations. The procedure can reproduce the dynamics of fluid flows and allows for exploring and learning various properties of their complex behavior, from distinct perspectives and modalities. We employ our framework to generate a set of thoughtfully designed training datasets, which attempt to span specific fluid simulation scenarios in a meaningful way. The properties of our contributions are demonstrated by evaluating recently published algorithms for the neural fluid simulation and fluid inverse rendering tasks using our benchmark datasets. Our contribution aims to fulfill the community's need for standardized training data, fostering more reproducibile and robust research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion technology, healthcare and astrophysics.</description>
