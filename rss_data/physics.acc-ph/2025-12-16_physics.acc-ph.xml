      <title>Measurement of Position Resolutions of L-band Cavity Beam Position Monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam position monitors (BPMs) are indispensable components of modern particle accelerators, providing real-time diagnostics to ensure precise beam control, stability, and quality. As accelerators such as the International Linear Collider (ILC) aim for nanometer-scale beam sizes at the interaction point, stringent requirements on position resolution arise. Specifically, the main linac of the ILC demands a BPM resolution better than 5 {\mu}m to support stable beam transport and minimize emittance growth. To address this, we have developed an L-band cavity BPM optimized for the beam conditions of the ILC. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of an L-band cavity BPM and its signal processing system, describe the methodology for position resolution measurements, discuss the problems and solutions encountered in the past experiment, and report the projected position resolutions of about 300 nm at best.</description>

      <title>Laser Wakefield Acceleration in a Capillary Gas Cell Producing GeV-Scale High-Quality Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) is a promising approach for producing high-brightness electron beams in the GeV energy range, offering significant potential for compact next-generation accelerator facilities. In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for upcoming LWFA experiments planned within the EuPRAXIA Project at the ELI Beamlines Facility.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly overmoded and periodically loaded structures, such as the iris-line waveguide, offer an attractive solution for the efficient transportation of diffraction-prone THz pulses over long distances (hundreds of meters). This paper presents the full-scatter field theory that allows us to analytically derive all the spectral (modal) coefficients on the discontuities of the iris line. The spectral analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive surfaces. An advanced application of Lorentz's reciprocity theory, using a generalized guided-field configuration, is developed to reduce complexity of the mode-matching problem over nonuniform sections. The used technique is quite general and applies to a wide class of structures, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory agrees with and expands previously established techniques, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation. The used formulation also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
