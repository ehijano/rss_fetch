      <title>Manipulation of positional social choice correspondences under incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the manipulability of social choice correspondences in situations where individuals have incomplete information about others' preferences. We propose a general concept of manipulability that depends on the extension rule used to derive preferences over sets of alternatives from preferences over alternatives, as well as on individuals' level of information. We then focus on the manipulability of social choice correspondences when the Kelly extension rule is used, and individuals are assumed to have the capability to anticipate the outcome of the collective decision. Under these assumptions, we introduce some monotonicity properties of social choice correspondences whose combined satisfaction is sufficient for manipulability, prove a result of manipulability for unanimous positional social choice correspondences, and present a detailed analysis of the manipulability properties for the Borda, the Plurality and the Negative Plurality social choice correspondences.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Definition of Strategies in Opportunity Hunting Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose an alternative definition of strategies and histories in opportunity hunting games, as introduced in Eilat, Neeman and Solan (2025). The advantage of the formulation presented here is that it encompasses a broader class of strategies than the inertial strategies analyzed in Eilat, Neeman and Solan (2025), including those that allow for a countably infinite number of inspections within finite time intervals. Although the definitions of histories and strategies in this broader setting are more subtle, we show that the main results continue to hold. This demonstrates that the findings in Eilat, Neeman and Solan (2025) are robust to environments in which players have access to a richer strategy space.</description>

      <title>Credit, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from increases in collateral values or lower interest rate policies on long-run productivity and economic growth in a two-sector endogenous growth economy with credit frictions, with the driver of growth lying in one sector (manufacturing) but not in the other (real estate). We show that it is not so much aggregate credit expansion that matters for long-run productivity and economic growth but sectoral credit expansions. Credit expansions associated mainly with relaxation of real estate financing (capital investment financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without financial regulations, low interest rates and more expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment and economic growth are decreased. Unlike in standard macroeconomic models, in ours, the equilibrium price of land will be finite even if the safe rate of interest is less than the rate of output growth.</description>

      <title>Roommates with Convex Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roommate problems with convex preferences always have stable matchings. Efficiency and individual rationality are, moreover, compatible with strategyproofness in such convex roommate problems. Both of these results fail without the assumption of convexity. In the environment under study, preferences are convex if and only if they are single peaked. Any individually rational and convex roommate problem is homomorphic to a marriage market where an agent's gender corresponds to the direction of the agent's top-ranked partner. The existence of stable matchings then follows from the existence of stable matchings in marriage markets. To prove the second existence result, I define an efficient, individually rational, and strategyproof mechanism for convex roommate problems. To calculate outcomes, this mechanism starts with all agents being single and then gradually reassigns agents to better partners by performing minimal Pareto improvements. Whenever it becomes clear that some agent cannot be part of any further Pareto improvement, such an agent is matched.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Epidemic with Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a controlled SEIR model that advances epidemic management through optimal control theory. I improve the traditional framework by incorporating practical intervention constraints and economic considerations. Approaching this problem using modern methods of calculus of variations, I first conduct a rigorous mathematical analysis of the controlled system. Then, I formulate an infinite time horizon control problem and investigate its mathematical connections with finite time, setting the stage for applying the Hamiltonian procedure.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Distributions of Accumulated Gains and Losses in Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decades-long historic distributions of accumulated S\&amp;P500 returns, from daily returns to those over several weeks. The time series of the returns emphasize major upheavals in the markets -- Black Monday, Tech Bubble, Financial Crisis and Covid Pandemic -- which are reflected in the tail ends of the distributions. De-trending the overall gain, we concentrate on comparing distributions of gains and losses. Specifically, we compare the tails of the distributions, which are believed to exhibit power-law behavior and possibly contain outliers. Towards this end we find confidence intervals of the linear fits of the tails of the complementary cumulative distribution functions on a log-log scale, as well as conduct a statistical U-test in order to detect outliers. We also study probability density functions of the full distributions of the returns with the emphasis on their asymmetry. The key empirical observations are that the mean of de-trended distributions increases near-linearly with the number of days of accumulation while the overall skew is negative -- consistent with the heavier tails of losses -- and depends little on the number of days of accumulation. At the same time the variance of the distributions exhibits near-perfect linear dependence on the number of days of accumulation, that is it remains constant if scaled to the latter. Finally, we discuss the theoretical framework for understanding accumulated returns. Our main conclusion is that the current state of theory, which predicts symmetric or near-symmetric distributions of returns cannot explain the aggregate of empirical results.</description>

      <title>Respecting Linear Orders for Supermajority Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09419v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear orders of finite alternatives constructed by aggregating individual preferences. Specifically, we focus on linear orders that respect modified collective preference relations derived from supermajority rules, where modifications are introduced through two procedures if cycles occur. One procedure utilizes the transitive closure, while the other employs the Suzumura-consistent closure, ensuring the elimination of cycles through consistency adjustments. We derive two sets of linear orders that respect these modified collective preference relations derived from all supermajority rules, and show that these sets are generally nonempty. We show that these sets of linear orders closely relate to those obtained by the ranked pairs method and the Schulze method, thereby providing new insights into these influential methods. Finally, we show that any linear order belonging to either set satisfies two important properties: the extended Condorcet criterion and the Pareto principle.</description>

      <title>An impossibility theorem concerning positive involvement in voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05657v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In social choice theory with ordinal preferences, a voting method satisfies the axiom of positive involvement if adding to a preference profile a voter who ranks an alternative uniquely first cannot cause that alternative to go from winning to losing. In this note, we prove a new impossibility theorem concerning this axiom: there is no ordinal voting method satisfying positive involvement that also satisfies the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, resolvability, and a common invariance property for Condorcet methods, namely that the choice of winners depends only on the ordering of majority margins by size.</description>

      <title>Information Acquisition Towards Unanimous Consent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A manager facing a task of unknown difficulty can propose a plan to let a worker undertake the task; the worker can either accept the proposal or reject it. The plan benefits the worker only when the task is sufficiently easy and benefits the manager only when it is sufficiently hard. The manager can conduct a test at no cost to acquire information about the difficulty of the task; however, she can misreport the test result to the worker. We find that it is optimal for the manager to conduct a threshold test and to propose the plan only when the difficulty of the task exceeds the threshold. Moreover, when the worker privately knows his capability, we find that the manager can benefit from screening the worker by offering up to two additional interval tests.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by advection-diffusion in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies spatial patterns formed by a proximate population migration driven by real wage gradients and other idiosyncratic factors. The model consists of a tractable core-periphery model incorporating a quasi-linear log utility function and an advection-diffusion equation expressing population migration. It is found that diffusion stabilizes a homogeneous stationary solution when transport costs are sufficiently low, and it also inhibits the monotonic facilitation of agglomeration caused by lower transport costs in some cases. When the homogeneous stationary solution is unstable, numerical simulations show spatial patterns having multiple urban areas. Insights into the relation between agglomeration and control parameters (transport costs and preference for variety of consumers) gained from the large-time behavior of solutions confirm the validity of the analysis of linearized equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), a variant of the classic RPS game introduced by board game designer Yoshiteru Shinohara. Players compete against a host who always plays rock, so players choose either rock or paper. The twist is that if two or more players choose paper, they are eliminated, and the last remaining player is the winner, creating strategic tension among the players. There exists a unique symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium, in which the probability of choosing paper satisfies the equation $(1-p)^{n-1} + p^{n-1}/n = 1/n$, where $n$ is the number of remaining players. The game also admits a continuum of asymmetric equilibria.</description>

      <title>A theory of anticipated surprise for understanding risky intertemporal choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People often deviate from expected utility theory when making risky and intertemporal choices. While the effects of probabilistic risk and time delay have been extensively studied in isolation, their interplay and underlying theoretical basis are still under debate. In this work, we applied our previously proposed anticipated surprise framework to intertemporal choices with and without explicit probabilistic risk, assuming that delayed reward may fail to materialize at a fixed hazard rate. The model prediction is consistent with key empirical findings: time inconsistency and aversion to timing risk stem from the avoidance of large negative surprises, while differences in mental representations of outcome resolution explain the conflicting effects of probabilistic risk on temporal discounting. This framework is applicable to a broad range of decision-making problems and offers a new perspective over how various types of risk may interact.</description>

      <title>MAD Chairs: A new tool to evaluate AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new contribution to the problem of AI evaluation. Much as one might evaluate a machine in terms of its performance at chess, this approach involves evaluating a machine in terms of its performance at a game called "MAD Chairs." At the time of writing, evaluation with this game exposed opportunities to improve Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen and DeepSeek. Furthermore, this paper sets a stage for future innovation in game theory and AI safety by providing an example of success with non-standard approaches to each: studying a game beyond the scope of previous game theoretic tools and mitigating a serious AI safety risk in a way that requires neither determination of values nor their enforcement.</description>
