      <title>FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</description>

      <title>Sketching With Your Voice: "Non-Phonorealistic" Rendering of Sounds via Vocal Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for automatically producing human-like vocal imitations of sounds: the equivalent of "sketching," but for auditory rather than visual representation. Starting with a simulated model of the human vocal tract, we first try generating vocal imitations by tuning the model's control parameters to make the synthesized vocalization match the target sound in terms of perceptually-salient auditory features. Then, to better match human intuitions, we apply a cognitive theory of communication to take into account how human speakers reason strategically about their listeners. Finally, we show through several experiments and user studies that when we add this type of communicative reasoning to our method, it aligns with human intuitions better than matching auditory features alone does. This observation has broad implications for the study of depiction in computer graphics.</description>

      <title>Localized Gaussians as Self-Attention Weights for Point Clouds Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current data-driven methodologies for point cloud matching demand extensive training time and computational resources, presenting significant challenges for model deployment and application. In the point cloud matching task, recent advancements with an encoder-only Transformer architecture have revealed the emergence of semantically meaningful patterns in the attention heads, particularly resembling Gaussian functions centered on each point of the input shape. In this work, we further investigate this phenomenon by integrating these patterns as fixed attention weights within the attention heads of the Transformer architecture. We evaluate two variants: one utilizing predetermined variance values for the Gaussians, and another where the variance values are treated as learnable parameters. Additionally we analyze the performances on noisy data and explore a possible way to improve robustness to noise. Our findings demonstrate that fixing the attention weights not only accelerates the training process but also enhances the stability of the optimization. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study to identify the specific layers where the infused information is most impactful and to understand the reliance of the network on this information.</description>

      <title>V-Hands: Touchscreen-based Hand Tracking for Remote Whiteboard Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In whiteboard-based remote communication, the seamless integration of drawn content and hand-screen interactions is essential for an immersive user experience. Previous methods either require bulky device setups for capturing hand gestures or fail to accurately track the hand poses from capacitive images. In this paper, we present a real-time method for precise tracking 3D poses of both hands from capacitive video frames. To this end, we develop a deep neural network to identify hands and infer hand joint positions from capacitive frames, and then recover 3D hand poses from the hand-joint positions via a constrained inverse kinematic solver. Additionally, we design a device setup for capturing high-quality hand-screen interaction data and obtained a more accurate synchronized capacitive video and hand pose dataset. Our method improves the accuracy and stability of 3D hand tracking for capacitive frames while maintaining a compact device setup for remote communication. We validate our scheme design and its superior performance on 3D hand pose tracking and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in whiteboard-based remote communication. Our code, model, and dataset are available at https://V-Hands.github.io.</description>

      <title>Occupancy-Based Dual Contouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dual contouring method that provides state-of-the-art performance for occupancy functions while achieving computation times of a few seconds. Our method is learning-free and carefully designed to maximize the use of GPU parallelization. The recent surge of implicit neural representations has led to significant attention to occupancy fields, resulting in a wide range of 3D reconstruction and generation methods based on them. However, the outputs of such methods have been underestimated due to the bottleneck in converting the resulting occupancy function to a mesh. Marching Cubes tends to produce staircase-like artifacts, and most subsequent works focusing on exploiting signed distance functions as input also yield suboptimal results for occupancy functions. Based on Manifold Dual Contouring (MDC), we propose Occupancy-Based Dual Contouring (ODC), which mainly modifies the computation of grid edge points (1D points) and grid cell points (3D points) to not use any distance information. We introduce auxiliary 2D points that are used to compute local surface normals along with the 1D points, helping identify 3D points via the quadric error function. To search the 1D, 2D, and 3D points, we develop fast algorithms that are parallelizable across all grid edges, faces, and cells. Our experiments with several 3D neural generative models and a 3D mesh dataset demonstrate that our method achieves the best fidelity compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Portrait Video Editing Empowered by Multimodal Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PortraitGen, a powerful portrait video editing method that achieves consistent and expressive stylization with multimodal prompts. Traditional portrait video editing methods often struggle with 3D and temporal consistency, and typically lack in rendering quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we lift the portrait video frames to a unified dynamic 3D Gaussian field, which ensures structural and temporal coherence across frames. Furthermore, we design a novel Neural Gaussian Texture mechanism that not only enables sophisticated style editing but also achieves rendering speed over 100FPS. Our approach incorporates multimodal inputs through knowledge distilled from large-scale 2D generative models. Our system also incorporates expression similarity guidance and a face-aware portrait editing module, effectively mitigating degradation issues associated with iterative dataset updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the temporal consistency, editing efficiency, and superior rendering quality of our method. The broad applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through various applications, including text-driven editing, image-driven editing, and relighting, highlighting its great potential to advance the field of video editing.

      <title>V^3: Viewing Volumetric Videos on Mobiles via Streamable 2D Dynamic Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiencing high-fidelity volumetric video as seamlessly as 2D videos is a long-held dream. However, current dynamic 3DGS methods, despite their high rendering quality, face challenges in streaming on mobile devices due to computational and bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we introduce V\textsuperscript{3}(Viewing Volumetric Videos), a novel approach that enables high-quality mobile rendering through the streaming of dynamic Gaussians. Our key innovation is to view dynamic 3DGS as 2D videos, facilitating the use of hardware video codecs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy to reduce storage requirements with rapid training speed. The first stage employs hash encoding and shallow MLP to learn motion, then reduces the number of Gaussians through pruning to meet the streaming requirements, while the second stage fine tunes other Gaussian attributes using residual entropy loss and temporal loss to improve temporal continuity. This strategy, which disentangles motion and appearance, maintains high rendering quality with compact storage requirements. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-platform player to decode and render 2D Gaussian videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V\textsuperscript{3}, outperforming other methods by enabling high-quality rendering and streaming on common devices, which is unseen before. As the first to stream dynamic Gaussians on mobile devices, our companion player offers users an unprecedented volumetric video experience, including smooth scrolling and instant sharing.

      <title>HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Expressive and Attribute-Preserving Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current text-to-avatar methods often rely on implicit representations (e.g., NeRF, SDF, and DMTet), leading to 3D content that artists cannot easily edit and animate in graphics software. This paper introduces a novel framework for generating stylized head avatars from text guidance, which leverages locally learnable mesh deformation and 2D diffusion priors to achieve high-quality digital assets for attribute-preserving manipulation. Given a template mesh, our method represents mesh deformation with per-face Jacobians and adaptively modulates local deformation using a learnable vector field. This vector field enables anisotropic scaling while preserving the rotation of vertices, which can better express identity and geometric details. We employ landmark- and contour-based regularization terms to balance the expressiveness and plausibility of generated avatars from multiple views without relying on any specific shape prior. Our framework can generate realistic shapes and textures that can be further edited via text, while supporting seamless editing using the preserved attributes from the template mesh, such as 3DMM parameters, blendshapes, and UV coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse and expressive head avatars with high-quality meshes that artists can easily manipulate in graphics software, facilitating downstream applications such as efficient asset creation and animation with preserved attributes.</description>

      <title>Fluid Implicit Particles on Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Coadjoint Orbit FLIP (CO-FLIP), a high order accurate, structure preserving fluid simulation method in the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. We start with a Hamiltonian formulation of the incompressible Euler Equations, and then, using a local, explicit, and high order divergence free interpolation, construct a modified Hamiltonian system that governs our discrete Euler flow. The resulting discretization, when paired with a geometric time integration scheme, is energy and circulation preserving (formally the flow evolves on a coadjoint orbit) and is similar to the Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method. CO-FLIP enjoys multiple additional properties including that the pressure projection is exact in the weak sense, and the particle-to-grid transfer is an exact inverse of the grid-to-particle interpolation. The method is demonstrated numerically with outstanding stability, energy, and Casimir preservation. We show that the method produces benchmarks and turbulent visual effects even at low grid resolutions.</description>

      <title>GroomCap: High-Fidelity Prior-Free Hair Capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multi-view hair reconstruction, achieving strand-level precision remains a significant challenge due to inherent limitations in existing capture pipelines. We introduce GroomCap, a novel multi-view hair capture method that reconstructs faithful and high-fidelity hair geometry without relying on external data priors. To address the limitations of conventional reconstruction algorithms, we propose a neural implicit representation for hair volume that encodes high-resolution 3D orientation and occupancy from input views. This implicit hair volume is trained with a new volumetric 3D orientation rendering algorithm, coupled with 2D orientation distribution supervision, to effectively prevent the loss of structural information caused by undesired orientation blending. We further propose a Gaussian-based hair optimization strategy to refine the traced hair strands with a novel chained Gaussian representation, utilizing direct photometric supervision from images. Our results demonstrate that GroomCap is able to capture high-quality hair geometries that are not only more precise and detailed than existing methods but also versatile enough for a range of applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Nymeria - a large-scale, diverse, richly annotated human motion dataset collected in the wild with multiple multimodal egocentric devices. The dataset comes with a) full-body ground-truth motion; b) multiple multimodal egocentric data from Project Aria devices with videos, eye tracking, IMUs and etc; and c) a third-person perspective by an additional observer. All devices are precisely synchronized and localized in on metric 3D world. We derive hierarchical protocol to add in-context language descriptions of human motion, from fine-grain motion narration, to simplified atomic action and high-level activity summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Nymeria dataset is the world's largest collection of human motion in the wild; first of its kind to provide synchronized and localized multi-device multimodal egocentric data; and the world's largest motion-language dataset. It provides 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, total travelling distance over 399Km. The language descriptions contain 301.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset, we evaluate several SOTA algorithms for egocentric body tracking, motion synthesis, and action recognition. Data and code are open-sourced for research (c.f. https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/nymeria).</description>

      <title>A General Albedo Recovery Approach for Aerial Photogrammetric Images through Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling outdoor scenes for the synthetic 3D environment requires the recovery of reflectance/albedo information from raw images, which is an ill-posed problem due to the complicated unmodeled physics in this process (e.g., indirect lighting, volume scattering, specular reflection). The problem remains unsolved in a practical context. The recovered albedo can facilitate model relighting and shading, which can further enhance the realism of rendered models and the applications of digital twins. Typically, photogrammetric 3D models simply take the source images as texture materials, which inherently embed unwanted lighting artifacts (at the time of capture) into the texture. Therefore, these polluted textures are suboptimal for a synthetic environment to enable realistic rendering. In addition, these embedded environmental lightings further bring challenges to photo-consistencies across different images that cause image-matching uncertainties. This paper presents a general image formation model for albedo recovery from typical aerial photogrammetric images under natural illuminations and derives the inverse model to resolve the albedo information through inverse rendering intrinsic image decomposition. Our approach builds on the fact that both the sun illumination and scene geometry are estimable in aerial photogrammetry, thus they can provide direct inputs for this ill-posed problem. This physics-based approach does not require additional input other than data acquired through the typical drone-based photogrammetric collection and was shown to favorably outperform existing approaches. We also demonstrate that the recovered albedo image can in turn improve typical image processing tasks in photogrammetry such as feature and dense matching, edge, and line extraction.</description>
