      <title>Agent Network Protocol Technical White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of large models and autonomous decision-making AI, agents are rapidly becoming the new entities of the internet, following mobile apps. However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human interaction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration costs among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale agent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound transformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional software, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections, and autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these trends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication protocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains compatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable architecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid deployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol system--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation layer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems of agent identity authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery interoperability.</description>

      <title>Non-Terrestrial Network Models Using Stochastic Geometry: Planar or Spherical?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive deployment of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), the computational complexity of network performance analysis is rapidly escalating. As one of the most suitable mathematical tools for analyzing large-scale network topologies, stochastic geometry (SG) enables the representation of network performance metrics as functions of network parameters, thus offering low-complexity performance analysis solutions. However, choosing between planar and spherical models remains challenging. Planar models neglect Earth's curvature, causing deviations in high-altitude NTN analysis, yet are still often used for simplicity. This paper introduces relative error to quantify the gap between planar and spherical models, helping determine when planar modeling is sufficient. To calculate the relative error, we first propose a point process (PP) generation algorithm that simultaneously generates a pair of homogeneous and asymptotically similar planar and spherical PPs. We then introduce several typical similarity metrics, including topology-related and network-level metrics, and further develop a relative error estimation algorithm based on these metrics. In addition, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal planar altitude, which reduces computational complexity and provides theoretical support for planar approximation. Finally, numerical results investigate how deployment altitude and region affect NTN modeling, with case studies on HAP and LEO satellite constellations.</description>

      <title>AoI-Aware Resource Allocation with Deep Reinforcement Learning for HAPS-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination. The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of SAGIN from the Relay Perspective: A Spherical Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has become essential in meeting the increasing demands for global wireless communications. In SAGIN, high-altitude platforms (HAPs) can serve as communication hubs and act as relays to enhance communication performance. In this paper, we evaluate network performance and analyze the role of HAPs in SAGIN from the relay perspective. Based on this unique perspective, we introduce three metrics to evaluate the performance, named the average access data rate, the average backhaul data rate, and the backhaul rate exceedance probability (BREP). Considering the need for dynamic topology and interference analysis, we choose spherical stochastic geometry (SSG) as a tool and derive analytical expressions for the above metrics to achieve low-complexity performance evaluation. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression for the end-to-end performance metric BREP. Given that there is no existing literature in the SSG field studying networks from a relay perspective, we specifically investigate the impact of satellite network topology on performance in our numerical results to further highlight the advantages of the SSG framework. Additionally, we analyze the minimum HAP transmission power required to maintain both short-term and long-term data rate demands.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spectrum Availability Prediction using a Markov Chain Framework and ITU-R Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R (specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach, analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions, limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable AI in 6G: Detecting Concept Drift in Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-native 6G networks promise unprecedented automation and performance by embedding machine-learning models throughout the radio access and core segments of the network. However, the non-stationary nature of wireless environments due to infrastructure changes, user mobility, and emerging traffic patterns, induces concept drifts that can quickly degrade these model accuracies. Existing methods in general are very domain specific, or struggle with certain type of concept drift. In this paper, we introduce two unsupervised, model-agnostic, batch concept drift detectors. Both methods compute an expected-utility score to decide when concept drift occurred and if model retraining is warranted, without requiring ground-truth labels after deployment. We validate our framework on two real-world wireless use cases in outdoor fingerprinting for localization and for link-anomaly detection, and demonstrate that both methods are outperforming classical detectors such as ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM by 20-40 percentage points. Additionally, they achieve an F1-score of 0.94 and 1.00 in correctly triggering retraining alarm, thus reducing the false alarm rate by up to 20 percentage points compared to the best classical detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anticipation of the High Luminosity-LHC era, there is a critical need to oversee software readiness for upcoming growth in network traffic for production and user data analysis access. This paper looks into software and hardware required improvements in US-CMS Tier-2 sites to be able to sustain and meet the projected 400 Gbps bandwidth demands while tackling the challenge posed by varying latencies between sites. Specifically, our study focuses on identifying the performance of XRootD HTTP third-party copies across multiple 400 Gbps links and exploring different host and transfer configurations. Our approach involves systematic testing with variations in the number of origins per cluster and CPU allocations for each origin. By replicating real network conditions and creating network "loops" that traverse multiple switches across the wide area network, we are able to replicate authentic network conditions</description>

      <title>Quality-of-Service Aware LLM Routing for Edge Computing with Multiple Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model-Enabled Secure Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Concepts, Perspectives and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Trajectory Control and Resource Allocation in Multi-UAV-assisted MEC via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to improve the computational capacity of smart devices (SDs) in Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.</description>

Abstract: Mamba has emerged as a powerful model for efficiently addressing tasks involving temporal and spatial data. Regarding the escalating heterogeneity and dynamics in wireless networks, Mamba holds the potential to revolutionize wireless communication and networking designs by balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and effectiveness. This article presents a comprehensive overview of Mamba' applications in wireless systems. Specifically, we first analyze the potentials of Mamba for wireless signal processing tasks from the perspectives of long-range dependency modeling and spatial feature extraction. Then we propose two application frameworks for Mamba in wireless communications, i.e., replacement of traditional algorithms, and enabler of novel paradigms. Guided by the two frameworks, we conduct case studies on intelligent resource allocation and joint source and channel decoding to demonstrate Mamba's improvements in both feature enhancement and computational efficiency. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and outline potential research directions for Mamba in wireless communications and networking.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Wireless Networks for IoT with Large Vision Models: Foundations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision models (LVMs) have emerged as a foundational paradigm in visual intelligence, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual tasks. Recent advances in LVMs have facilitated their integration into Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, offering superior generalization and adaptability for vision-assisted network optimization. In this paper, we first investigate the functionalities and core architectures of LVMs, highlighting their capabilities across classification, segmentation, generation, and multimodal visual processing. We then explore a variety of LVM applications in wireless communications, covering representative tasks across the physical layer, network layer, and application layer. Furthermore, given the substantial model size of LVMs and the challenges of model retraining in wireless domains, we propose a progressive fine-tuning framework that incrementally adapts pretrained LVMs for joint optimization of multiple IoT tasks. A case study in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework over conventional CNNs in joint beamforming and positioning tasks for Internet of drones, underscoring a promising direction for integrating LVMs into intelligent wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Association and Phase Shifts Design for UAV-mounted Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different simulation setups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks</description>

      <title>Criticality-Based Dynamic Topology Optimization for Enhancing Aerial-Marine Swarm Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous marine-aerial swarm networks encounter substantial difficulties due to targeted communication disruptions and structural weaknesses in adversarial environments. This paper proposes a two-step framework to strengthen the network's resilience. Specifically, our framework combines the node prioritization based on criticality with multi-objective topology optimization. First, we design a three-layer architecture to represent structural, communication, and task dependencies of the swarm networks. Then, we introduce the SurBi-Ranking method, which utilizes graph convolutional networks, to dynamically evaluate and rank the criticality of nodes and edges in real time. Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network topology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and mission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and edges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause more significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization approach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack, reduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher mission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs, ensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase operations.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Small Satellite Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small satellites used for Earth observation generate vast amounts of high-dimensional data, but their operation in low Earth orbit creates a significant communication bottleneck due to limited contact times and harsh, varying channel conditions. While deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has emerged as a promising technique, its practical application to the complex satellite environment remains an open question. This paper presents a comprehensive DJSCC framework tailored for satellite communications. We first establish a basic system, DJSCC-SAT, and integrate a realistic, multi-state statistical channel model to guide its training and evaluation. To overcome the impracticality of using separate models for every channel condition, we then introduce an adaptable architecture, ADJSCC-SAT, which leverages attention modules to allow a single neural network to adjust to a wide range of channel states with minimal overhead. Through extensive evaluation on Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data, we demonstrate that our adaptable approach achieves performance comparable to using multiple specialized networks while significantly reducing model storage requirements. Furthermore, the adaptable model shows enhanced robustness to channel estimation errors, outperforming the non-adaptable baseline. The proposed framework is a practical and efficient step toward deploying robust, adaptive DJSCC systems for real-world satellite missions.</description>

      <title>Overlapping IPv4, IPv6, and TCP data: exploring errors, test case context and multiple overlaps inside network stacks and NIDSes with PYROLYSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IP fragmentation and TCP segmentation allow for splitting large data packets into smaller ones, e.g., for transmission across network links of limited capacity. These mechanisms permit complete or partial overlaps with different data on the overlapping portions. IPv4, IPv6, and TCP reassembly policies, i.e., the data chunk preferences that depend on the overlap types, differ across protocol implementations. This leads to vulnerabilities, as NIDSes may interpret the packet differently from the monitored host OSes. Some NIDSes, such as Suricata or Snort, can be configured so that their policies are consistent with the monitored OSes. The first contribution of the paper is PYROLYSE, an audit tool that exhaustively tests and describes the reassembly policies of various IP and TCP implementation types. This tool ensures that implementations reassemble overlapping chunk sequences without errors. The second contribution is the analysis of PYROLYSE artifacts. We first show that the reassembly policies are much more diverse than previously thought. Indeed, by testing all the overlap possibilities for n &lt;= 3 test case chunks and different testing scenarios, we observe from 14 to 20 different behaviors out of 23 tested implementations depending on the protocol. Second, we report eight errors impacting one OS, two NIDSes, and two embedded stacks, which can lead to security issues such as NIDS pattern-matching bypass or DoS attacks. A CVE was assigned to a NIDS error. Finally, we show that implemented IP and TCP policies obtained through chunk pair testing are usually inconsistent with the observed triplet reassemblies. Therefore, contrarily to what they currently do, NIDSes or other network traffic analysis tools should not apply n = 2 pair policies when the number of overlapping chunks exceeds two.</description>

      <title>Data Movement Manager (DMM) for the SENSE-Rucio Interoperation Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Data Movement Manager (DMM) is a prototype interface that connects CERN's data management software, Rucio, with the Sofware-Defined Networking (SDN) service SENSE by ESNet. It enables SDN-enabled high-energy physics data flows using the existing worldwide LHC computing grid infrastructure. A key feature of DMM is transfer priority-based bandwidth allocation, optimizing network usage. Additionally, it provides fine-grained monitoring of underperforming flows by leveraging end-to-end data flow monitoring. This is achieved through access to host-level (network interface) throughput metrics and transfer-tool (FTS) data transfer job-level metrics. This paper details the design and implementation of DMM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.</description>

      <title>World Model-Based Learning for Long-Term Age of Information Minimization in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network. Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network, which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26% improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</description>
