      <title>Robust Insurance Pricing and Liquidity Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of emerging risks, model uncertainty poses a fundamental challenge in the insurance industry, making robust pricing a first-order question. This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape competitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market. Insurers optimize their underwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value, leading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and numerically solved. Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust insurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity valuations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum, maximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that insurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative. (2) The expected length of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the range commonly reported in earlier empirical studies. (3) While the capacity process remains ergodic in the long run, the stationary density becomes more concentrated in low-capacity states, implying that liquidity-constrained insurers require longer to recover. Together, these findings provide a potential explanation for recent skepticism regarding the empirical evidence of underwriting cycles, suggesting that such cycles may indeed exist but are considerably longer than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Modeling for Enhanced Credit Risk Management in Supply Chain Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small- and medium-sized sellers, yet financing remains a critical challenge due to their limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk measures estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study explores the use of generative models in CBEC SCF risk management, illustrating their potential to strengthen credit assessment and support financing for small- and medium-sized sellers.</description>
