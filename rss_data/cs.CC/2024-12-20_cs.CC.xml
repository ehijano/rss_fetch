      <title>Folding One Polyhedral Metric Graph into Another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of folding one polyhedron, viewed as a metric graph of its edges, into the shape of another, similar to 1D origami. We find such foldings between all pairs of Platonic solids and prove corresponding lower bounds, establishing the optimal scale factor when restricted to integers. Further, we establish that our folding problem is also NP-hard, even if the source graph is a tree. It turns out that the problem is hard to approximate, as we obtain NP-hardness even for determining the existence of a scale factor 1.5-{\epsilon}. Finally, we prove that, in general, the optimal scale factor has to be rational. This insight then immediately results in NP membership. In turn, verifying whether a given scale factor is indeed the smallest possible, requires two independent calls to an NP oracle, rendering the problem DP-complete.</description>

      <title>Continuous Flattening and Reversing of Convex Polyhedral Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results about transforming any convex polyhedron, modeled as a linkage L of its edges. First, if we subdivide each edge of L in half, then L can be continuously flattened into a plane. Second, if L is equilateral and we again subdivide each edge in half, then L can be reversed, i.e., turned inside-out. A linear number of subdivisions is optimal up to constant factors, as we show (nonequilateral) examples that require a linear number of subdivisions. For nonequilateral linkages, we show that more subdivisions can be required: even a tetrahedron can require an arbitrary number of subdivisions to reverse. For nonequilateral tetrahedra, we provide an algorithm that matches this lower bound up to constant factors: logarithmic in the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Label propagation on binomial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a label propagation algorithm (LPA) on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. Initially, given a network, each vertex starts with a random label in the interval $[0,1]$. Then, in each round of LPA, every vertex switches its label to the majority label in its neighborhood (including its own label). At the first round, ties are broken towards smaller labels, while at each of the next rounds, ties are broken uniformly at random. The algorithm terminates once all labels stay the same in two consecutive iterations. LPA is successfully used in practice for detecting communities in networks (corresponding to vertex sets with the same label after termination of the algorithm). Perhaps surprisingly, LPA's performance on dense random graphs is hard to analyze, and so far convergence to consensus was known only when $np\ge n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$, where LPA converges in three rounds. By defining an alternative label attribution procedure which converges to the label propagation algorithm after three rounds, a careful multi-stage exposure of the edges allows us to break the $n^{3/4+\varepsilon}$ barrier and show that, when $np \ge n^{5/8+\varepsilon}$, a.a.s.\ the algorithm terminates with a single label. Moreover, we show that, if $np\gg n^{2/3}$, a.a.s.\ this label is the smallest one, whereas if $n^{5/8+\varepsilon}\le np\ll n^{2/3}$, the surviving label is a.a.s.\ not the smallest one. En passant, we show a presumably new monotonicity lemma for Binomial random variables that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>
