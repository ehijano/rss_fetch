      <title>scSSL-Bench: Benchmarking Self-Supervised Learning for Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably, our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis, advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating interventions for Plasmodium vivax forest malaria using a three-scale mathematical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising proportion of Plasmodium vivax cases concentrated in forest-fringe areas across the Greater Mekong Subregion highlights the importance of pharmaceutical and mosquito control techniques specifically targeted towards forest-going populations. To mathematically assess best-possible antimalarial interventions in the context of hypnozoite reactivation and seasonal forest migration, we extend a previously developed three-scale integro-differential equations model of P. vivax transmission. In particular, we fit the model to data gathered over a four-year period in Vietnam to gain insight into local P. vivax dynamics and validate the model's ability to capture epidemiological trends. The calibrated model is then used to generate optimal schedules for mass-drug administration (MDA) in forest-goers and gauge the efficacy of vector control techniques (such as long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual spraying) in forest-adjacent areas. Our results highlight the dependence of optimal MDA timing on the demographics of the human population, the importance of interventions targeting the mosquito bite rate, and the need for efficacy in hypnozoite-targeting antimalarial drugs.</description>

      <title>FAPS: A Fast Platform for Protein Structureomics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein quantification and analysis are well-accepted approaches for biomarker discovery but are limited to identification without structural information. High-throughput omics data (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) have become pervasive in cancer biology studies and reach well beyond more specialized areas such as metabolomics, epigenomics, pharmacogenomics, and interact-omics. However, large-scale analysis based on the structure of the biomolecules, namely structure-omics, is still underexplored due to a lack of handy tools. In response, we developed the Fast Analysis of Protein Structure (FAPS) database, a platform designed to advance quantitative proteomics to structure-omics analysis, which significantly shortens large-scale structure-omics from weeks to seconds. FAPS can serve as a new protein secondary structure database, providing a centralized and functional database for both simulated and experimentally determined bioinformatics statistics relating to secondary structure. Stored data is generated both through the structure simulation, currently SWISS-MODEL and AlphaFold, performed by high-performance computers, and the pre-existing UniProt database. FAPS provides user-friendly features that create a straightforward and effective way of accessing accurate data on the proportion of secondary structure in different protein chains, providing a fast numerical and visual reference for protein structure calculations and analysis. FAPS is accessible through http://fapsdb.org.</description>

      <title>Predicting function of evolutionarily implausible DNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12 state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.</description>

      <title>A Goemans-Williamson type algorithm for identifying subcohorts in clinical trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique, similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al. (2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression. Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.</description>

      <title>Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data. By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 14.69%, 22.52%, and 13.03% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.</description>

      <title>Predicting Nanoparticle Effects on Small Biomolecule Functionalities Using the Capability of Scikit-learn and PyTorch: A Case Study on Inhibitors of the DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3 (CHOP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presented study contributes to ongoing research that aims to overcome challenges in predicting the bio-applicability of nanoparticles (NPs). The approach explored a variety of combinations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data derived from the Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notations and small biomolecule features. The resulting datasets were utilised for machine learning (ML) with scikit-learn and deep neural networks (DNN) with PyTorch. Despite the obstacles in predicting how NPs influence biomolecule functionalities, the methodology was reasoned in terms of its applicability to compounds both with and without NPs. The methodology was illustrated through a quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) aimed at finding DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3 (CHOP) inhibitors. Based on this data, the optimal ML performance was obtained by the Random Forest Classifier, which was trained with 19,184 samples and tested with 4,000 achieving 81.1% accuracy, 83.4% precision, 77.7% recall, 80.4% F1-score, 81.1% ROC and 0.821 five-fold cross validation score. Complementing the main research, the paper introduces two computational applications for CHOP inhibition drug discovery. The first approach identifies the most desirable and undesirable functional groups/fragments for CHOP inhibition, with a hypothetical application to nanoformulations (NFs) as well. The second one developed a CID_SID ML model that solely relies on the PubChem identifiers to predict whether an already designed compound possesses CHOP inhibition potential (90.1 % accuracy) and thus contributes to the detection of such a side effect.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Causal Network Discovery of Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers via Scientific Literature-based Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The causal relationships between biomarkers are essential for disease diagnosis and medical treatment planning. One notable application is Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the presence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted treatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However, understanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive research. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands significant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of research papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their relation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models (LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in building causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore this, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25 years and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD biomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature of the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and scientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We find that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal networks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in identifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited. We hope this study will inspire further foundational research on AI-driven analysis of AD biomarkers causal network discovery.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Design Space of Multimodal Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.
