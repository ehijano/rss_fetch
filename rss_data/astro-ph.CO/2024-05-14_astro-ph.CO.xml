      <title>Dark Matter-Radiation Scattering Enhances CMB Phase Shift through Dark Matter-loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra is a characteristic signature for the presence of non-photon radiation propagating differently from photons, even when the radiation couples to the Standard Model particles solely gravitationally. It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\theta_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of primordial black holes crossing Solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects that could have originated from density fluctuations in a very early phase of our Universe. Recent observations restrict the masses that such PBHs could have, if they are to constitute all of dark matter today: $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \leq m \leq 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$. With such low masses, general relativity predicts that the corresponding radii for the PBHs would be atomic or subatomic in size. When captured by a star, such a tiny PBH could exhibit an orbit completely or partially inside the body of the star, without significantly changing its mass for quite a long time. Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star. As a consequence, a strong effect on the shape of the orbits emerges, leading to PBH trajectories that could be open or closed, and exhibiting a rich variety of patterns.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Lagrangian Perturbation Theory for the Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model-independent approach to lagrangian perturbation theory for the large scale structure of the universe. We focus on the displacement field for dark matter particles, and derive its most general structure without assuming a specific form for the equations of motion, but implementing a set of general requirements based on symmetry principles and consistency with the perturbative approach. We present explicit results up to sixth order, and provide an algorithmic procedure for arbitrarily higher orders. The resulting displacement field is expressed as an expansion in operators built up from the linear density field, with time-dependent coefficients that can be obtained, in a specific model, by solving ordinary differential equations. The derived structure is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, including modified gravity scenarios of the Hordenski type and models with multiple dark matter species. This work is a first step towards a complete model-independent lagrangian forward model, to be employed in cosmological analyses with power spectrum and bispectrum, other summary statistics, and field-level inference.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on mass-varying dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light mass warm dark matter is an interesting and viable alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm. An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S_8$ tension to approximately $2\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}_{-27.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Further analysis incorporating a combined data set from ACT and weak lensing results in an even more pronounced reduction in the tension to approximately $0.4\sigma$, alongside a higher detected mass of $51.2^{+16}_{-33.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We also find a better fit to the combined data compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clusters in Milgromian dynamics: Missing matter, hydrostatic bias, and the external field effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass distribution of galaxy clusters in Milgromian dynamics, or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We focus on five galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, for which high-quality data are available on both the baryonic mass distribution (gas and stars) and internal dynamics (from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect). We confirm that galaxy clusters require additional `missing matter' in MOND, although the required amount is drastically reduced with respect to the non-baryonic dark matter in the context of Newtonian dynamics. We studied the spatial distribution of the missing matter by fitting the acceleration profiles of the clusters with a Bayesian method, finding that a physical density profile with an inner core and an outer $r^{-4}$ decline (giving a finite total mass) provide good fits within $\sim$1 Mpc. At larger radii, the fit results are less satisfactory but the combination of the MOND external field effect and hydrostatic bias (quantified as 10$\%$-40$\%$) can play a key role. The missing mass must be more centrally concentrated than the intracluster medium (ICM). For relaxed clusters (A1795, A2029, A2142), the ratio of missing-to-visible mass is around $1-5$ at $R\simeq200-300$ kpc and decreases to $0.4-1.1$ at $R\simeq2-3$ Mpc, showing that the total amount of missing mass is smaller than or comparable to the ICM mass. For clusters with known merger signatures (A644 and A2319), this global ratio increases up to $\sim$5 but may indicate out-of-equilibrium dynamics rather than actual missing mass. We discuss various possibilities regarding the nature of the extra mass, in particular `missing baryons' in the form of pressure-confined cold gas clouds with masses of $&lt;10^5$ M$_\odot$ and sizes of $&lt; 50$ pc.</description>

      <title>Universal Acceleration and Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of velocity dispersions of galactic structures over a wide range of scales point to the existence of a universal acceleration scale $a_0\sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. Focusing on the fuzzy dark matter paradigm, which proposes ultralight dark matter with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV and de Broglie wavelength $\lambda\sim {\rm few}\times10^{2}$ parsecs, we highlight the emergence of the observed acceleration scale from quantum effects in a fluid-like description of the dark matter dynamics. We then suggest the possibility of a natural connection between the acceleration scale and dark energy within the same paradigm.</description>

      <title>Simons Observatory: Pre-deployment Performance of a Large Aperture Telescope Optics Tube in the 90 and 150 GHz Spectral Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory will map the temperature and polarization over half of the sky, at millimeter wavelengths in six spectral bands from the Atacama Desert in Chile. These data will provide new insights into the genesis, content, and history of our Universe; the astrophysics of galaxies and galaxy clusters; objects in our solar system; and time-varying astrophysical phenomena. This ambitious new instrument suite, initially comprising three 0.5 m small-aperture telescopes and one 6 m large aperture telescope, is designed using a common combination of new technologies and new implementations to realize an observatory significantly more capable than the previous generation. In this paper, we present the pre-deployment performance of the first mid-frequency "optics tube" which will be fielded on the large aperture telescope with sensitivity to the 90 and 150 GHz spectral bands. This optics tube contains lenses, filters, detectors, and readout components, all of which operate at cryogenic temperatures. It is one of seven that form the core of the large aperture telescope receiver in its initial deployment. We describe this optics tube, including details of comprehensive testing methods, new techniques for beam and passband characterization, and its measured performance. The performance metrics include beams, optical efficiency, passbands, and forecasts for the on-sky performance of the system. We forecast a sensitivity that exceeds the requirements of the large aperture telescope with greater than 30% margin in each spectral band, and predict that the instrument will realize diffraction-limited performance and the expected detector passbands.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity models from $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have reconstructed the extended $f(\mathcal{P})$ cubic gravity and symmetric $f(\mathcal{Q})$ teleparallel gravity from $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) and find the unknown functions $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ in terms of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ by taking the universe to be flat, homogeneous and isotropic. We then analyzed the behavior and stability of each model for the entire stages of the evolution of the universe by studying several important parameters such as the deceleration parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{DE}$, square of the speed of sound $v_s^2$. Apart from this, we have studied the cosmographic behavior by plotting the jerk parameter, snap parameter, and lerk parameter against the redshift. We have also examined the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ phase plane and $(r,s^*)$, $(r,q)$ statefinder parameters that provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the universe and the distinctive features of the dark energy. All these analyses pointed out that our model can produce a universe going through an accelerated expansion with the quintessence type dark energy.</description>

      <title>Observables of super-extremal black holes: challenging Cosmic Censorship to comprehend the Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's Field Equations have proven applicable across many scales, from black holes to cosmology. Even the mysterious Cosmological Constant found a physical interpretation in the so-called ``dark energy'' causing the accelerated cosmic expansion as inferred from multiple observables. Yet, we still lack a material source for this dark fluid. Probing the local universe to find it yields complementary information to the one from the cosmic microwave background. Could dark energy be sourced by super-extremal charged black holes? Contrary to intuition, such objects could exist with only weak observational signatures. The latter are introduced here to outline how sky surveys can identify individual candidates which challenge Cosmic Censorship on the one hand but may explain the physical origin of the Cosmological Constant on the other.</description>

      <title>Axion-Induced Patchy Screening of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons can undergo resonant conversion into axions in the presence of magnetized plasma distributed inside non-linear large-scale structure (LSS). This process leads to axion-induced patchy screening: secondary temperature and polarization anisotropies with a characteristic non-blackbody frequency dependence that are strongly correlated with the distribution of LSS along our past light cone. We compute the axion-induced patchy screening contribution to two- and three- point correlation functions that include CMB anisotropies and tracers of LSS within the halo model. We use these results to forecast the sensitivity of existing and future surveys to photon-axion couplings for axion masses between $2\times 10^{-13}$ eV and $3\times 10^{-12}$ eV, using a combination of empirical estimates from Planck data of the contribution from instrumental noise and foregrounds as well as modeled contributions on angular scales only accessible with future datasets. We demonstrate that an analysis using Planck and the unWISE galaxy catalogue would be complementary to the most sensitive existing astrophysical axion searches, probing couplings as small as $3\times 10^{-12} \, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$, while observations from a future survey such as CMB-S4 could extend this reach by almost an additional order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic and gravitational properties of AdS black shells (also referred to as AdS black bubbles) -- a class of quantum gravity motivated black hole mimickers, that in the classical limit are described as ultra compact shells of matter. We find that their electromagnetic properties are remarkably similar to black holes. We then discuss the extent to which these objects are distinguishable from black holes, both for intrinsic interest within the black shell model, and as a guide for similar efforts in other sub-classes of exotic compact objects (ECOs). We study photon rings and lensing band characteristics, relevant for very large baseline inteferometry (VLBI) observations, as well as gravitational wave observables -- quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and the static tidal Love number for non-spinning shells -- relevant for ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the single-parameter $\mathcal{R}+ c\mathcal{R}^2$ gravitational action and use constraints from astrophysics and the laboratory to derive a natural relation between the coefficient $c$ and the value of the cosmological constant. We find that the renormalisation of $c$ from the energy of the inflationary phase to the infrared, where the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe takes place, is correlated with the evolution of the vacuum energy. Our results suggest that the coefficient of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ term may provide an unexpected bridge between high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena such as inflation and dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present six nearly full-sky maps made from data taken by radiometers on the Juno satellite during its 5-year flight to Jupiter. The maps represent integrated emission over $\sim 4\%$ passbands spaced approximately in octaves between 600 MHz and 21.9 GHz. Long time-scale offset drifts are removed in all bands, and, for the two lowest frequency bands, gain drifts are also removed from the maps via a self-calibration algorithm similar to the NPIPE pipeline used by the Planck collaboration. We show that, after this solution is applied, residual noise in the maps is consistent with thermal radiometer noise. We verify our map solutions with several consistency tests and end-to-end simulations. We also estimate the level of pixelization noise and polarization leakage via simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs), whose formation and history raise many puzzles. Pulsar timing arrays have recently discovered a low-frequency cosmological "hum" of gravitational waves that may be emitted by SMBH binary systems, and the JWST and other telescopes have discovered an unexpectedly large population of high-redshift SMBHs. We argue that these two discoveries may be linked, and that they may enhance the prospects for measuring gravitational waves emitted during the mergers of massive black holes, thereby opening the way towards resolving many puzzles about SMBHs as well as providing new opportunities to probe general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review recent developments in the field of dark photons-here taken to be U(1) gauge bosons with mass less than the Z-including both kinetically mixed vectors and those that couple to anomaly-free U(1)'s. Distinctions between Higgs and Stueckelberg masses are highlighted, with discussion of swampland constraints, UV completions, and new experimental search strategies.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and their coeval gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the direct discovery of gravitational waves, black holes have regain interest in the recent years. In particular primordial black holes (PBHs), which originate from the very early Universe, may constitute (at least in part) dark matter. The possibility that dark matter is made of black holes is particularly appealing, and multi-messenger searches are important to probe this hypothesis. In this paper I will discuss the concept of primordial black holes, their origins, their characteristics and the current constraints. In addition I will explain that the study of black holes is of utmost interest since they may constitute portals to new physics and to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Mock data sets for the Eboss and DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ forest surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a publicly-available code to generate sets of mock Lyman-$\alpha$ (\lya) forest data that have realistic large-scale correlations including those due to the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The primary purpose of these mocks is to test the analysis procedures of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) surveys. The transmitted flux fraction, $F(\lambda)$, of background quasars due to \lya\ absorption in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is simulated using the Fluctuating Gunn-Petterson Approximation (FGPA) applied to Gaussian random fields produced through the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The output includes the IGM-\lya\ transmitted flux fraction along quasar lines of sight and a catalog of high-column-density systems appropriately placed at high-density regions of the IGM. This output serves as input to additional code that superimposes the IGM tranmission on realistic quasar spectra, adds absorption by high-column-density systems and metals, and simulates instrumental transmission and noise. Redshift space distortions (RSD) of the flux correlations are implemented by including the large-scale velocity-gradient field in the FGPA resulting in a correlation function of $F(\lambda)$ that can be accurately predicted. One hundred realizations have been produced over the 14,000 deg$^2$ DESI survey footprint with 100 quasars per deg$^{2}$. The analysis of these realizations shows that the correlations of $F(\lambda)$ follows the prediction within the accuracy of eBOSS survey. The most time-consuming part of the mock production occurs before application of the FGPA, and the existing pre-FGPA forests can be used to easily produce new mock sets with modified redshift-dependent bias parameters or observational conditions</description>

      <title>Numerical 1-loop correction from a potential yielding ultra-slow-roll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-field models of inflation might lead to amplified scalar fluctuations on small scales due, for example, to a transient ultra-slow-roll phase. It was argued by Kristiano $\&amp;$ Yokoyama in arXiv:2211.03395 that the enhanced amplitude of the scalar power spectrum on small scales has the potential to induce a sizeable 1-loop correction to the spectrum at large scales. In this work, we repeat the calculation for the 1-loop correction presented in arXiv:2211.03395. We closely follow their assumptions but evaluate the loop numerically. This allows us to consider both instantaneous and smooth transitions between the slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll phases. In particular, we generate models featuring realistic, smooth evolution from an analytic inflationary potential. We find that, upon fixing the amplitude of the peak in the power spectrum at short scales, the resulting 1-loop correction is not significantly reduced by considering a smooth evolution. In particular, for a power spectrum with a tree-level peak amplitude potentially relevant for small-scale phenomenology, e.g. primordial black hole production, the 1-loop correction on large scales is a few percent of the tree-level power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Measuring the reionization optical depth without large-scale CMB polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of measuring the optical depth at reionization, $\tau$, without relying on large-scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization. Our analysis is driven by the need to obtain competitive measurements that can validate the state-of-the-art constraints on this parameter, widely based on E-mode polarization measurements at $\ell\le 30$. This need is partially motivated by the typical concerns regarding anomalies observed in the Planck large-scale CMB data as well as by the remarkable fact that, excluding these latter, $\tau$ consistently exhibits correlations with anomalous parameters, such as $A_{\rm lens}$ and $\Omega_k$, suggesting that slightly higher values of the optical depth at reionization could significantly alleviate or even eliminate anomalies. Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, our most constraining result is $\tau = 0.080 \pm 0.012$, obtained by combining Planck temperature and polarization data at $\ell &gt; 30$, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck measurements of the lensing potential, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type-Ia supernova data from the Pantheon+ catalogue. Notably, using only ACT temperature, polarization, and lensing data in combination with BAO and supernovae, we obtain $\tau = 0.076 \pm 0.015$, which is entirely independent of Planck. The relative precision of these results is approaching the constraints based on large-scale CMB polarization ($\tau = 0.054 \pm 0.008$). Despite the overall agreement, we report a slight $1.8\sigma$ shift towards larger values of $\tau$. We also test how these results change by extending the cosmological model. While in many extensions they remain robust, in general obtaining precise measurements of $\tau$ may become significantly more challenging.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Recombination in the Presence of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may explain observations of magnetic fields on extragalactic scales. They are most cleanly constrained by measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropies. Their effects on cosmic recombination may even be at the heart of the resolution of the Hubble tension. We present the most detailed analysis of the effects of PMFs on cosmic recombination to date. To this end we extend the public magneto-hydrodynamic code {\sl ENZO} with a new cosmic recombination routine, Monte-Carlo simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ photon transport, and a Compton drag term in the baryon momentum equation. The resulting code allows us, for the first time, to realistically predict the impact of PMFs on the cosmic ionization history and the clumping of baryons during cosmic recombination. Our results identify the importance of mixing of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons between overdense- and underdense- regions for small PMF strength. This mixing speeds up recombination beyond the speed-up due to clumping. For non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum we find a surprising dependency of results on ultra-violet magnetic modes. The present study shall serve as a theoretical foundation for a future precise comparison of recombination with PMFs to CMB data.</description>

      <title>Forecast cosmological constraints from the number counts of Gravitational Waves events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a forecast for the upcoming Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometer with two new methods to infer cosmological parameters. We consider the emission of Gravitational Waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences, whose electromagnetic counterpart is missing, namely Dark Sirens events. Most of the methods used to infer cosmological information from GW observations rely on the availability of a redshift measurement, usually obtained with the help of external data, such as galaxy catalogues used to identify the most likely galaxy to host the emission of the observed GWs. Instead, our approach is based only on the GW survey itself and exploits the information on the distance of the GW rather than on its redshift. Since a large dataset spanning the whole distance interval is expected to fully represent the distribution, we applied our methods to the expected ET's far-reaching measuring capabilities. We simulate a dataset of observations with ET using the package $\texttt{darksirens}$, assuming an underlying $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and including the possibility to choose between three possible Star Formation Rate density (SFR) models, also accounting for possible population III stars (PopIII). We test two independent statistical methods: one based on a likelihood approach on the theoretical expectation of observed events, and another applying the $\textit{cut-and-count method}$, a simpler method to compare the observed number of events with the predicted counts. Both methods are consistent in their final results, and also show the potential to distinguish an incorrect SFR model from the data, but not the presence of a possible PopIII. Concerning the cosmological parameters, we find instead that ET observations by themselves would suffer from strong degeneracies, but have the potential to significantly contribute to parameter estimation if used in synergy with other surveys.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of early and late cosmological parameters with BAO and CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent local measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$, indicate a significant discrepancy of over 5$\sigma$ compared to the value inferred from \textit{Planck} observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this paper, we try to understand the origin of this tension by testing the consistency of early and late cosmological parameters in the same observed data. In practice, we simultaneously derive the early and late parameters using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, which provide both low and high-redshift information. To resolve parameter degeneracy, the complementary data from CMB observations are included in the analysis. By using the parameter $\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$, we introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$, defined as the ratio of $\omega_m$ which are constrained from high and low-redshift measurements respectively, to quantify the consistency between early and late parameters. We obtained a value of ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m) = 1.0069\pm0.0070$, indicating there is no tension between early parameters and late parameters in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, the Hubble tension may arise from the differences of datasets or unknown systematic errors in the current data. In addition, we forecast the future BAO measurements of ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$, using several galaxy redshift surveys and 21 cm intensity mapping surveys, and find that these measurements can significantly improve the precision of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>SIDE-real: Supernova Ia Dust Extinction with truncated marginal neural ratio estimation applied to real data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully simulation-based hierarchical analysis of the light curves of a population of low-redshift type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia). Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity enables the earliest warning and localization of gravitational waves with ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early and precise localization of gravitational waves (GWs) is pivotal in detecting their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, especially for binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). In this letter, we pioneer the exploration of utilizing the higher harmonic modes induced by the eccentricity of compact binaries to localize GWs with ground-based detectors even before the quadrupole baseline $\ell=2$ mode enters the detector band. Our theoretical analysis marks a first in proposing a strategy for gaining the earliest possible warning and maximizing preparation time for observing pre- and/or post-merger EM counterparts. We simulate three typical binaries from GWTC-3 with eccentricities ranging from 0.05 to 0.4. Our results reveal that the third-generation (3G) detectors (low frequency cut-off $f_0=5$ Hz) can accumulate sufficient signal-to-noise ratios through higher modes before the onset of the baseline $\ell=2$ mode entry into the band. Notably, relying solely on the higher modes, the 3G detector network ET+2CE achieves an average localization on the order of $1-10^2~\rm deg^2$ around 1-1.8 hours before the merger of a GW170817-like BNS, and $10-10^3~\rm deg^2$ approximately 18-30 minutes prior to the merger of a GW200115-like NSBH. A $100~\rm deg^2$ localization is attainable even 2-4 hours prior to a BNS merger. Moreover, in the near face-on orientations which are generally more favorable for EM counterpart detection, the localization can be further improved.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) contains information about the early Universe and astrophysical processes. The recent evidence of SGWB by pulsar timing arrays in the nanohertz band is a breakthrough in the GW astronomy. For ground-based GW detectors, while in data analysis, the SGWB can be masked by loud GW events from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Assuming a next-generation ground-based GW detector network, we investigate the potential for detecting the astrophysical and cosmological SGWB with non-CBC origins by subtracting recovered foreground signals of loud CBC events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) method is adopted for quick calculation. As an extension of the studies by Sachdev {\it et al.} (2020) and Zhou {\it et al.} (2023), two more essential features are considered. Firstly, we incorporate non-zero aligned or anti-aligned spin parameters in our waveform model. Because of the inclusion of spins, we obtain significantly more pessimistic results than the previous work, where the residual energy density of foreground is even larger than the original CBC foreground. For the most extreme case, we observe that the subtraction results are approximately 10 times worse for binary black hole events and 20 times worse for binary neutron star events than the scenarios without accounting for spins. The degeneracy between the spin parameters and the symmetric mass ratio is strong in the parameter estimation process, and it contributes most to the imperfect foreground subtraction. Secondly, in this work, extreme CBC events with condition numbers of FIMs $c_{\rm{\Gamma}}&gt;10^{15}$ are preserved. The impacts of these extreme events on foreground subtraction are discussed. Our results have important implications for assessing the detectability of SGWB from non-CBC origins for ground-based GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effective Action Provides Entropy of The Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09672</link>

Abstract: The effective action in renormalizable quantum theory of gravity provides entropy because the total Hamiltonian vanishes. Since it is a renormalization group invariant that is constant in the process of cosmic evolution, we can show conservation of entropy, which is an ansatz in the standard cosmology. Here, we study renormalizable quantum gravity that exhibits conformal dominance at high energy beyond the Planck scale. The current entropy of the universe is derived by calculating the effective action under the scenario of quantum gravity inflation caused by its dynamics. We then argue that ghost modes must be unphysical but are necessary for the Hamiltonian to vanish and for entropy to exist in gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Redshift Estimates with Training Sample Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15551</link>

Abstract: Large imaging surveys will rely on photometric redshifts (photo-z's), which are typically estimated through machine learning methods. Currently planned spectroscopic surveys will not be deep enough to produce a representative training sample for LSST, so we seek methods to improve the photo-z estimates that arise from non-representative training samples. Spectroscopic training samples for photo-z's are biased towards redder, brighter galaxies, which also tend to be at lower redshift than the typical galaxy observed by LSST, leading to poor photo-z estimates with outlier fractions nearly 4 times larger than for a representative training sample. In this paper, we apply the concept of training sample augmentation, where we augment simulated non-representative training samples with simulated galaxies possessing otherwise unrepresented features. When we select simulated galaxies with (g-z) color, i-band magnitude and redshift outside the range of the original training sample, we are able to reduce the outlier fraction of the photo-z estimates for simulated LSST data by nearly 50% and the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) by 56%. When compared to a fully representative training sample, augmentation can recover nearly 70% of the degradation in the outlier fraction and 80% of the degradation in NMAD. Training sample augmentation is a simple and effective way to improve training samples for photo-z's without requiring additional spectroscopic samples.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Higher-Derivative Gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an ingenious approach to explore cosmological implications of higher-derivative gravity theories. The key novelty lies in the characterization of the additional massive spin-0 modes constructed from Hubble derivatives as an effective density, with the corresponding pressure uniquely determined by energy conservation, while terms with no Hubble derivatives directly alter Friedmann equations. This classification of the various high-derivative contributions to Friedmann equations develops insight about their cosmological impacts and is essential for understanding the universe's evolution across energy scales. Various examples of higher-derivative gravity theories illustrate the power of this method in efficiently solving Friedmann equations and exploring new phenomena. Using CMB and BAO data, we apply this method to assess the observational feasibility of wall-bouncing universes, as predicted by scenarios with, e.g., certain third order modifications to general relativity. These models also provide an inflationary phase without the need to introduce extra scalar fields.</description>
