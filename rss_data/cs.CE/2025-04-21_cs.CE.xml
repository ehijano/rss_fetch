      <title>Physics-Aware Compression of Plasma Distribution Functions with GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data compression is a critical technology for large-scale plasma simulations. Storing complete particle information requires Terabyte-scale data storage, and analysis requires ad-hoc scalable post-processing tools. We propose a physics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate electron and ion velocity distribution functions with a number of Gaussian components. This GMM-based method allows us to capture plasma features such as mean velocity and temperature, and it enables us to identify heating processes and generate beams. We first construct a histogram to reduce computational overhead and apply GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within \texttt{iPIC3D}, a large-scale implicit Particle-in-Cell simulator, ensuring real-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the \texttt{ADIOS 2} library, thus optimizing the I/O process. The GPU and histogramming implementation provides a significant speed-up with respect to GMM on particles (both in time and required memory at run-time), enabling real-time compression. Compared to algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, our GMM-based method has a physics-based approach, retaining the physical interpretation of plasma phenomena such as beam formation, acceleration, and heating mechanisms. Our GMM algorithm achieves a compression ratio of up to $10^4$, requiring a processing time comparable to, or even lower than, standard compression engines.</description>

      <title>A parallel implementation of reduced-order modeling of large-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the large-scale nature of modern aerospace engineering simulations, this paper presents a detailed description of distributed Operator Inference (dOpInf), a recently developed parallel algorithm designed to efficiently construct physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for problems with large state dimensions. One such example is the simulation of rotating detonation rocket engines, where snapshot data generated by high-fidelity large-eddy simulations have many millions of degrees of freedom. dOpInf enables, via distributed computing, the efficient processing of datasets with state dimensions that are too large to process on a single computer, and the learning of structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets. All elements of dOpInf are scalable, leading to a fully parallelized reduced modeling approach that can scale to the thousands of processors available on leadership high-performance computing platforms. The resulting ROMs are computationally cheap, making them ideal for key engineering tasks such as design space exploration, risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. To illustrate the practical application of dOpInf, we provide a step-by-step tutorial using a 2D Navier-Stokes flow over a step scenario as a case study. This tutorial guides users through the implementation process, making dOpInf accessible for integration into complex aerospace engineering simulations.</description>

      <title>EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent Dialogue Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Speaker Fuzzy Fingerprints: Benchmarking Text-Based Identification in Multiparty Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker identification using voice recordings leverages unique acoustic features, but this approach fails when only textual data is available. Few approaches have attempted to tackle the problem of identifying speakers solely from text, and the existing ones have primarily relied on traditional methods. In this work, we explore the use of fuzzy fingerprints from large pre-trained models to improve text-based speaker identification. We integrate speaker-specific tokens and context-aware modeling, demonstrating that conversational context significantly boosts accuracy, reaching 70.6% on the Friends dataset and 67.7% on the Big Bang Theory dataset. Additionally, we show that fuzzy fingerprints can approximate full fine-tuning performance with fewer hidden units, offering improved interpretability. Finally, we analyze ambiguous utterances and propose a mechanism to detect speaker-agnostic lines. Our findings highlight key challenges and provide insights for future improvements in text-based speaker identification.</description>

      <title>Industrial Metaverse: Enabling Technologies, Open Problems, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an emerging technology that enables seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds, the Metaverse has great potential to be deployed in the industrial production field with the development of extended reality (XR) and next-generation communication networks. This deployment, called the Industrial Metaverse, is used for product design, production operations, industrial quality inspection, and product testing. However, there lacks of in-depth understanding of the enabling technologies associated with the Industrial Metaverse. This encompasses both the precise industrial scenarios targeted by each technology and the potential migration of technologies developed in other domains to the industrial sector. Driven by this issue, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on the Industrial Metaverse. Specifically, we first analyze the advantages of the Metaverse for industrial production. Then, we review a collection of key enabling technologies of the Industrial Metaverse, including blockchain (BC), digital twin (DT), 6G, XR, and artificial intelligence (AI), and analyze how these technologies can support different aspects of industrial production. Subsequently, we present numerous formidable challenges encountered within the Industrial Metaverse, including confidentiality and security concerns, resource limitations, and interoperability constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the extant solutions devised to address them. Finally, we briefly outline several open issues and future research directions of the Industrial Metaverse.</description>

      <title>An optimization-based coupling of reduced order models with efficient reduced adjoint basis generation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization-based coupling (OBC) is an attractive alternative to traditional Lagrange multiplier approaches in multiple modeling and simulation contexts. However, application of OBC to time-dependent problems has been hindered by the computational cost of finding the stationary points of the associated Lagrangian, which requires primal and adjoint solves. This issue can be mitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced order models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this paper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission problem. We pursue the ``optimize-then-reduce'' path towards solving the minimization problem at each timestep and solve reduced-space adjoint system of equations, where the main challenge in this formulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the adjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the paper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the approach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a reduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot energy, average iteration counts, and timings.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading relies on extracting meaningful signals from diverse financial data sources, including candlestick charts, order statistics on put and canceled orders, traded volume data, limit order books, and news flow. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in processing unstructured data and has significantly advanced natural language processing, its application to structured financial data remains an ongoing challenge. This study investigates the integration of deep learning models with financial data modalities, aiming to enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization. We present a novel approach to incorporating limit order book analysis into algorithmic trading by developing embedding techniques and treating sequential limit order book snapshots as distinct input channels in an image-based representation. Our methodology for processing limit order book data achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-frequency trading algorithms, underscoring the effectiveness of deep learning in financial applications.</description>
