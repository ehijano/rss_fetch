      <title>Deformations of OP ensembles in a bulk critical scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orthogonal polynomial ensembles whose weights are deformations of exponential weights, in the limit of a large number of particles. The deformation symbols we consider affect local fluctuations of the ensemble around a bulk point of the limiting spectrum. We identify the limiting kernel in terms of a solution to an integrable non-local differential equation. This novel kernel is the correlation kernel of a conditional thinned process starting from the Sine point process, and it is also related to a finite temperature deformation of the Sine kernel as recently studied by Claeys and Tarricone. We also unravel the effect of the deformation on the recurrence coefficients of the associated orthogonal polynomials, which display oscillatory behavior even in a one-cut regular situation for the limiting spectrum.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory II: Quantum invariants of higher ribbons in $D^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the first paper (arXiv:2501.06486) of this series, where the framework for the combinatorial quantization of the 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory with an underlying compact structure Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$ was laid out. In this paper, we continue our quest and characterize additive module *-functors $\omega:\mathfrak{C}_q(\mathbb{G}^{\Gamma^2})\rightarrow\mathsf{Hilb}$, which serve as a categorification of linear *-functionals (ie. a state) on a $C^*$-algebra. These allow us to construct non-Abelian Wilson surface correlations $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_q(\mathbb{G}^{P})$ on the discrete 2d simple polyhedra $P$ partitioning 3-manifolds. By proving its stable equivalence under 3d handlebody moves, these Wilson surface states extend to decorated 3-dimensional marked bordisms in a 4-disc $D^4$. This provides invariants of framed oriented 2-ribbonsin $D^4$ from the data of the given compact Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$. We find that these 2-Chern-Simons-type 2-ribbon invariants are given by bigraded $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, similar to the lasagna skein modules of Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry of Spencer-Hodge Decompositions in Constrained Geometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the interaction mechanism between metric structures and mirror transformations in Spencer complexes of compatible pairs. Our core contribution is the establishment of mirror symmetry for Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, solving the key technical problem of analyzing the behavior of metric geometry under sign transformations. Through precise operator difference analysis, we prove that the perturbation $\mathcal{R}^k = -2(-1)^k \omega \otimes \delta^{\lambda}_{\mathfrak{g}}(s)$ induced by the mirror transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$ is a bounded compact operator, and apply Fredholm theory to establish the mirror invariance of harmonic space dimensions $\dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,\lambda} = \dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,-\lambda}$. We further prove the complete invariance of constraint strength metrics and curvature geometric metrics under mirror transformations, thus ensuring the spectral structure stability of Spencer-Hodge Laplacians. From a physical geometric perspective, our results reveal that sign transformations of constraint forces do not affect the essential topological structure of constraint systems, embodying deep symmetry principles in constraint geometry. This work connects Spencer metric theory with mirror symmetry theory, laying the foundation for further development of constraint geometric analysis and computational methods.</description>

      <title>A Covariant Framework for Generalized Spinor Dual Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for defining the dual structure of a spinor. This construction relies on the basis elements of the Clifford algebra, leading to a covariant structure that embeds the dual. The formulation includes free parameters that may be adjusted to meet specific requirements. Remarkably, it enables the explicit construction of representatives for each class within a recently proposed general classification of spinors. In addition to recovering known results, the formalism paves the way for the development of potential new theories in a manifestly covariant setting.</description>

      <title>Dimerization in $O(n)$-invariant quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish dimerization in $O(n)$-invariant quantum spin chains with big enough $n$, in a large part of the phase diagram where this result is expected. This includes identifying two distinct ground states which are translations of one unit of eachother, and which both have exponentially decaying correlations. Our method relies on a probabilistic representation of the quantum system in terms of random loops, and an adaptation of a method developed for loop $O(n)$ models on the hexagonal lattice by Duminil-Copin, Peled, Samotij and Spinka.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of the $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field-theoretic tool that enable us to evaluate the critical exponents of $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory. It generalizes the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs through the introduction of the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter from which Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered in the limit $\delta_{KLS}\rightarrow 0$. From the results for the critical exponents we provide the referred physical interpretation for the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter. Although new generalized universality classes emerge, we show that they are incomplete for describing the behavior of some real materials. This task is fulfilled only for nonextensive statistical field theory, which is related to fractal derivative and multifractal geometries, up to the moment, for our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Elliptic asymptotic behaviour of $q$-Painlev\'e transcendents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Painlev\'e equations have mathematical properties closely related to those of the differential Painlev\'e equations. We investigate the appearance of elliptic functions as limiting behaviours of $q$-Painlev\'e transcendents, analogous to the asymptotic theory of classical Painlev\'e transcendents. We focus on the $q$-difference second Painlev\'e equation in the asymptotic regime $|q-1|\ll1$, showing that generic leading-order behaviour is given in terms of elliptic functions and that the slow modulation in this behaviour is approximated in terms of complete elliptic integrals.</description>

      <title>On generating direct powers of dynamical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expressibility and trainability of parameterized quantum circuits has been shown to be intimately related to their associated dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs). From a quantum algorithm design perspective, given a set $A$ of DLA generators, two natural questions arise: (i) what is the DLA $\mathfrak{g}_{A}$ generated by ${A}$; and (ii) how does modifying the generator set lead to changes in the resulting DLA. While the first question has been the subject of significant attention, much less has been done regarding the second. In this work we focus on the second question, and show how modifying ${A}$ can result in a generator set ${A}'$ such that $\mathfrak{g}_{{A}'}\cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^{K}\mathfrak{g}_{A}$, for some $K \ge 1$. In other words, one generates the direct sum of $K$ copies of the original DLA.
  In particular, we give qubit- and parameter-efficient ways of achieving this, using only $\log K$ additional qubits, and only a constant factor increase in the number of DLA generators. For cyclic DLAs, which include Pauli DLAs and QAOA-MaxCut DLAs as special cases, this can be done with $\log K $ additional qubits and the same number of DLA generators as ${A}$.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation from periodic solutions of central force problems in the three-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with electromagnetic perturbations of a central force problem of the form \begin{equation*} \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \bigl( \varphi(\dot{x}) \bigr) = V'(|x|) \dfrac{x}{|x|} + E_{\varepsilon}(t,x)+\dot{x} \wedge B_{\varepsilon}(t,x), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\}, \end{equation*} where $V \colon (0,+\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function, $E_\varepsilon$ and $B_\varepsilon$ are respectively the electric field and the magnetic field, smooth and periodic in time, $\varepsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ is a small parameter. The considered differential operator includes, as special cases, the classical one, $\varphi(v)=mv$, as well as that of special relativity, $\varphi(v) = mv/\sqrt{1-\vert v \vert^2/c^2}$. We investigate whether non-circular periodic solutions of the unperturbed problem (i.e., with $\varepsilon=0$) can be continued into periodic solutions for $\varepsilon\neq0$ small, both for the fixed-period problem and, if the perturbation is time-independent, for the fixed-energy problem. The proof is based on an abstract bifurcation theorem of variational nature, which is applied to suitable Hamiltonian action functionals. In checking the required non-degeneracy conditions we take advantage of the existence of partial action-angle coordinates as provided by the Mishchenko--Fomenko theorem for superintegrable systems. Physically relevant problems to which our results can be applied are homogeneous central force problems in classical mechanics and the Kepler problem in special relativity.</description>

      <title>Path operators and $(q,t)$-tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new class of operators that act on symmetric functions with two deformation parameters $q$ and $t$. Our combinatorial construction associates each operator with a specific lattice path, whose steps alternate between moving up and down. We demonstrate that positive linear combinations of these operators are the images of Negut elements via a representation of the shuffle algebra acting on the space of symmetric functions. Additionally, we provide a monomial, elementary, and Schur symmetric function expansion for the symmetric function obtained through repeated applications of the path operators on $1$.
  We apply path operators to investigate a $(q,t)$-deformation of the classical hypergeometric tau functions, which generalizes several important series already present in enumerative geometry, gauge theory, and integrability. We prove that this function is uniquely characterized by a family of partial differential equations derived from a positive linear combination of path operators. We also use our operators to offer a new, independent proof of the key result in establishing the extended delta conjecture of Haglund, Remmel, and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of cluster maps of type $D_{2N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend one of the main results in \cite{hkm24}, of a deformed type $D_{4}$ map, to the general case of the type $D_{2N}$ for $N\geq3$. This can be achieved through a "local expansion" operation, introduced in the joint work \cite{grab} with Grabowski and Hone. This operation involves inserting a specific subquiver into the quiver arising from the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{4}$ map. This insertion yields a new quiver, obtained through the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{6}$ map and thus enables systematic generalization to higher ranks $D_{2N}$. We further considered the degree growth of the deformed type $D_{2N}$ map via the tropical method and conjecture that for each $N$, the deformed map is an integrable map by applying an algebraic entropy test, the criterion for detecting integrability of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of percolation when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <title>Can Theoretical Physics Research Benefit from Language Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains, yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics -- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data, propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vogel's universality gives a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. It is associated with representation theory within the framework of Chern-Simons theory only, and gives rise to universal knot invariants. We extend the list of these latter further, and explain how to deal with the adjoint invariants for the torus knots $T[m,n]$ considering the case of $T[4,n]$ with odd $n$ in detail.</description>

Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Schr\"odinger operators with point interactions on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, with homogeneous Robin or Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$ and a point (zero-range) interaction placed at an interior point of $\Omega$. We show that, under suitable spectral assumptions, and by means of an extension-restriction procedure which exploit the already known result on the entire space, the singular interaction is approximated by rescaled sequences of regular potentials. The result is missing in the literature, and we also take the opportunity to point out some general issues in the approximation of point interactions and the role of zero energy resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a method to obtain the renormalised measure in quantum field theory directly from the renormalisation of the expansion of the original measure. Our approach is based on BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely successful for describing scalar-valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart to the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer for the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. This new Hopf algebra also bridges the gap between the analysis of "pre-Feynman diagrams" and traditional diagrammatic methods. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our method by the $ \Phi^4 $ measure example.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials and truncated unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials $p_{n}(z)$ of degree $n$, defined with respect to the planar measure \begin{equation*} d\mu(z) = (1-|z|^{2})^{\alpha-1}|z-x|^{\gamma}\mathbf{1}_{|z| &lt; 1}d^{2}z, \end{equation*} where $d^{2}z$ is the two dimensional area measure, $\alpha$ is a parameter that can grow with $n$, while $\gamma&gt;-2$ and $x&gt;0$ are fixed. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. We obtain asymptotics in all regions of the complex plane and via an appropriate differential identity, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the partition function. The main approach is to convert the planar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane. Then the asymptotic analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

Abstract: In this short communication we discuss the ultraviolet renormalization of the van Hove-Miyatake scalar field, generated by any distributional source. An abstract algebraic approach, based on the study of a special class of ground states of the van Hove-Miyatake dynamical map is compared with an Hamiltonian renormalization that makes use of a non-unitary dressing transformation. The two approaches are proved to yield equivalent results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present broadly applicable tools for determining the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors under the addition of self-adjoint operators and under the multiplication of unitaries, in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The new tools provide explicit non-perturbative expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. To illustrate the broad applicability of the new tools, we outline several applications, for example, to Shannon sampling in information theory. A longer companion paper applies the new tools to adiabatic quantum evolution, thereby shedding new light on the connection between an adiabatic quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement and the quantum computation's speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in understanding charge transport at atomic scales. The motivations are myriad, including understanding the conductance properties of peptides measured experimentally. In this study, we propose a model of quantum statistical mechanics which aims to investigate the transport properties of 1D-semiconductor at nanoscales. The model is a two-band Hamiltonian in which electrons are assumed to be quasi-free. It allows us to investigate the behaviour of current and quantum fluctuations under the influence of numerous parameters, showing the response with respect to varying voltage, temperature and length. We compute the current observable at each site and demonstrate the local behaviour generating the current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a string-net construction of a modular functor whose algebraic input is a pivotal bicategory; this extends the standard construction based on a spherical fusion category. An essential ingredient in our construction is a graphical calculus for pivotal bicategories, which we express in terms of a category of colored corollas. The globalization of this calculus to oriented surfaces yields the bicategorical string-net spaces as colimits. We show that every rigid separable Frobenius functor between strictly pivotal bicategories induces linear maps between the corresponding bicategorical string-net spaces that are compatible with the mapping class group actions and with sewing. Our results are inspired by and have applications to the description of correlators in two-dimensional conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>On the long-time behaviour of reversible interacting particle systems in one and two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By refining Holley's free energy technique, we show that, under quite general assumptions on the dynamics, the attractor of a (possibly non-translation-invariant) interacting particle system in one or two spatial dimensions is contained in the set of Gibbs measures if the dynamics admits a reversible Gibbs measure. In particular, this implies that there can be no reversible interacting particle system that exhibits time-periodic behaviour and that every reversible interacting particle system is ergodic if and only if the reversible Gibbs measure is unique. In the special case of non-attractive stochastic Ising models this answers a question due to Liggett.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14315v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of large structured random matrices characterized by four fundamental properties which we discuss. We prove that this class is stable under matrix-valued and pointwise non-linear operations. We then formulate an efficient method, based on an extremization problem, for computing the spectrum of subblocks of such large structured random matrices. We present different proofs -- combinatorial or algebraic -- of the validity of this method, which all have some connection with free probability. We illustrate this method with well known examples of unstructured matrices, including Haar randomly rotated matrices, as well as with the example of structured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process. tured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations and pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Painlev\'e equations constitute a famous class of integrable non-autonomous second order difference equations. A classification scheme proposed by Sakai interprets a discrete Painlev\'e equation as a birational map between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). We propose a novel geometric interpretation of discrete Painlev\'e equations, where the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as an autonomous birational transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one, according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1980's H Verlinde suggested to construct and use a quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces to construct spaces of conformal blocks for the Liouville conformal field theory. This suggestion led to a mathematical formulation by Fock in 1990's and later by Fock, Goncharov and Shen, called the modular functor conjecture, based on the Chekhov-Fock quantum Teichm\"uller theory. In 2000's Teschner combined the Chekhov-Fock version and the Kashaev version of quantum Teichm\"uller theory to construct a solution to a modified form of the conjecture. We embark on a direct approach to the conjecture based on the Chekhov-Fock(-Goncharov) theory. We construct quantized trace-of-monodromy along simple loops via Bonahon and Wong's quantum trace maps developed in 2010's, and investigate algebraic structures of them, which will eventually lead to construction and properties of quantized geodesic length operators. We show that a special recursion relation used by Teschner is satisfied by the quantized trace-of-monodromy, and that the quantized trace-of-monodromy for disjoint loops commute in a certain strong sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the causal (forward/backward) propagators for the massive Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by a first order operator which decays in space but not necessarily in time. In particular, we obtain global estimates for forward/backward solutions to the inhomogeneous, perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, including in the presence of bound states of the limiting spatial Hamiltonians.
  To this end, we prove propagation of singularities estimates in all regions of infinity (spatial, null, and causal) and use the estimates to prove that the Klein-Gordon operator is an invertible mapping between adapted weighted Sobolev spaces. This builds off work of Vasy in which inverses of hyperbolic PDEs are obtained via construction of a Fredholm mapping problem using radial points propagation estimates. To deal with the presence of a perturbation which persists in time, we employ a class of pseudodifferential operators first explored in Vasy's many-body work.</description>

      <title>The Dirac operator for the pair of Ruelle and Koopman operators, and a generalized Boson formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathbf{\mu}$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift map $\sigma$ acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by $L$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $K = L^{\dagger}$ the Koopman operator, both acting on $\mathscr{L}^2(\mathbf{\mu})$. The Ruelle-Koopman pair can determine a generalized boson system in the sense of \cite{Kuo}. Here $2^{-\frac{1}{2}} K$ plays the role of the creation operator and $ 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} L$ is the annihilation operator. We show that $[L,K]$ is the projection on the kernel of $L.$ In $C^*$-algebras the Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ represents derivative. Akin to this point of view we introduce a dynamically defined Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ associated with the Ruelle-Koopman pair and a representation $\pi$. Given a continuous function $f$, denote by $M_f$ the operator $ g \to M_f(g)=f\, g.$ Among other dynamical relations we get $$\|\left[ \mathcal{D} , \pi (M_f) \right]\| = \sup_{x \in \Omega} \sqrt{\frac{|f(x) - f(0x)|^{2}}{2} + \frac{|f(x) - f(1x)|^2}{2}} = \left|\sqrt{L |K f - f|^{2}}\right|_{\infty}$$ which concerns a form of discrete-time mean backward derivative. We also derive an inequality for the discrete-time forward derivative $f \circ \sigma -f$: $$ |f \circ \sigma -f |_{\infty} = |K f - f|_{\infty} \geq \|\left[ \mathcal{D} , \pi (M_f) \right]\| \geq |f - L f|_{\infty}.$$ Moreover, we get $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(K L)\right] \,\|=1$. The Number operator is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}K \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} L.$ The Connes distance requires to ask when an operator $A$ satisfies the inequality $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(A)\right] \,\|\leq 1$; the Lipschtiz constant of $A$ smaller than $1$.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. The entropyp roduction maximizing solutions are selected.
  Part I of this paper defines the entropy principle and using it, finds improved regularity for the Navier-Stokes solutions.
  Part II concerns initial data and its achievability as a limit of the small time data.
  Part III establishes analyticity properties of the Part II solution; Part IV demonstrates blowup in finite time.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andersson and Chru\'sciel showed that generic asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets admit polyhomogeneous expansions, and that only a non-generic subclass of solutions of the conformal constraint equations is free of logarithmic singularities. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, within the evolutionary framework of the constraint equations, we show that the existence of a well-defined Bondi mass brings the asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets into a subclass whose Cauchy development guaranteed to admit a smooth boundary, by virtue of the results of Andersson and Chru\'sciel. Second, by generalizing a recent result of Beyer and Ritchie, we show that the existence of well-defined Bondi mass and angular momentum, together with some mild restrictions on the free data, implies that the generic solutions of the parabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraint equations are completely free of logarithmic singularities. We also provide numerical evidence to show that in the vicinity of Kerr, asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities can indeed be constructed.</description>
