      <title>Thermal wakefield structure in plasma acceleration processes: insights from fluid models and PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the process of plasma acceleration in the presence of non-negligible thermal effects, wherein a driver of relativistic electrons perturbs a warm neutral plasma and generates a wakefield structure. We study the acceleration process via numerical simulations based on fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions, and also provide systematic comparisons against ground-truth data coming from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The focus of the analysis is on the first electron depletion bubble after the driver, where we provide a detailed characterization of its size and the electromagnetic fields developed inside. Our results are instrumental in determining the correct thermal closure assumption to be used in fluid models for the numerical simulations of plasma acceleration processes, as well as elucidating the corresponding limits of applicability.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Simulations of EMI-BF4 Neutral-Surface Interactions in Electrospray Thrusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrospray thrusters promise compact, high specific impulse propulsion for small spacecraft, yet ground characterization remains confounded by secondary species emission and incomplete diagnostics of neutral products. To address these limitations, we perform energy-resolved mixed quantum/classical (QM/MM) ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) of neutral 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, EMI-BF4, colliding with Au extractor surfaces with impact energies from 10 to 100 eV to resolve fragment species spectra, charge states, kinetic energy partitioning, and scattering geometry. The simulations reveal a three-stage sequence with impact energy: the low energy regime, 10 to 20 eV, which favors ionic dissociation, intermediate energy regime, between 30 to 40 eV, opens a neutralization window, and high energy regime, greater than 50 eV, drives covalent fragmentation into many light products with mixed charge states. Fractional energy distributions show a transition from few-body, energy-concentrated outcomes in the low energy regime to many-body, energy-dispersed outcomes in the high energy regime. Deflection angle distributions exhibit a strong mass-to-angle anti-correlation such that heavier fragments favor small deflection, whereas lighter fragments populate larger deflection angles. The fraction of transient metastables peaks near 50 eV, coinciding with abundant neutral fragment production. Importantly, neutral bombardment still produces charged secondaries at the target even when the upstream ion plume is fully suppressed by a decelerating electrode. These findings provide a basis for de-biasing facility measurements by pairing tandem time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and residual gas analyzer with suppression-bias corrections to inform the design of electrospray thrusters that reduce interception and contamination on extractor surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical-Time Framework for the Dynamics of Charged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of the time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two study cases: an uniform electromagnetic field and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <title>Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 {\mu}m), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 {\mu}m). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.</description>
