      <title>Stability of Hypergraph Invariants and Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are fundamental tools for modeling pairwise interactions in complex systems. However, many real-world systems involve multi-way interactions that cannot be fully captured by standard graphs. Hypergraphs, which generalize graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of vertices, offer a more expressive framework. In this paper, we introduce a new metric on the space of hypergraphs, inspired by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for metric spaces. We establish Lipschitz properties of common hypergraph transformations, which send hypergraphs to graphs, including a novel graphification method with ties to single linkage hierarchical clustering. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for the hypergraph distance via invariants coming from basic summary statistics and from topological data analysis techniques. Finally, we explore stability properties of cost functions in the context of optimal transport. Our results in this direction consider Lipschitzness of the Hausdorff map and conservation of the non-negative cross curvature property under limits of cost functions.</description>

      <title>The betweenness relation distinguishes non-similar pairs of concentric circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two subsets $A, B$ of the plane are betweenness isomorphic if there is a bijection $f\colon A\to B$ such that, for every $x,y,z\in A$, the point $f(z)$ lies on the line segment connecting $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ if and only if $z$ lies on the line segment connecting $x$ and $y$. In general, it is quite difficult to tell whether two given subsets of the plane are betweenness isomorphic. We concentrate on the case when the sets $A,B$ belong to the family $ \mathcal A_c$ of unions of pairs of concentric circles in the plane. We prove that $A, B \in \mathcal A_c$ are betweenness isomorphic if and only if they are similar. In particular, there are continuum many betweenness isomorphism classes in $ \mathcal A_c$, and each of these classes consists exactly of all scaled translations of an arbitrary representative of the class. Furthermore, we show that every betweenness isomorphism between sets $A,B\in \mathcal A_c$ is exactly the restriction of a scaled isometry of the plane.</description>

      <title>An illustrated introduction to the arithmetic of Apollonian circle packings, continued fractions, and other thin orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes cover and expand upon the material for two summer schools: The first, which was held at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 10-14, 2023, as part of "Renormalization and Visualization for packing, billiard and surfaces", was titled "Number theory as a door to geometry, dynamics and illustration". The second was held at NSU IMS in Singapore, June 3-7, 2024, as part of "Computational Aspects of Thin Groups", and was titled "Integral packings and number theory". Both courses were put together by a number theorist for students and researchers in other fields. They cover a web of ideas relating to Apollonian circle packings, integral orbits, thin groups, hyperbolic geometry, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. The connection of geometry and dynamics to number theory gives an opportunity to illustrate arithmetic by appealing to our visual intuition.</description>

      <title>Self-embedding similitudes of Bedford-McMullen carpets with dependent ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allow oblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending the carpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallel to one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurability result on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previous study of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. &amp; Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] on Bedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents, together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.
  For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinski carpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and hence allows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that if a generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition and permits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent of the rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic sets of three types of convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sets of three types of convex pentagons that are aperiodic with no matching conditions on the edges are created from a chiral aperiodic monotile Tile(1, 1). This method divides the interior of Tile(1,1) into five convex polygons with five or more edges, and we have so far identified four methods.</description>

      <title>Rational Gluing in Edge Replacement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the rationality of the gluing relation of edge replacement systems, which were introduced for studying rearrangement groups of fractals. More precisely, we describe an algorithmic procedure for building a finite state automaton that recognizes pairs of equivalent sequences that are glued in the fractal. This fits in recent interest towards the rationality of gluing relations on totally disconnected compact metrizable spaces.</description>
