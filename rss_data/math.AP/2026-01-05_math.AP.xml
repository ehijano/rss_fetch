      <title>Stability of time-periodic solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and stability of a time-periodic solution to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the three-dimensional whole space when a time-periodic external force is sufficiently small. The time decay estimate of the perturbation around the time-periodic solution is derived under the assumption that an initial perturbation is small and belongs to $L^p$ for some $1\leq p\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Existence and (in)stability of standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations on looping-edge graphs with $\delta'$-type interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and orbital (in)stability of several branches of standing--wave solutions for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on a looping--edge graph $\mathcal{G}$, consisting of a circle and a finite number $N$ of infinite half--lines attached to a common vertex. The model is endowed with $\delta'$--type interaction boundary conditions at the vertex, which enforce continuity of the derivatives of the wave functions, while continuity of the wave function itself is not required. By means of the Implicit Function Theorem, we establish the existence of families of standing--wave profiles that converge, on the circular component of the graph, to Jacobi elliptic solutions of dnoidal type, coupled with soliton--type tail profiles on the half--lines. Tools from perturbation theory and Kre\u{\i}n--von Neumann extension theory for symmetric operators play a central role in the (in)stability analysis of such standing wave solutions. Our approach may be extended to other bound states for the NLS on looping graphs or more general non--compact metric graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a Harnack inequality for non-negative solutions of the normalized infinity Laplacian with nonlinear absorption and gradient terms. More specifically, we establish a Harnack inequality for non-negative viscosity solutions of the PDE $\Delta_\infty^Nu=f(u)+g(u)|Du|^q$, where $0\le q\le 1$, and for a large class of non-decreasing continuous functions $f$ and $g$ that meet suitable growth conditions at infinity.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the maximal solution of the supercooled Stefan problem in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness of the maximal weak solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem in 1 dimension. This follows by showing that in 1 dimension, the optimal solution of the corresponding free target optimal transport problem given in \cite{GeneralDimensions}, is independent of the choice of the cost function. Moreover, we show that the supercooled Stefan problem lacks monotonicity and $L^1$-Lipschitz stability, which are available in a similar problem considered in a previous paper \cite{freetarget}. However, in $1$ dimension, it has stability in the weak convergence of measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp nonuniqueness result for the forced generalized SQG equation. First, this yields nonunique $\dot{H}^s$- energy solutions below the Miura-Ju class. In particular, this shows that the solutions constructed by Resnick and Marchand for the dissipative SQG equation are not necessarily unique. Second, this establishes nonuniqueness below the Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin class for the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, as well as below the Constantin-Wu and Dong-Chen-Zhao-Liu classes for the dissipative SQG equation.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Enhanced Fourier Method for the Multi-Frequency Inverse Source Problem with Sparse Far-Field Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid computational framework for the multi-frequency inverse source problem governed by the Helmholtz equation. By integrating a classical Fourier method with a deep convolutional neural network, we address the challenges inherent in sparse and noisy far-field data. The Fourier method provides a physics-informed, low-frequency approximation of the source, which serves as the input to a U-Net. The network is trained to map this coarse approximation to a high-fidelity source reconstruction, effectively suppressing truncation artifacts and recovering fine-scale geometric details. To enhance computational efficiency and robustness, we propose a high-to-low noise transfer learning strategy: a model pre-trained on high-noise regimes captures global topological features, offering a robust initialization for fine-tuning on lower-noise data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions with noise levels up to 100%, significantly outperforms traditional spectral methods under sparse measurement constraints, and generalizes well to unseen source geometries.</description>

      <title>Limiting Behavior of Non-Autonomous Stochastic Reversible Selkov Lattice Systems Driven by Locally Lipschitz L\'{e}vy Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-term distributional behavior of the reversible Selkov lattice systems defined on the set $\mathbb{Z}$ and driven by locally Lipschitz \emph{L\'{e}vy noises}, which possess two pairs of oppositely signed nonlinear terms and whose nonlinear couplings can grow polynomially with any order $p \geq 1$. Firstly, based on the global-in-time well-posedness in $L^{2}(\Omega, \ell^2 \times \ell^2)$, we define a \emph{continuous} non-autonomous dynamical system (NDS) on the metric space $(\mathcal{P}_{2}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2), d_{\mathcal{P}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2)})$, where $d_{\mathcal{P}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2)}$ is the dual-Lipschitz distance on $\mathcal{P}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2)$, the space of probability measures on $\ell^2 \times \ell^2$. Specifically, we establish that this non-autonomous dynamical system admits a unique pullback measure attractor, characterized via measure-valued complete solutions and orbits in the sense of Wang (DOI.org/10.1016/j.jde.2012.05.015). Moreover, when the deterministic external forcing terms are periodic in time, we demonstrate that the pullback measure attractors are also periodic. We also study the upper semicontinuity of pullback measure attractors as $(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \gamma_1, \gamma_2) \rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The main difficulty in proving the pullback asymptotic compactness of the NDS in $(\mathcal{P}_{2}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2), d_{\mathcal{P}(\ell^2 \times \ell^2)})$ is caused by the lack of compactness in infinite-dimensional lattice systems, which is overcome by using uniform tail-ends estimates. And the inherent structure of the Selkov system precludes the possibility of any unidirectional dissipative influence arising from the interaction between the two coupled equations, thereby obstructing the emergence of a dominant energy-dissipation mechanism along a single directional pathway.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics and Stabilization of Zero-Mode Singularities in Multi-Scale Reaction-Diffusion Systems via Negative Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled System (MNCS), a dynamical model describing hierarchical state spaces with directed, sign-structured interactions. We address the stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems on bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \le 3$) subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. A critical feature of this setting is the "zero-mode singularity," where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\infty(\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula. We show that the dimension scales as $d_F(\mathcal{A}) \sim \max\{0, \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{A}}-\gamma\}^{d/2}$, confirming that the negative coupling strength $\gamma$ acts as a global regularizer that compresses the phase space. The theoretical results are validated using a stiff-stable Second-Order Exponential Time Differencing (ETD2) scheme with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to strictly enforce no-flux boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Stability for an Inverse Problem of Biharmonic Wave Equations with Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes Lipschitz stability for the simultaneous recovery of a variable density coefficient and the initial displacement in a damped biharmonic wave equation. The data consist of the boundary Cauchy data for the Laplacian of the solution, \(\Delta u |_{\partial \Omega}\) and \( \partial_{n}(\Delta u)|_{\partial \Omega}.\) We first prove that the associated system operator generates a contraction semigroup, which ensures the well-posedness of the forward problem. A key observability inequality is then derived via multiplier techniques. Building on this foundation, explicit stability estimates for the inverse problem are obtained. These estimates demonstrate that the biharmonic structure inherently enhances the stability of parameter identification, with the stability constants exhibiting an explicit dependence on the damping coefficient via the factor \( (1 + \gamma)^{1/2} \). This work provides a rigorous theoretical basis for applications in non-destructive testing and dynamic inversion.</description>

      <title>Global regularity estimates for $p(x)$-Laplacian variational inequalities with singular or degenerate matrix-valued weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global gradient bounds for weak solutions to the elliptic variational inequality with two-sided obstructions, associated with a $p(x)$-Laplacian type operator involving degenerate or singular matrix weights. Under the optimal regularity assumptions on the matrix-valued weight, suitable geometric flatness of the domain, and the prescribed data, we aim to investigate the effects of the problem structure on the level of integrability properties of solutions. To this end, we develop regularity in two regards: weighted Calder\'on-Zygmund-type and general weighted Orlicz-type estimates. A notable feature of our results is that, through a constructive level-set approach, the estimates can be derived with minimal dependence of the scaling parameter on the structural constants. The regularity results are then sharp in the sense that they enable the construction of a level-set estimate with nearly optimal scaling parameters, within admissible parameter sets.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for Physics Informed Neural Networks in Generalized KdV Equations placed on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a rigorous setting for the numerical approximation via deep neural networks of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) model in one dimension, for subcritical and critical nonlinearities, and assuming that the domain is the unbounded real line. The fact that the model is posed on the real line makes the problem difficult from the point of view of learning techniques, since the setting required to model gKdV is structured on intricate oscillatory estimates dating from Kato, Bourgain and Kenig, Ponce and Vega, among others. Therefore, a first task is to adapt the setting of these techniques to the deep learning setting. We shall use a battery of Kenig-Ponce-Vega suitable norms and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to describe this approximative scheme, proving rigorous bounds on the approximation for each critical and subcritical gKdV model. We shall use this results to provide clear approximation results in the case of several gKdV nonlinear patterns such as solitons, multi-solitons, breathers, among other solutions.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to investigate the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds. This question has been intensively studied (by Logvinenko--Sereda, Nazarov, Jerison--Lebeau, Kovrizhkin, Egidi--Seelmann--Veseli{\'c}, Burq--Moyano, among others) in connection with the uncertainty principle. We provide the first high-frequency results in a geometric setting which is neither Euclidean nor a perturbation of Euclidean. Namely, we prove the natural (and optimal) uncertainty principle for the spectral projector on the hyperbolic half-plane.</description>

Abstract: In light of recent work in the global well-posedness of solutions for an ionic Vlasov-Poisson system, as demonstrated by Griffin-Pickering and Iacobelli, the current work focuses on the moment propagation of the corresponding system in quasi-neutral regime. Such moment propagation result relies on an estimate of $Q_*(t)=|V(t;0,x,v)-V(0;0,x,v)|$, where $V(s;t,x,v)$ represents the solution of the characteristic ordinary differential equation associated with the Vlasov-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>A second microlocalization for the three-body calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series studying the quantum mechanical three-body problem within a modern microlocal framework. The project aims to demonstrate how the Helmholtz operator is a Fredholm map between suitable anisotropic Hilbert spaces. Notably, we will consider decoupled indices that measure decay at the spatial infinity. Despite the problem's rich history, new phenomena arise under this approach, particularly regarding diffraction. The treatment of this involves the second microlocalization framework introduced by Vasy for the two-body Helmholtz operator, which does not directly extend to the three-body case. This paper will clarify this structure. We will construct an algebra of operators, referred to as the three-cone algebra, which serves as a 'converse perspective' to the second microlocalization. This algebra exhibits a scattering structure at one boundary face and a specific fibered structure (corresponding to the scattering-fibered structure for the three-body algebra) at another, which are connected by a fibered cone. We show that introducing suitable blow-ups at the fiber infinity allows us to modify the three-cone algebra only at the symbolic level, thereby constructing the desired second microlocalized algebra. The presence of variable orders will also be considered. Finally, we prove basic properties for the second microlocalized algebra.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems from kinetic models for bacterial communities on a leaf surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem for elliptic equations with singular drift terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish $L^p$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem, for some finite $p$, in a 1-sided chord-arc domain $\Omega$ (i.e., a uniform domain with Ahlfors-David regular boundary), for elliptic equations of the form \[ Lu=-\text{div}(A\nabla u) + {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=:L_0 u+ {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=0, \] given that the analogous result holds (typically with a different value of $p$) for the homogeneous second order operator $L_0$. Essentially, we assume that $|{\bf B}(X)|\lesssim \text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega)^{-1}$, and that $|{\bf B}(X)|^2\text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega) dX$ is a Carleson measure in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Harnack inequalities for nonlocal double phase equations I ; with positive bounded modulating coefficient with no H\"older condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by applying the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory we prove nonlocal Harnack inequalities for (locally nonnegative in $\Omega$) weak solutions to nolocal double phase equations \begin{equation*}\begin{cases}\cL u =0 &amp; \text{ in $\Omega$,} \\ u=g &amp; \text{ in $\BR^n\s\Omega$ } \end{cases}\end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\BR^n$ ($n\ge 2$) is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, $\cL$ is the nonlocal double phase operator $\cL$ given by \begin{equation*}\begin{split}\cL u(x)=&amp;\pv\int_{\BR^n}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{ps}(x,y)\,dy \\ &amp;+\pv\int_{\BR^n}\fa(x,y)|u(x)-u(y)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{qt}(x,y)\,dy, \end{split} \end{equation*} $0&lt;\fa(x,y) = \fa(y,x) \le \|\fa\|_{L^\iy(\BR^n\times\BR^n)} &lt; \iy$ and $ps\ge qt$ for $0&lt;s,t&lt;1&lt;p\le q&lt;\iy$. In addition, we get local boundedness with explicit formula and weak Harnack inequalities for their weak supersolutions.</description>

      <title>Distortion of charge distribution due to internal electric fields described by the drift-diffusion semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities and asymptotics of McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for solutions to the McKean-Vlasov (granular media) equation on the flat torus in a genuinely nonconvex setting. Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-{\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials. This yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without convexity assumption and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows. In the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a prominent application.</description>

      <title>Continuous in time bubbling and Soliton Resolution for Non-negative Solutions of the Energy-Critical Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any finite energy solution of the energy-critical nonlinear heat flow in dimensions $d\geq 3$ asymptotically resolves into a sum of possibly time-dependent solitons, a radiation term, and an error term that vanishes in the energy space. As a consequence, when the initial data has finite energy and is non-negative, we settle the Soliton Resolution Conjecture for all dimensions $d\geq 3.$</description>

      <title>Homogenization with Guaranteed Bounds via Primal-Dual Physically Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; 2\gamma/(1+\gamma)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>
