      <title>Input layer regularization and automated regularization hyperparameter tuning for myelin water estimation using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning method which combines classical regularization with data augmentation for estimating myelin water fraction (MWF) in the brain via biexponential analysis. Our aim is to design an accurate deep learning technique for analysis of signals arising in magnetic resonance relaxometry. In particular, we study the biexponential model, one of the signal models used for MWF estimation. We greatly extend our previous work on \emph{input layer regularization (ILR)} in several ways. We now incorporate optimal regularization parameter selection via a dedicated neural network or generalized cross validation (GCV) on a signal-by-signal, or pixel-by-pixel, basis to form the augmented input signal, and now incorporate estimation of MWF, rather than just exponential time constants, into the analysis. On synthetically generated data, our proposed deep learning architecture outperformed both classical methods and a conventional multi-layer perceptron. On in vivo brain data, our architecture again outperformed other comparison methods, with GCV proving to be somewhat superior to a NN for regularization parameter selection. Thus, ILR improves estimation of MWF within the biexponential model. In addition, classical methods such as GCV may be combined with deep learning to optimize MWF imaging in the human brain.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.</description>

      <title>Fast fitting of phylogenetic mixed-effects models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-effects models are among the most commonly used statistical methods for the exploration of multispecies data. In recent years, also Joint Species Distribution Models and Generalized Linear Latent Variale Models have gained in popularity when the goal is to incorporate residual covariation between species that cannot be explained due to measured environmental covariates. Few software implementations of such models exist that can additionally incorporate phylogenetic information, and those that exist tend to utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimation, so that model fitting takes a long time. In this article we develop new methods for quickly and flexibly fitting phylogenetic mixed-effects models, potentially incorporating residual covariation between species using latent variables, with the possibility to estimate the strength of phylogenetic structuring in species responses per environmental covariate, and while incorporating correlation between different covariate effects. By combining Variational approximations, a sparse approximation to the phylogenetic precision matrix, and parallel computation, phylogenetic mixed-effects models can be fitted much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed combination of approximations is fast and enjoys high accuracy. We explore sensitivity of the approximation to the ordering of species with a real world dataset of wood-decaying fungi.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. Unlike GPS trackers which emit satellite signals from the animal's location, acoustic receivers are akin to stationary motion sensors that record movements within their detection range. Thus, for periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we devise and implement a simulation-based imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and random-walk principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</description>
