      <title>Contagion Effects of the Silicon Valley Bank Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the contagion effects associated with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and identifies bank-specific vulnerabilities contributing to the subsequent declines in banks' stock returns. We find that uninsured deposits, unrealized losses in held-to-maturity securities, bank size, and cash holdings had a significant impact, while better-quality assets or holdings of liquid securities did not help mitigate the negative spillovers. Interestingly, banks whose stocks performed worse post-SVB also experienced lower returns in the previous year, following Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Stock investors appeared to anticipate risks associated with uninsured deposit reliance, but did not foresee the realization of implied losses. While mid-sized banks experienced particular stress immediately after the SVB failure, over time negative spillovers became widespread except for the largest banks.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Treatment on Wash Trading of Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the liquidity of an asset includes two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion. We show that liquidity diffusion has a higher correlation with crypto wash trading than liquidity jump and demonstrate that treatment on wash trading significantly reduces the level of liquidity diffusion, but only marginally reduces that of liquidity jump. We confirm that the autoregressive models are highly effective in modeling the liquidity-adjusted return with and without the treatment on wash trading. We argue that treatment on wash trading is unnecessary in modeling established crypto assets that trade in unregulated but mainstream exchanges.</description>
