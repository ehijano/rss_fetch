      <title>Gauge invariant quantum transport theory for non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is a fundamental principle that must be preserved in quantum transport. However, when a complex potential is incorporated into the Hamiltonian, we find that the current described by the well-established Landauer-B$\ddot{u}$ttiker formula no longer satisfies gauge invariance. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, we derive a current expression for a multi-probe system that includes a complex potential in the scattering region. We observe that an additional current term arises compared to the Landauer-B$\ddot{u}$ttiker formula, which leads to a violation of gauge invariance. To address this, we propose two phenomenological methods for redistributing the conductance to restore gauge invariance in non-Hermitian systems. These methods are applied to various trivial and nontrivial non-Hermitian quantum states, confirming the necessity of gauge-invariant treatments in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Integration of solid-state nanopore arrays via dry bonding to photostructured microfluidic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration and parallelization of nanopore sensors are essential for improving the throughput of nanopore measurements. Solid-state nanopores traditionally have been used in isolation, which prevents the realization of their full potential in applications. In this study, we present the microfluidic integration of an array of 30 nanopores, which, to our knowledge, is the highest number reported to date. Our microfluidic network was fabricated using high-resolution epoxy photoresists, and the solid-state membranes were bonded through a dry process using complementary surface chemistries. We successfully measured integrated nanopores using external electrodes. This paper discusses the limitations of our methods, particularly concerning microfluidic interfacing and scaling to higher channel counts. Additionally, we present theoretical analysis of current blockades and noise in integrated nanopores, predicting that maintaining low series resistance between the nanopore and electrode is crucial for resolving short events.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry in condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated accomplishments of modern physics is the description of fundamental principles of nature in the language of geometry. As the motion of celestial bodies is governed by the geometry of spacetime, the motion of electrons in condensed matter can be characterized by the geometry of the Hilbert space of their wave functions. Such quantum geometry, comprising of Berry curvature and quantum metric, can thus exert profound influences on various properties of materials. The dipoles of both Berry curvature and quantum metric produce nonlinear transport. The quantum metric plays an important role in flat-band superconductors by enhancing the transition temperature. The uniformly distributed momentum-space quantum geometry stabilizes the fractional Chern insulators and results in the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. We here review in detail quantum geometry in condensed matter, paying close attention to its effects on nonlinear transport, superconductivity, and topological properties. Possible future research directions in this field are also envisaged.</description>

      <title>Ultra spectral sensitivity and non-local bi-impurity bound states from quasi-long-range non-hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that the energy spectrum of a quantum system shall remain stable against infinitesimally weak and spatially confined perturbations. In this article, we demonstrate that this principle of spectral stability fails in non-Hermitian systems at the thermodynamic limit. Consider, for instance, a non-interacting non-Hermitian system $H_0$ with a couple of point-like impurities, each of which introduces a local short-range potential $V_i$ with $i=1, \ldots, n$ labeling the impurities. If the impurity potentials are sufficiently weak, introducing a single impurity will not alter the spectrum; that is, $H_0$ and $H_0 + V_1$ have nearly identical energy spectra. However, if a second impurity is introduced, $H_0 + V_1 + V_2$, we find that no matter how weak these local potentials are, as long as the distance between them is sufficiently large, significant alterations in the energy spectrum can arise, directly contradicting the traditional expectation of a stable spectrum. Remarkably, this phenomenon is non-local, and the impact of the perturbations increases exponentially with the distance between the two impurities. In other words, although the Hamiltonian is entirely local, its energy spectrum, which is blind to the presence of a single infinitesimally weak impurity, is capable of detecting the presence of two infinitesimally weak impurities separated by a large distance in space. Using Green's function techniques, we uncover the origin of this spectral sensitivity, which arises from the formation of non-local bi-impurity bound states: non-local stationary states with wavepackets propagating back-and-forth between the two impurities. We provide an analytic theory to identify and characterize such spectral instabilities, showing perfect agreement with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Frequency comb in a macroscopic mechano-magnetic artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets exhibiting frustration. Their resonant magnetization dynamics have been broadly investigated from fundamental and applied points of view. In this work, we realize a dynamically driven macroscopic mechano-magnetic artificial spin ice, or macro-ASI, where permanent magnets are allowed to rotate on specially designed hinges and exhibit natural resonance frequencies on the order of several Hertz. A nonlinear dynamical regime is achieved experimentally and well reproduced by numerical modelling. The modulation of the magnetic coupling leads to a frequency comb that manifests itself as an amplitude-phase modulation of the magnets' motion due to a metastable condition, i.e., a Hopf bifurcation. Our results not only demonstrate a striking similarity across different physical systems, but also suggest that the mechanism to enable nonlinear phenomena could be realized in nanoscale systems using microresonators decorated with magnetic materials to dynamically modulate their coupling.</description>

      <title>Influence of Aharonov-Bohm flux and dual gaps on electron scattering in graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the Aharonov-Bohm flux (AB) $\phi_i$ and the dual gaps $(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)$ can affect the electron scattering in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of radius $r_0$ in the presence of an electrostatic potential $V$. After obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we explicitly determine the radial component of the reflected current $J_r^r$, the square modulus of the scattering coefficients $|c_m|^2$, and the scattering efficiency $Q$. Different scattering regimes are identified based on physical parameters such as incident energy $E$, $V$, $r_0$, dual gaps, and $\phi_i$. In particular, we show that lower values of $E$ are associated with larger amplitudes of $Q$. Furthermore, it is found that $Q$ exhibits a damped oscillatory behavior with increasing the AB flux. In addition, increasing the external gap $\Delta_1$ resulted in higher values of $Q$. By increasing $\phi_i$, we show that the oscillations in $|c_m|^2$ disappear for larger values of $r_0$ and are replaced by prominent peaks at certain values of $E$ and angular momentum $m$. Finally, we show that $J_{r}^r$ displays periodic oscillations of constant amplitude, which are affected by the AB flux.</description>

      <title>Check-probe spectroscopy of lifetime-limited emitters in bulk-grown silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum technologies such as optically connected quantum networks. A key challenge is to ensure optical coherence and spectral stability of the emitters. Here, we introduce a high-bandwidth `check-probe' scheme to quantitatively measure (laser-induced) spectral diffusion and ionisation rates, as well as homogeneous linewidths. We demonstrate these methods on single V2 centers in commercially available bulk-grown 4H-silicon carbide. Despite observing significant spectral diffusion under laser illumination ($\gtrsim$ GHz/s), the optical transitions are narrow ($\sim$35 MHz), and remain stable in the dark ($\gtrsim$1 s). Through Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interferometry, we determine the optical coherence to be near-lifetime limited ($T_2 = 16.4(4)$ ns), hinting at the potential for using bulk-grown materials for developing quantum technologies. These results advance our understanding of spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in semiconductor materials, and may have applications for studying charge dynamics across other platforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglemons: Cross-platform protected qubits from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Equilibrium 4$\pi$-Periodic Josephson Effect from Poor Man's Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Josephson diode effect becomes possible when two coupled antiferromagnetic dimers of point-like magnetic adatoms are deposited on top of a Rashba superconductor. The degree of nonreciprocity is substantial when the arising Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states approach zero energy. In this limit, these states behave as weakly coupled poor man's Majorana (PMM) excitations. The emergence of PMMs leads to highly dispersive and phase-bias asymmetric Andreev bound state dispersions. In turn, these result in a nonreciprocal Josephson current, whose diode efficiency can be controlled by varying the geometric details of the adatom's spatial configuration. In addition, thanks to spin-triplet pairing terms mixing different YSR states, the resulting Josephson effect is $4\pi$-periodic even under equilibrium conditions. Our work opens the door to observing and harnessing Majorana behavior in currently experimentally accessible topologically trivial systems.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influences the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully controllable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show that a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work paves the way for analog molecule simulators based on quantum superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Dynamical non-linear optical response in time-periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalism for calculating the linear and nonlinear optical response of time-periodic (Floquet) quantum systems. Our approach, based on density matrix evolution in the Floquet basis, employs the length gauge and incorporates both intraband and interband contributions of the position operator. This formalism enables the interpretation of optical responses in terms of photon-assisted transitions and reveals a unique, divergent AC response to DC fields in Floquet systems, analogous to a Drude peak at finite frequency. Importantly, our method generalizes to optical tensor conductivity calculations at arbitrary perturbation orders, providing a powerful tool for analyzing driven quantum systems. Additionally, this approach captures various DC photocurrents, including shift current, injection current, gyration current, Berry dipole contributions, and intrinsic Fermi surface effects in certain limits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate novel quantum dynamics of fractional Stark ladders supported by space-time SSH lattices, unveiling a series of remarkable phenomena: 1. symmetric quasispectrum characterized by electric translation group; 2. robust dynamical localization of electrons under Floquet drives; 3. identification of dynamical edge modes as Floquet time crystals. Intriguingly, the realization of Floquet time crystals in our model does not require electron interactions but emerges from the extraordinary interplay between electromagnetic gauge and lattice degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on rf measurement schemes involving costly and complex instrumentation. Here we demonstrate a simple dc measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the dc signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple dc measurement, has a wide band up to 200 GHz, well exceeding that of the typical rf spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal, unlike the conventional rf measurement. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique thus offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits, which is in many ways superior with respect to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Universal symmetry-protected persistent spin textures in nonmagnetic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of Mendeleev's periodic table extends beyond the classification of elements; it lies in its remarkable predictive power for discovering new elements and properties, revealing the underlying symmetrical patterns of nature that were only fully understood with the advent of quantum mechanics. Fundamental material properties, such as electron transport and magnetism, are also governed by crystal symmetry. In particular, spin transport depends on the spin polarization of electronic states, and recently discovered materials where the electron spin polarization is independent of momentum - a property known as a persistent spin texture (PST) - promise extended spin lifetime and efficient spin accumulation. In this paper, we establish the general conditions for the existence of symmetry-protected PST in bulk crystals. By systematically analyzing all 230 crystallographic space groups, similar to elements in the periodic table, we demonstrate that PST is universally present in all nonmagnetic solids lacking inversion symmetry. Using group theory, we identify the regions within the Brillouin zone that host PST and determine the corresponding directions of spin polarization. Our findings, supported by first-principles calculations of representative materials, open the route for discovering robust spintronic materials based on PST.</description>

      <title>Cornertronics in Two-Dimensional Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>

Abstract: Traditional electronic devices rely on the electron's intrinsic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) to process information. However, additional d.o.f. like the valley, can emerge in the low-energy states of certain systems. Here, we show that the quantum dots (QDs) constructed from two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulators (SOTI) posses a new kind of d.o.f., namely corner freedom, related to the topological corner states that reside at different corners of the systems. Since the corner states are well separated in real space, they can be individually and intuitively manipulated, giving rise to the concept of cornertronics. Via symmetry analysis and material search, we identify the TiSiCO-family monolayers as the first prototype of cornertronics materials, where the corner states can be controlled by both electric and optical fields, due to novel corner-layer coupling (CLC) effect and corner-contrasted linear dichroism. Furthermore, we find that the band gap of the TiSiCO nanodisk lies in the terahertz region and is robust to size reduction. These results indicate that the TiSiCO nanodisks can be used to design terahertz devices with ultrasmall size and electric-field tunable band gap. Besides, the TiSiCO nanodisks are simultaneously sensitive to both the strength and polarization of the terahertz waves. Our findings not only pave the way for cornertronics, but also open a new direction for research in 2D SOTI, QD and terahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic temperature dependence of electron viscosity and crossover to high-temperature universal viscous fluid in monolayer and bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons in quantum matter behave like a fluid when the quantum-mechanical carrier-carrier scattering dominates over other relaxation mechanisms. By combining a microscopic treatment of electron-electron interactions within the random phase approximation with a phenomenological Navier-Stokes like equation, we predict that in the limit of high temperature and strong Coulomb interactions, both monolayer and bilayer graphene exhibit a universal behavior in dynamic viscosity. We find that the dynamic viscosity to entropy density ratio for bilayer graphene is closer to the holographic bound suggesting that such a bound might be observable in a condensed matter system. We discuss how this could be observed experimentally using a magnetoconductance measurements in a Corbino geometry for a realistic range of temperature and carrier density.</description>

      <title>Resonant phonons: Localization in a structurally ordered crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon localization is a phenomenon that influences numerous material properties in condensed matter physics. Anderson localization brings rise to localized atomic-scale phonon interferences in disordered lattices with an influence limited to high-frequency phonons having wavelengths comparable to the size of a randomly perturbed unit cell. Here we theoretically reveal a new form of phonon localization induced by augmenting a crystalline material with intrinsic phonon nanoresonators with feature sizes that can be smaller or larger than the phonon wavelengths but must be relatively small compared to the phonon mean free paths. This mechanism is deterministic and takes place within numerous discrete narrow-frequency bands spread throughout the full spectrum with central frequencies controlled by design. For demonstration, we run molecular dynamics simulations of all-silicon nanopillared membranes at room temperature, and apply to the underlying thermalized environment narrowband wave packets as an excitation at precisely the frequencies where resonant hybridizations are evident in the anharmonic phonon band structure. Upon comparison to other frequency ranges where the nanostructure does not exhibit local resonances, significant intrinsic spatial phonon localization along the direction of transport is explicitly observed. Furthermore, the energy exchange with external sources is minimized at the resonant frequencies. We conclude by making a direct comparison with Anderson localization highlighting the superiority of the resonant phonons across both sides of the interference frequency limit.</description>

      <title>Electronic Excitations in the Bulk of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze electronic excitations (excitations generated by adding or removing one electron) in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall states in Jain sequence states, using composite fermion Chern-Simons field theory. Starting from meanfield approximation in which gauge field fluctuations are neglected, we use symmetry to constrain the possible composite fermion states contributing to electronic Green's function and expect discrete infinitely-sharp peaks in the electronic spectral function. We further consider the electronic excitations in particle-hole conjugate fractional quantum hall states. Gauge field fluctuations play an increasingly important role in the electron spectral function as the filling factor approaches 1/2, and evolve the discrete coherent peaks into a broad continuum even in the absence of impurities. At that limit, we switch to the electron perspective and calculate the electron spectral function via linked cluster approximation from the low to intermediate energy range. Finally, we compare our results with recent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the electron orbital degree of freedom in heterostructures is attracting increasing attention due to the possibility of achieving much larger conversion rates between charge and orbital angular momentum flow compared to the intrinsic electron spin. Here, we consider orbital angular momentum currents in a tight-binding multiorbital lattice model and derive their continuity equation. From it, we observe that the current is not conserved and apply similar considerations to the recently discovered altermagnets. We find nonzero orbital torque terms, elucidate their physical mechanism, and show numerically that they contribute to dampening the orbital angular momentum current flowing in multiorbital heterostructures. Moreover, we compute the orbital RKKY interaction and find it exhibits similar characteristics as the orbital angular momentum current mediating it, thus serving as a direct experimental probe of such currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb-driven bound states of electrons and holes, are typically composed of integer charges. However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge fractionalization, a more exotic form of interlayer exciton can emerge, where pairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite numerous theoretical predictions for such fractional excitons, their experimental observation has remained elusive. Here, we report transport signatures of excitonic pairing within fractional quantum Hall effect states. By probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying wavefunction, we uncover two novel quantum phases of matter. One of these orders can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at a total filling of one, while the other involves a more unusual type of exciton that obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard paradigm of bosonic excitons.</description>

      <title>Spectral heat flux redistribution upon interfacial transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonmetallic crystals, heat is transported by phonons of different frequencies, each contributing differently to the overall heat flux spectrum. In this study, we demonstrate a significant redistribution of heat flux among phonon frequencies when phonons transmit across the interface between dissimilar solids. This redistribution arises from the natural tendency of phononic heat to re-establish the equilibrium distribution characteristic of the material through which it propagates. Remarkably, while the heat flux spectra of dissimilar solids are typically distinct in their bulk forms, they can become nearly identical in superlattices or sandwich structures where the layer thicknesses are smaller than the phonon mean free paths. This phenomenon reflects that the redistribution of heat among phonon frequencies to the equilibrium distribution does not occur instantaneously at the interface, rather it develops over some time and distance.</description>

      <title>Full minimal coupling Maxwell-TDDFT: an ab initio framework for light-matter phenomena beyond the dipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first ab initio, non-relativistic QED method that couples light and matter self-consistently beyond the electric dipole approximation and without multipolar truncations. This method is based on an extension of the Maxwell-Pauli-Kohn-Sham approach to a full minimal coupling Hamiltonian, where the space- and time-dependent vector potential is coupled to the matter system, and its back-reaction to the radiated fields is generated by the full current density. The implementation in the open-source Octopus code is designed for massively-parallel multiscale simulations considering different grid spacings for the Maxwell and matter subsystems. Here, we show the first applications of this framework to simulate renormalized Cherenkov radiation of an electronic wavepacket, magnetooptical effects with non-chiral light in non-chiral molecular systems, and renormalized plasmonic modes in a nanoplasmonic dimer. We show that in some cases the beyond-dipole effects can not be captured by a multipolar expansion Hamiltonian in the length gauge. Finally, we discuss further opportunities enabled by the framework in the field of twisted light and orbital angular momentum, inelastic light scattering and strong field physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions such that the time evolution of a mesoscopic tight-binding open system with a local Hartree-Fock non-linearity converges to a self-consistent non-equilibrium steady state, which is independent of the initial condition from the "small sample". We also show that the steady charge current intensities are given by Landauer-B\"uttiker-like formulas, and make the connection with the case of weakly self-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>Current and shot noise in a normal metal-superconductor junction driven by spin-dependent periodic pulse sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the junction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an incident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the superconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal metal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the current due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in spin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and numerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction, when the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different periodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the superconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the spin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives are different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise depends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular the case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get modified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple analytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact mapping to a particular N-N junction.</description>

Abstract: A zero-magnetic-field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is observed in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mediated by Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. We argue that a phase coupling between the surface and bulk superconducting channels, a unique phenomenon recently identified in the observations of fractional Josephson effect and Leggett modes in Cd3As2, can break time reversal symmetry and therefore give rise to the zero-field JDE. Our results are anticipated to have important implications in superconducting electronic circuit applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with periodic driving as a powerful tool for designing desirable topological states has been the subject of intense recent studies. Here, we present the application of Floquet engineering to investigate evolution of topological triple fermions under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL), a phenomenon that currently remains a mystery. By using first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type TiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of triple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL can break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its combination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly controllable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled by light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry line or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on Floquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would facilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.</description>

Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>
