      <title>H3PC: Hypersonic, High-Order, High-Performance Code with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and Real Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a hypersonic high-order, high-performance code (H$^3$PC) utilizing the ``Trixi.jl" framework in order to simulate both non-reactive and chemically reactive compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for complex three-dimensional geometries. H$^3$PC is parallel on CPU platforms and can perform exascale parallel computations of hypersonic turbulent flows. The numerical approach is based on the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, satisfying the entropy and energy stability conditions for the Euler equations. H$^3$PC can perform simulations of high-speed flows from subsonic to hypersonic speeds based on frozen, equilibrium, and non-equilibrium chemistry modeling of the gas mixture, using the \texttt{Mutation.jl} , which is a Julia package developed to wrap the C++-based Mutation++ library. H$^3$PC can also perform parallel adaptive mesh refinement for two- and three-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes discretizations with non-conforming elements. In this study, we first demonstrate the successful integration of Mutation++ into the H$^3$PC solver, and then verify its accuracy through simulations of Taylor-Green vortex flow, supersonic flow past a square and circular cylinder, and hypersonic P8-inlet.</description>

      <title>Generation of Granular Deposition Interfaces using conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at generating 1D interface profiles of granular deposition by a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Our cGAN model employs a U-Net generator and a ResNet discriminator that, in competition with each other, produce granular interfaces. The network is trained on dynamic simulation data from the LAMMPS granular package. Different fluids (water, acetone, and hexane) were used for the medium of the deposition cell to check the model performance in different growing conditions. The same model with the same hyperparameters was trained on data from different media separately. The ML-generated interfaces are compared with those of dynamic simulations, and a large number of interfaces are then produced to obtain more stable statistical properties of granular deposition. This way, the computationally extensive molecular dynamics simulation is substituted by the AI model. The statistical trend of interface growth is diagrammed, and the generated interfaces are also analyzed in terms of statistical features. Keywords: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, ResNet, U-Net, Granular Deposition, Interface Growth.</description>

      <title>A fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving method for adjoint shape optimization of rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint based shape optimization is a powerful technique in fluid-dynamics optimization, capable of identifying an optimal shape within only dozens of design iterations. However, when extended to rarefied gas flows, the computational cost becomes enormous because both the six dimensional primal and adjoint Boltzmann equations must be solved for each candidate shape. Building on the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) for solving the primal Boltzmann model equation, this paper presents a fast converging and asymptotic preserving method for solving the adjoint kinetic equation. The GSIS accelerates the convergence of the adjoint kinetic equation by incorporating solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations, whose constitutive relations include the Newtonian stress law along with higher order terms capturing rarefaction effects. As a result, the method achieves asymptotic preservation (allowing the use of large spatial cell sizes in the continuum limit) while maintaining accuracy in highly rarefied regimes. Numerical tests demonstrate exceptional performance on drag minimization problems for 3D bodies, achieving drag reductions of 34.5% in the transition regime and 61.1% in the slip-flow regime within roughly ten optimization iterations. For each candidate shape, converged solutions of the primal and adjoint Boltzmann equation are obtained with only a few dozen updates of the velocity distribution function, dramatically reducing computational cost compared with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Fast-Converging and Asymptotic-Preserving DSMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has become increasingly urgent with the rapid development of space exploration. To address this issue, the direct intermittent general synthetic iteration (DIG) scheme has recently been proposed to enable DSMC's rapid and accurate convergence to steady-state solutions, even when the cell size is much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes. The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties. Because the Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, the analysis is conducted using the linearized BGK model. It is found that, in the near continuum flow regime, the DIG method asymptotically recovers the Navier Stokes equations when the cell size is O(1), rather than being constrained by the mean free path. Moreover, after a single cycle of DIG evolution, the deviation from the final steady state solution is reduced by more than a factor of five. In the second part of the paper, the Poiseuille flow and hypersonic flow passing over cylinder are investigated using the DIG scheme, with different time step and cell sizes, thereby demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in multiscale flow simulation. Specifically, when the Knudsen number is 0.01, the DIG method is found to be faster than the traditional DSMC method by two orders of magnitude. The performance gain becomes even greater at smaller Knudsen numbers. The proposed method holds great potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Interfaces at Constant Potential: Data-Efficient Transfer Learning for Machine-Learning-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating electrified metal/water interfaces with explicit solvent under constant potential is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, yet remains prohibitively expensive with ab initio methods. We present TRECI, a data-efficient workflow for constructing machine learning force-fields (ML-FFs) that achieve ab initio-level accuracy in electronically grand-canonical molecular dynamics. By leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose and domain-specific models, TRECI enables stable and accurate simulations across a wide potential range using a reduced number of reference configurations. This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported. TRECI offers a general strategy for characterising diverse materials and interfacial chemistries, significantly lowering the cost of realistic constant-potential simulations and expanding access to quantitative electrochemical modelling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</description>

      <title>Probing Antiferromagnetic Hysteresis on Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Iterative improvement of free energy landscape reconstructions with optimal protocols derived from differentiable simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy landscapes encode the kinetics, intermediates, and transition states that govern molecular processes and are thus a key target of single biomolecule research. Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Dispersion and Low-Frequency Plasmons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Appraising the absolute limits of nanotubes and nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.</description>

      <title>Noise-Adaptive Quantum Circuit Mapping for Multi-Chip NISQ Systems via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to distributed multi-chip quantum architectures has fundamentally altered the circuit compilation landscape, introducing challenges in managing temporal noise variations and minimizing expensive inter-chip operations. We present DeepQMap, a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Dynamic Noise Adaptation (DNA) network with multi-head attention mechanisms and Rainbow DQN architecture. Unlike conventional static optimization approaches such as QUBO formulations, our method continuously adapts to hardware dynamics through learned temporal representations of quantum system behavior. Comprehensive evaluation across 270 benchmark circuits spanning Quantum Fourier Transform, Grover's algorithm, and Variational Quantum Eigensolver demonstrates that DeepQMap achieves mean circuit fidelity of $0.920 \pm 0.023$, representing a statistically significant 49.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO methods ($0.618 \pm 0.031$, $t_{98} = 4.87$, $p = 0.0023$, Cohen's $d = 2.34$). Inter-chip communication overhead reduces by 79.8\%, decreasing from 2.34 operations per circuit to 0.47. The DNA network maintains noise prediction accuracy with coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.912$ and mean absolute error of 0.87\%, enabling proactive compensation for hardware fluctuations. Scalability analysis confirms sustained performance across 20-100 qubit systems, with fidelity remaining above 0.87 even at maximum scale where competing methods degrade below 0.60. Training convergence occurs 8.2$\times$ faster than baseline approaches, completing in 45 minutes versus 370 minutes for QUBO optimization. Very large effect sizes validate practical significance for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Framework for Glassy Polymer Viscoelasticity Across 20 Frequency Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy polymers are central to engineering applications, yet their viscoelastic response over broad frequency and temperature ranges remains difficult to characterize. We extend non-affine deformation theory by incorporating a time-dependent memory kernel within the Generalized Langevin Equation for atomistic non-affine motions, yielding frequency-dependent mechanical response. Applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the method captures the shear modulus and relaxation spectrum across more than twenty decades in frequency, from hundreds of terahertz down to the millihertz regime, thus bridging polymer mechanics from ordinary to extreme scales. Our predictions show quantitative consistency with independent estimates from oscillatory-shear molecular dynamics, Brillouin scattering, ultrasonic spectroscopy, Split-Hopkinson testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), demonstrating a unified theoretical-computational route for multiscale characterization of polymer glasses.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dependent Polarity of Interfacial Energy Flow in Functionalized CNT Polymer Nanocomposites: A Reactive Molecular Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer composites are widely engineered using surface coatings and chemical treatments to improve interfacial bonding and load transfer. It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical interplay between coupled scalar dark sectors and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation of rapidly distorted turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm to simulate rapidly distorted turbulence via linear combination of Hamiltonian (LCHS). The algorithm comprises three primary stages: the efficient preparation of an initial turbulent state with a prescribed energy spectrum, its subsequent time evolution via LCHS, and the direct measurement of key turbulence statistics. Our analysis indicates that the algorithm can offer a practical quantum speedup over the classical simulation methods for a sufficiently large computational grid. We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for simulating a minimal instance of non-trivial turbulence with classical validation. The numerical results show excellent agreement with ground-truth solutions, capturing both the qualitative evolution of turbulent fields and the quantitative behavior of statistics, including the Reynolds stresses and the fluctuating velocity spectrum. Despite its linearity, rapidly distorted turbulence captures essential turbulence mechanisms and may inform the development of quantum algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations. Our work establishes a foundation for addressing more complex turbulent phenomena on future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Guesswork in the gap: the impact of uncertainty in the compact binary population on source classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the compact objects within the supposed "lower mass gap" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by &lt;10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Simulator for Electrically Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software.
  This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5 aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some features of the CUDACPP software which had not yet been documented, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error accumulation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman-inspired loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>

      <title>General ab initio framework for chiral phonons induced by electronic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional ab initio methods fail to describe the emergence of chiral phonons driven by electronic ordering. Here, we develop an ab initio framework, grounded in molecular Berry curvature (MBC), that captures electronic-order-driven symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics and is applicable to both insulating and metallic magnets. Using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a model system, we show that the MBC term simultaneously breaks time-reversal and mirror symmetries, enabling a quantitative reproduction of the experimentally observed phonon splittings. The analysis uncovers distinct microscopic origins for the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes: the $E_g$ splitting is governed by MBC and is accurately described by our first-principles scheme, whereas the $E_u$ splitting is enhanced by the Fano resonance, consistent with its asymmetric spectral profile. Leveraging this framework, we further predict several candidates with chiral-phonon splitting. Our results establish a predictive route for identifying and understanding phonon magnetism, chiral phonons, and related Hall-type lattice responses from first principles.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>
