      <title>Derandomizing Matrix Concentration Inequalities from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, sharp matrix concentration inequalities~\cite{BBvH23,BvH24} were developed using the theory of free probability. In this work, we design polynomial time deterministic algorithms to construct outcomes that satisfy the guarantees of these inequalities. As direct consequences, we obtain polynomial time deterministic algorithms for the matrix Spencer problem~\cite{BJM23} and for constructing near-Ramanujan graphs. Our proofs show that the concepts and techniques in free probability are useful not only for mathematical analyses but also for efficient computations.</description>

      <title>On the parameterized complexity of the Maker-Breaker domination game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction as a Maker-Breaker positional game by Duch\^ene et al. in 2020, the Maker-Breaker domination game has become one of the most studied positional games on vertices. In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins.
  Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs.
  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number.</description>

      <title>Rational degree is polynomially related to degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathrm{deg}(f) \leq 2 \, \mathrm{rdeg}(f)^4$ for every Boolean function $f$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{rdeg}(f)$ is the rational degree of $f$. This resolves the second of the three open problems stated by Nisan and Szegedy, and attributed to Fortnow, in 1994.</description>

      <title>Extended formulations for induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give two extended space formulations, respectively, for the induced tree and path polytopes of chordal graphs with vertex and edge variables.
  These formulations are obtained by proving that the induced tree and path extended incidence vectors of chordal graphs form Hilbert basis. This also shows that both polytopes have the integer decomposition property in chordal graphs.
  Whereas the formulation for the induced tree polytope is easily seen to have a compact size, the system we provide for the induced path polytope has an exponential number of inequalities.
  We show which of these inequalities define facets and exhibit a superset of the facet-defining ones that can be enumerated in polynomial time. We show that for some graphs, the latter superset contains redundant inequalities.
  As corollaries, we obtain that the problems of finding an induced tree or path maximizing a linear function over the edges and vertices are solvable in polynomial time for the class of chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Edge densities of drawings of graphs with one forbidden cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected topological drawing of a graph divides the plane into a number of cells. The type of a cell $c$ is the cyclic sequence of crossings and vertices along the boundary walk of $c$. For example, all triangular cells with three incident crossings and no incident vertex share the same cell type. When a non-homotopic drawing of an $n$-vertex multigraph $G$ does not contain any such cells, Ackerman and Tardos [JCTA 2007] proved that $G$ has at most $8n-20$ edges, while Kaufmann, Klemz, Knorr, Reddy, Schr\"oder, and Ueckerdt [GD 2024] showed that this bound is tight. In this paper, we initiate the in-depth study of non-homotopic drawings that do not contain one fixed cell type \celltype, and investigate the edge density of the corresponding multigraphs, i.e., the maximum possible number of edges. We consider non-homotopic as well as simple drawings, multigraphs as well as simple graphs, and every possible type of cell. For every combination of drawing style, graph type, and cell type, we give upper and lower bounds on the corresponding edge density. With the exception of the cell type with four incident crossings and no incident vertex, we show for every cell type \celltype that the edge density of $n$-vertex (multi)graphs with \celltype-free drawings is either linear in $n$ or superlinear in $n$. In most cases, our bounds are tight up to an additive constant. We further consider cell types that are not incident to any crossing in more detail and find that all connected simple graphs but a short list of exceptions admit a simple drawing that does not contain any such cells. Additionally, we improve the current lower bound on the edge density of simple graphs that admit a non-homotopic quasiplanar drawing from $7n-28$ to $7.5n-28$.</description>
