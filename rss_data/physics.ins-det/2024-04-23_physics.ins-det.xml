      <title>Harmonic analysis of atomic vapor magnetization for in situ calibration of tri-axial time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed in static condition would be inaccurate. The coil constants are determined in a two-step procedure. Considering the presence of a static and of a time-dependent field, firstly, the static one is oriented perpendicularly to the polarization plane of a time dependent one; secondly, the polarization of the latter is made accurately circular. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow the time-dependent field.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Instrument for Measuring Soft Material Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft material research has seen significant growth in recent years, with emerging applications in robotics, electronics, and healthcare diagnostics where understanding material mechanical response is crucial for precision design. Traditional methods for measuring nonlinear mechanical properties of soft materials require specially sized samples that are extracted from their natural environment to be mounted on the testing instrument. This has been shown to compromise data accuracy and precision in various soft and biological materials. To overcome this, the Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE) method was developed. This technique tests soft materials by controlling the formation rate of a liquid cavity inside the materials at the tip of an injection needle, and simultaneously measuring the resisting pressure which describes the material response. Despite VCCE's early successes, expansion of its application beyond academia has been hindered by cost, size, and expertise. In response to this, the first portable, bench-top instrument utilizing VCCE is presented here. This device, built with affordable, readily available components and open-source software, streamlines VCCE experimentation without sacrificing performance or precision. It is especially suitable for space-limited settings and designed for use by non-experts, promoting widespread adoption. The instrument's efficacy was demonstrated through testing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples of varying stiffness. This study not only validates instrument performance, but also sets the stage for further advancements and broader applications in soft material testing. All data, along with acquisition, control, and post-processing scripts, are made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Optimization of GEM detectors for applications in X-ray fluorescence imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a set of simulations that aim at the optimization of gaseous detectors for applications in X-ray fluorescence imaging in the energy range of 3 -- 30keV is presented. By studying the statistical distribution of the radiation interactions with gases, the energy resolution limits after charge multiplication for 6keV X-ray photons in Ar/CO$_2$(70/30) and Kr/CO$_2$(90/10) were calculated, obtaining energy resolutions of 15.4(4)% and 14.6(2)% respectively. The detector design was also studied to reduce the presence of escape peaks and complement a model to evaluate the inevitable X-ray fluorescence of copper generated by the conductive materials inside the detector.</description>

      <title>Investigating Resource-efficient Neutron/Gamma Classification ML Models Targeting eFPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest and resulting progress in implementing machine learning (ML) models in hardware over the last several years from the particle and nuclear physics communities. A big driver has been the release of the Python package, hls4ml, which has enabled porting models specified and trained using Python ML libraries to register transfer level (RTL) code. So far, the primary end targets have been commercial FPGAs or synthesized custom blocks on ASICs. However, recent developments in open-source embedded FPGA (eFPGA) frameworks now provide an alternate, more flexible pathway for implementing ML models in hardware. These customized eFPGA fabrics can be integrated as part of an overall chip design. In general, the decision between a fully custom, eFPGA, or commercial FPGA ML implementation will depend on the details of the end-use application. In this work, we explored the parameter space for eFPGA implementations of fully-connected neural network (fcNN) and boosted decision tree (BDT) models using the task of neutron/gamma classification with a specific focus on resource efficiency. We used data collected using an AmBe sealed source incident on Stilbene, which was optically coupled to an OnSemi J-series SiPM to generate training and test data for this study. We investigated relevant input features and the effects of bit-resolution and sampling rate as well as trade-offs in hyperparameters for both ML architectures while tracking total resource usage. The performance metric used to track model performance was the calculated neutron efficiency at a gamma leakage of 10$^{-3}$. The results of the study will be used to aid the specification of an eFPGA fabric, which will be integrated as part of a test chip.</description>

      <title>LIGO operates with quantum noise below the Standard Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>X-ray Interferometry Using a Modulated Phase Grating: Theory and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray grating interferometry allows for the simultaneous acquisition of attenuation, differential-phase contrast, and dark-field images, resulting from X-ray attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering, respectively. The modulated phase grating (MPG) interferometer is a recently developed grating interferometry system capable of generating a directly resolvable interference pattern using a relatively large period grating envelope function that is sampled at a pitch that allows for X-ray spatial coherence using a microfocus X-ray source or by use of a source G0 grating that follows the Lau condition. We present the theory of the MPG interferometry system for a 2-dimensional staggered grating, derived using Fourier optics, and we compare the theoretical predictions with experiments we have performed with a microfocus X-ray system at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LSU. The theoretical and experimental fringe visibility is evaluated as a function of grating-to-detector distance. Quantitative experiments are performed with porous carbon and alumina samples, and qualitative analysis of attenuation and dark-field images of a dried anchovy are shown.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive and efficient 1550 nm photodetector for room temperature operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective quantum communication requires room temperature (RT) operating single photon sensor with high photo detection efficiency (PDE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photo detectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. Often the requirements for RT operation and for the high PDE are in conflict, resulting in a compromised solution. We have developed a device which employs a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by orders of magnitude and increase the PDE. The device is predicted to achieve RT operation with a PDE &gt;99%. Harnessing the high carrier mobility of 2D materials, the device has ~ps jitter time and can be integrated into a large 2D array camera.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Charged Track Reconstruction for CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of charged particle track reconstruction in CLAS12 using artificial intelligence. In our approach, we use machine learning algorithms to reconstruct tracks, including their momentum and direction, with high accuracy from raw hits of the CLAS12 drift chambers. The reconstruction is performed in real-time, with the rate of data acquisition, and allows for the identification of event topologies in real-time. This approach revolutionizes the Nuclear Physics experiments' data processing, allowing us to identify and categorize the experimental data on the fly, and will lead to a significant reduction in experiment data processing. It can also be used in streaming readout applications leading to more efficient data acquisition and post-processing.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the differential cross section for neutral pion production in charged-current muon neutrino interactions on argon with the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of neutral pion production in charged-current interactions using data recorded with the MicroBooNE detector exposed to Fermilab's booster neutrino beam. The signal comprises one muon, one neutral pion, any number of nucleons, and no charged pions. Studying neutral pion production in the MicroBooNE detector provides an opportunity to better understand neutrino-argon interactions, and is crucial for future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. Using a dataset corresponding to $6.86 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target, we present single-differential cross sections in muon and neutral pion momenta, scattering angles with respect to the beam for the outgoing muon and neutral pion, as well as the opening angle between the muon and neutral pion. Data extracted cross sections are compared to generator predictions. We report good agreement between the data and the models for scattering angles, except for an over-prediction by generators at muon forward angles. Similarly, the agreement between data and the models as a function of momentum is good, except for an underprediction by generators in the medium momentum ranges, $200-400$ MeV for muons and $100-200$ MeV for pions.</description>
