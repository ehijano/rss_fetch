      <title>A direct approach to coherent states of billiards using a quantum algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum billiards are a key focus in quantum mechanics, offering a simple yet powerful model to study complex quantum features. While the development of algebras for quantum systems is traced from one-dimensional integrable models to quantum groups and the Generalized Heisenberg Algebra (GHA). The primary focus of this work is to extend the GHA to quantum billiards, showcasing its application to separable and non-separable billiards. We apply the formalism to a square billiard, first generating one-dimensional coherent states with specific quantum numbers and exploring their time evolution.Then, we extend this approach to develop two-dimensional coherent states for the square billiards. We also demonstrate its applicability in a non-separable equilateral triangle billiard, describing their algebra generators and associated one-dimensional coherent states.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>
