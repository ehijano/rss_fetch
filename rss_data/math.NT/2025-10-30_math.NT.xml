      <title>Adelic Mordell-Lang and the Brauer-Manin obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a closed subvariety of an abelian variety $A$ over a global function field $k$ such that the base change of $A$ to an algebraic closure does not have any positive dimensional isotrivial quotient. We prove that every adelic point on $X$ which is the limit of a sequence of $k$-rational points on $A$ is a limit of $k$-rational points on $X$. Assuming finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $A$, this implies that the rational points on $X$ are dense in the Brauer set of $X$. Similar results are obtained over totally imaginary number fields, conditionally on an adelic Mordell-Lang conjecture.</description>

      <title>Uniform bounds on periodic points of polynomials with good reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish effective bounds on the number of periodic points of degree-$d$ polynomials $\phi$ defined over $p$-adic fields and number fields, under a mild reduction hypothesis that is satisfied by all unicritical polynomials $X^d + c$ with $c$ integral at some prime dividing $d$. As a consequence, we verify the uniform boundedness conjecture for this class of polynomials over number fields $K$, giving the explicit uniform bound $\#\mathrm{Per}_K(\phi) \leq d^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$.</description>

      <title>An alternating sum of the floor function of square roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the alternating sum of the floor function of $\sqrt{jn}$, with $j$ ranging from 1 to $n$, has an easy evaluation for all odd integers $n\geq 1$. This is in contrast to known non-alternating sums of the same type which hold only for a class of primes. The proof is elementary and was suggested by an AI model. To put this result in perspective, we also prove an asymptotic expression for the analogous sum without the floor function.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic big Heegner points over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend Howard's construction of compatible families of Heegner points to the setting of towers of Gross curves and Shimura curves over totally real fields. Following the strategy of Longo and Vigni, our approach simultaneously treats totally definite and indefinite quaternion algebras. We then extend their interpolation methods to define big Heegner points attached to families of Hilbert modular forms of parallel weight under the weak Heegner hypothesis. Applying this construction, we build in the definite setting a totally real analogue of Longo$-$Vigni's two-variable $p$-adic $L$-function, and in the indefinite setting, a system of big Heegner classes in the sense of Howard.</description>

      <title>A Fourier-Jacobi Dirichlet series attached to modular forms of $SO(2,4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Dirichlet series $D_{F,G}(s)$ attached to two modular forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a Poincar\'e series, our main result gives that $D_{F,G}(s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of $n$-universal lattices over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an explicit asymptotic formula for the logarithm of the minimal ranks of $n$-universal lattices over the ring of integers of totally real number fields. We also show that, for any constant $C &gt; 0$ and $n \geq 3$, there are only finitely many totally real fields with an $n$-universal lattice of rank at most $C$, with all such fields being effectively computable. Similarly, for any $n \geq 3$, we show that there are only finitely many totally real fields admitting an $n$-universal criterion set of size at most $C$, with all such fields likewise being effectively computable.</description>

      <title>On a theorem of Rickards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result of Rickards states that the generating series of intersection numbers of real quadratic geodesics on indefinite Shimura curves are elliptic modular forms. We reinterpret this as a Kudla-Millson theta series, and prove that Rickards' generating series is the diagonal restriction of a Hilbert modular form, analogous to results of Darmon-Pozzi-Vonk and Branchereau.</description>

      <title>Wilson's theorem modulo higher prime powers III: The cases modulo $p^6$ and $p^7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending previous work of the author, we compute the Wilson quotient modulo $p^5$ and $p^6$, and equivalently $(p-1)!$ modulo $p^6$ and $p^7$, respectively. Further, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^6$. Subsequently, we discuss some patterns that occur in the $p$-adic coefficients of the Wilson quotient as well as of $(p-1)!$, whereby the original congruence $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ fits perfectly into the theory.</description>

      <title>A note on the tetrahedral index and the Hahn-Exton q-Bessel function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is twofold: First to elucidate some connections between the ``building block'' of Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov's $3$D index, known as the tetrahedral index $I_\Delta (m,e)$, and Hahn--Exton's $q$-analogue of the Bessel function $J_\nu (z;q)$. The correspondence between $I_\Delta$ and $J_\nu$ will allow us to translate useful relations from one setting to the other. Second, we want to introduce to the $q$-hypergeometric community some possibly new techniques, theory and conjectures arising from applications of physical mathematics to geometric topology.</description>

      <title>Integration in finite terms and exponentially algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop techniques at the interface between differential algebra and model theory to study the following problems of exponential algebraicity: Does a given algebraic differential equation admits an exponentially algebraic solution, that is, a holomorphic solution which is definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions? Do solutions of a given list of algebraic differential equations share a nontrivial exponentially algebraic relation, that is, a nontrivial relation definable in the structure of restricted elementary functions?
  These problems can be traced back to the work of Abel and Liouville on the problem of integration in finite terms. This article concerns generalizations of their techniques adapted to the study of exponential transcendence and independence problems for more general systems of differential equations. As concrete applications, we obtain exponential transcendence and independence statements for several classical functions: the error function, the Bessel functions, indefinite integrals of algebraic expressions involving Lambert's W-function, the equation of the pendulum, as well as corresponding decidability results.</description>

Abstract: These are lecture notes for a course in Winter 2022/23, updated and completed in October 2025.
  The goal of the lectures is to present some recent developments around six-functor formalisms, in particular: the abstract theory of 6-functor formalisms; the 2-category of cohomological correspondences, and resulting simplifications in the proofs of Poincar\'e--Verdier duality results; the relation between 6-functor formalisms and ``geometric rings''; many examples of 6-functor formalisms, both old and new.</description>

      <title>Additive structures imply more distances in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances.
  In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if \[ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, \] then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</description>

      <title>Root number bias for newforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously we observed that newforms obey a strict bias towards root number $+1$ in squarefree levels: at least half of the newforms in $S_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ with root number $+1$ for $N$ squarefree, and it is strictly more than half outside of a few special cases. Subsequently, other authors treated levels which are cubes of squarefree numbers. Here we treat arbitrary levels, and find that if the level is not the square of a squarefree number, this strict bias still holds for any weight. In fact the number of such exceptional levels is finite for fixed weight, and 0 if $k &lt; 12$. We also investigate some variants of this question to better understand the exceptional levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce formulas for the logarithms of Drinfeld modules using a framework recently developed by the second author. We write the logarithm function as the evaluation under a motivic map of a product of rigid analytic trivializations of $t$-motives. We then specialize our formulas to express special values of Goss $L$-functions as Drinfeld periods multiplied by rigid analytic trivializations evaluated under this motivic map. We view these formulas as characteristic-$p$ analogues of integral representations of Hasse-Weil type zeta functions. We also apply this machinery for Drinfeld modules tensored with the tensor powers of the Carlitz module, which serves as the Tate twist of a Drinfeld module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we showed that global root numbers of modular forms are biased toward +1. Together with Pharis, we also showed an initial bias of Fourier coefficients towards the sign of the root number. First, we prove analogous results with respect to local root numbers.
  Second, a subtle correlation between Fourier coefficients and global root numbers, termed murmurations, was recently discovered for elliptic curves and modular forms. We conjecture murmurations in a more general context of different (possibly empty) combinations of local root numbers.
  Last, an appendix corrects a sign error in our joint paper with Pharis.</description>

      <title>Wilson's theorem modulo higher prime powers II: Bernoulli numbers and polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By recent work of the author, Wilson's theorem as well as the Wilson quotient can be described by supercongruences of power sums of Fermat quotients modulo every higher prime power. We translate these congruences into congruences of power sums and Bernoulli numbers. This together provides relatively short proofs of the congruences compared to former approaches. As an application, we compute, e.g., the Wilson quotient up to modulo $p^4$ and equivalently the factorial $(p-1)!$ up to modulo $p^5$, which can be extended to any higher prime power with some effort. As a by-product, we determine some power sums of the Fermat quotients up to modulo $p^4$.</description>

      <title>The generic extension map and modular standard modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two classes of $\ell$-modular standard modules of the general linear group. The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the later case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-function of both classes and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</description>

      <title>Wild Brauer classes via prismatic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies, after a finite extension of $K$, the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</description>
