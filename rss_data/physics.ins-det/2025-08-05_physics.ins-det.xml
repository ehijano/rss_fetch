      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>

      <title>HPGe-Compton Net: A Physics-Guided CNN for Fast Gamma Spectra Analysis via Compton Region Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors have been golden standard for gamma spectrometry in Low level radioactive waste (LLW) analysis; however, their notable shortcoming is prolonged measurement durations for weak radioactive waste materials. The present study aimed to develop the HPGe Compton Net, a 1D Physics Guided CNN to accelerate LLW analysis by taking advantage of the entire response function of a HPGe detector for each radionuclide of interest, in contrast to the traditional methods that analyze only peak regions of the response. This acceleration is supported by two core innovative strategies: (a) Channel Prompt method, a feature enhancement incorporating additional physical information to guide the model to locate the designated radionuclide; (b) the specially designed database to achieve effective targeted feature learning. The performance evaluation carried out for test data set showed a five times reduction in measurement time compared to a conventional spectral analysis method while maintaining comparable precision. Compton perturbation tests confirmed the model's smart adaptive utilization of the Compton regions. The generalization testing of four LLW samples as the external validation set proved its superior performance in low count data with an average accuracy of 90% over 83% of the traditional method. Future work will focus on upgrading the HPGe Compton Net for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Calibration of SuperCDMS HVeV Cryogenic Silicon Calorimeters Using Compton Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic calorimeters for low-mass dark matter searches have achieved sub-eV energy resolutions, driving advances in both low-energy calibration techniques and our understanding of detector physics. The energy deposition spectrum of gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0 V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical photons. The comparison indicates that the detector response at 0 V is about 30% weaker than expected, highlighting challenges in detector response modeling for low-mass dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Object Condensation Clustering for Calorimeter Shower Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several nuclear physics studies using the CLAS12 detector rely on the accurate reconstruction of neutrons and photons from its forward angle calorimeter system. These studies often place restrictive cuts when measuring neutral particles due to an overabundance of false clusters created by the existing calorimeter reconstruction software. In this work, we present a new AI approach to clustering CLAS12 calorimeter hits based on the object condensation framework. The model learns a latent representation of the full detector topology using GravNet layers, serving as the positional encoding for an event's calorimeter hits which are processed by a Transformer encoder. This unique structure allows the model to contextualize local and long range information, improving its performance. Evaluated on one million simulated $e+p$ collision events, our method significantly improves cluster trustworthiness: the fraction of reliable neutron clusters, increasing from 8.98\% to 30.65\%, and photon clusters, increasing from 51.10\% to 63.64\%. Our study also marks the first application of AI clustering techniques for hodoscopic detectors, showing potential for usage in many other experiments.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <title>Mechanical strength investigations of the APPLE-X undulator using Fiber Bragg Grating strain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.</description>
