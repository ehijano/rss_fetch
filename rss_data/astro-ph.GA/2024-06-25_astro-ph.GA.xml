      <title>Early Galaxies and Early Dark Energy: A Unified Solution to the Hubble Tension and Puzzles of Massive Bright Galaxies revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of ultra-violet (UV)-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ and possibly overly massive galaxies at $z\gtrsim 7$, challenging standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use an empirical galaxy formation model to explore the potential of alleviating these tensions through an Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, originally proposed to solve the Hubble tension. Our benchmark model demonstrates excellent agreement with the UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) at $4\lesssim z \lesssim10$ in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. In the EDE cosmology, the UVLF measurements at $z\simeq 12$ based on spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit no tension with the benchmark model. Photometric constraints at $12 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$ can be fully explained within EDE via either moderately increased star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon_{\ast}\sim 3-10\%$ at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) or enhanced UV variabilities ($\sigma_{\rm UV}\sim 0.8-1.3$ mag at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) that are within the scatter of hydrodynamical simulation predictions. A similar agreement is difficult to achieve in $\Lambda$CDM, especially at $z\gtrsim 14$, where the required $\sigma_{\rm UV}$ exceeds the maximum value seen in simulations. Furthermore, the implausibly large cosmic stellar mass densities inferred from some JWST observations are no longer in tension with cosmology when the EDE is considered. Our findings highlight EDE as an intriguing unified solution to a fundamental problem in cosmology and the recent tensions raised by JWST observations. Data at the highest redshifts reached by JWST ($z \sim 14-16$) will be crucial for differentiating modified galaxy formation physics from new cosmological physics.</description>

      <title>When, Where, and How Star Formation Happens in a Galaxy Pair at Cosmic Noon Using CANUCS JWST/NIRISS Grism Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved studies are key to understanding when, where, and how stars form within galaxies. Using slitless grism spectra and broadband imaging from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) we study the spatially resolved properties of a strongly lensed ($\mu$ = 5.4$\pm$1.8) z = 0.8718 galaxy pair consisting of a blue face-on galaxy (10.2 $\pm$ 0.2 log($M/M_\odot$)) with multiple star-forming clumps and a dusty red edge-on galaxy (9.9 $\pm$ 0.3 log($M/M_\odot$)). We produce accurate H$\alpha$ maps from JWST/NIRISS grism data using a new methodology that accurately models spatially varying continuum and emission line strengths. With spatially resolved indicators, we probe star formation on timescales of $\sim$ 10 Myr (NIRISS H$\alpha$ emission line maps) and $\sim$ 100 Myr (UV imaging and broadband SED fits). Taking the ratio of the H$\alpha$ to UV flux ($\eta$), we measure spatially resolved star formation burstiness. We find that in the face-on galaxy both H$\alpha$ and broadband star formation rates (SFRs) drop at large galactocentric radii by a factor of $\sim$ 4.7 and 3.8 respectively, while SFR over the last $\sim$ 100 Myrs has increased by a factor of 1.6. Additionally, of the 20 clumps identified in the galaxy pair we find that 7 are experiencing bursty star formation, while 10 clumps are quenching and 3 are in equilibrium (either being in a state of steady star formation or post-burst). Our analysis reveals that the blue face-on galaxy disk is predominantly in a quenching or equilibrium phase. However, the most intense quenching within the galaxy is seen in the quenching clumps. This pilot study demonstrates what JWST/NIRISS data can reveal about spatially varying star formation in galaxies at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the dynamical states of galaxy clusters using PCA and UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous metrics exist to quantify the dynamical state of galaxy clusters, both observationally and within simulations. Many of these correlate strongly with one another, but it is not clear whether all of these measures probe the same intrinsic properties. In this work, we use two different statistical approaches -- principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) -- to investigate which dynamical properties of a cluster are in fact the best descriptors of its dynamical state. We use measurements taken directly from The Three Hundred suite of galaxy cluster simulations, as well as morphological properties calculated using mock X-ray and SZ maps of the same simulated clusters. We find that four descriptions of dynamical state naturally arise, and although correlations exist between these, a given cluster can be "dynamically relaxed" according to all, none, or some of these four descriptions. These results demonstrate that it is highly important for future observational and theoretical studies to consider in which sense clusters are dynamically relaxed. Cluster dynamical states are complex and multi-dimensional, and so it is not meaningful to classify them simply as "relaxed" and "unrelaxed" based on a single linear scale.</description>

      <title>Analysis of regularity/chaoticity of the globular clusters dynamics on the central region of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the regularity/chaoticity of the orbits of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence from an elongated rotating bar. Various analysis methods were used, namely, methods for calculating the Highest Lyapunov Exponents, the method of Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, the frequency method based on the calculation of fundamental frequencies, as well as the visual assessment method. Bimodality was discovered in the histogram of the distribution of positive Lyapunov exponents, calculated in the classical version, without renormalization of the shadow orbit, which makes it possible to implement a probabilistic method of GC classification. To construct the orbits of globular clusters, we used a gravitational potential model with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid, described in detail in the work of Bajkova et al., Izvestiya Glavnoi astronomicheskoi observatorii v Pulkove, {\bf 228}, 1 (2023). The following bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot $, semimajor axis length 5 kpc, bar viewing angle 25$^o$, rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. To form the 6D-phase space required for orbit integration, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3) (Vasiliev, Baumgardt, 2021), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters (Baumgardt, Vasiliev, 2021) were used. A classification is made of globular clusters with regular and chaotic dynamics. As the analysis showed, globular clusters with small pericentric distances and large eccentricities are most susceptible to the influence of the bar and demonstrate the greatest chaos. It is shown that the results of classifying globular clusters by the nature of their orbital dynamics, obtained using the various methods of analysis considered in the work, correlate well with each other.</description>

      <title>ALMA follow-up of $\sim$ 3,000 red-Herschel galaxies: the nature of extreme submillimeter galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of over 3,000 red-$Herschel$ sources ($S_{\mathrm{250\mu m}}&lt;S_{\mathrm{350\mu m}}&lt;S_{\mathrm{500\mu m} }$) using public data from the ALMA archive and the $Herschel$-ATLAS survey. This represents the largest sample of red-$Herschel$ sources with interferometric follow-up observations to date. The high ALMA angular resolution and sensitivity ($\theta_{\rm FWHM}\sim$1 arcsecond; $\sigma_{1.3\mathrm{mm}}\sim0.17$ mJy beam$^{-1}$) allow us to classify the sample into individual sources, multiple systems, and potential lenses and/or close mergers. Interestingly, even at this high angular resolution, 73 per cent of our detections are single systems, suggesting that most of these galaxies are isolated and/or post-merger galaxies. For the remaining detections, 20 per cent are classified as multiple systems, 5 per cent as lenses and/or mergers, and 2 per cent as low-$z$ galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei. Combining the $Herschel$/SPIRE and ALMA photometry, these galaxies are found to be extreme and massive systems with a median star formation rate of $\sim$ 1,500 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$ and molecular gas mass of $M_{\mathrm{gas}}\sim10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The median redshift of individual sources is $z\approx2.8$, while the likely lensed systems are at $z\approx3.3$, with redshift distributions extending to $z\sim6$. The inferred depletion times are consistent with the starburst-type population with a mild redshift evolution. Our results suggest a common star-formation mode for extreme galaxies across cosmic time, likely triggered by close interactions or disk-instabilities. Moreover, all galaxies with $S_{\mathrm{1.3mm}}\geq13$ mJy are gravitationally amplified which, similar to the established $S_{500\mathrm{ \mu m}}&gt;100$ mJy threshold, can be used as a simple criterion to identify gravitationally lensed galaxies.</description>

      <title>Populating Galaxies Into Halos Via Machine Learning on the Simba Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present machine learning (ML)-based pipelines designed to populate galaxies into dark matter halos from N-body simulations. These pipelines predict galaxy stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), atomic and molecular gas contents, and metallicities, and can be easily extended to other galaxy properties and simulations. Our approach begins by categorizing galaxies into central and satellite classifications, followed by their ML classification into quenched (Q) and star-forming (SF) galaxies. We then develop regressors specifically for the SF galaxies within both central and satellite subgroups. We train the model on the $(100\mathrm{h^{-1}Mpc})^3$ Simba galaxy formation simulation at $z=0$. Our pipeline yields robust predictions for stellar mass and metallicity and offers significant improvements for SFR and gas properties compared to previous works, achieving an unbiased scatter of less than 0.2 dex around true Simba values for the halo-$M_{\rm HI}$ relation of central galaxies. We also show the effectiveness of the ML-based pipelines at $z=1,2$. Interestingly, we find that training on fraction-based properties (e.g. $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{*}$) and then multiplying by the ML-predicted $M_{*}$ yields improved predictions versus directly training on the property value, for many quantities across redshifts. However, we find that the ML-predicted scatter around the mean is lower than the true scatter, leading to artificially suppressed distribution functions at high values. To alleviate this, we add a "ML scatter bias", finely tuned to recover the true distribution functions, critical for accurate predictions of integrated quantities such as $\rm{HI}$ intensity maps.</description>

      <title>The fate of the interstellar medium in early-type galaxies. IV. The impact of stellar feedback, mergers, and black holes on the cold ISM in simulated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing cold interstellar medium (ISM) from a galaxy is central to quenching star formation. However, the exact mechanism of this process remains unclear. The objective of this work is to find the mechanism responsible for dust and gas removal in simulated early-type galaxies (ETGs). A statistically significant sample of massive (M_*&gt;$10^{10}$M$_\odot$), simulated ETG in a redshift range of 0.02--0.32 is studied in the context of its ISM properties. In particular, we investigate the cold dust and gas removal timescales, the cold gas inflows, and their relation with black hole (BH) mass. We also investigate the evolution of galaxies in the dust vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane and the influence of merger events. We find agreement with previous observational works considering the timescales of dust and HI removal from ETGs. When considering the dust-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of time in simulations, we recovered a similar decline as in the observational sample as a function of stellar age, validating its use for timing the ISM decline. Moreover, we recover the observed relation between dust mass and SFR for actively star-forming galaxies as well as for passive ETGs. We also show that starburst galaxies form their own sequence on the dust vs. SFR plot in a form $\log(M_{\rm dust, SB})= 0.913\times \log({\rm SFR}) + 6.533$ with $2\sigma$ scatter of 0.32. Finally, we find that type II supernova reverse shocks dominate the dust destruction at the early stages of ETG evolution, while at later times stellar feedback becomes more important. We show that merger events lead to morphological transformations by increasing the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio followed by an increase in BH masses. The BH feedback resulting from radio mode accretion prevents the hot halo gas from cooling, indirectly leading to a decrease in the SFR.</description>

      <title>Survey of extended Main Sequence Turn-offs in Galactic Open Clusters: Stellar rotations from Gaia RVS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTO) in star clusters younger than 2 Gyr still challenges our current understanding of stellar evolution. Exploiting data from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we investigate eMSTOs in a large sample of 32 Galactic open clusters younger than 2.4 Gyr. We first validate Gaia rotational velocities from Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra by comparing them with literature values and assessing their correlation with magnetic activity measurements from LAMOST spectra. We detect a general positive correlation between turn-off color and projected stellar rotation, with slow-rotating stars predominantly found on the bluer side of the turn-off. Comparing our observations with theoretical models, we find that the eMSTO morphology is well-reproduced by a single population formed with a high rotation rate, and observed with rotation axis inclination ranging between 0$^\circ$ (pole-on) and 90$^\circ$ (edge-on). This contrasts with observations of Magellanic Clouds clusters, where a population of non-rotating stars appears to be ubiquitous in clusters younger than 700 Myr. However, we note that our interpretation, while successfully explaining the overall eMSTO morphology, cannot fully explain the observed projected rotational velocities. Additionally, two young clusters, NGC 3532 and NGC 2287, exhibit moderate evidence of a split main sequence in color and rotation, suggesting a possible small spread in the initial rotation rate. Finally, we advise caution in determining the ages of young clusters from non-rotating isochrones, as neglecting the effects of stellar rotation can impact the isochrone dating by up to factors of 5-20%.</description>

      <title>Mapping Multi-Phase Metals in Star-forming Galaxies: a spatially resolved UV + Optical Study of NGC 5253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pioneering spatially-resolved, multi-phase gas abundance study on the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC~5253, targeting 10 star-forming (SF) clusters inside six FUV HST/COS pointings with co-spatial optical VLT/MUSE observations throughout the galaxy. The SF regions span a wide range of ages (1--15 Myr) and are distributed at different radii (50 -- 230 pc). We performed robust absorption-line profile fitting on the COS spectra, covering 1065--1430 \AA\ in the FUV, allowing an accurate computation of neutral-gas abundances for 13 different ions sampling 8 elements. These values were then compared with the ionized-gas abundances, measured using the direct method on MUSE integrated spectra inside analog COS apertures. Our multi-phase, spatially resolved comparisons find abundances which are lower in the neutral gas than the ionized gas by 0.22 dex, 0.80 dex and 0.58 dex for log(O/H), log(N/H) and log(N/O), respectively. We modeled the chemical abundance distributions and evaluated correlations as a function of radius and age. It was found that while N, O and N/O abundances decrease as a function of age in the ionized gas, they increase with age in the neutral gas. No strong correlations for N, O or N/O were observed as a function of radius. The N/O and N/H offsets between the phases were found to decrease with age, providing evidence that chemical enrichment happens differentially, first in the ionized-gas phase around 2--5 Myrs (due to N-rich Wolf-Rayet stars) and then mixing out into the cold neutral gas on longer timescales of 10--15 Myr.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Evolution of the Hot Gas in Normal Galaxies from the Near Universe to z=0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the ~107 degree hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z &lt; 0.6 detected in five high galactic latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ~400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit co-moving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (~5s) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6-10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS~1041 erg s-1 galaxies at higher z, suggests that high z, moderate LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without AGN feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent SFR.</description>

      <title>A 100 Mpc$^2$ structure traced by hyperluminous galaxies around a massive $z$ = 2.85 protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present wide-field mapping at 850 $\mu$m and 450 $\mu$m of the $z$ = 2.85 protocluster in the HS1549$+$19 field using the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2). Spectroscopic follow-up of 18 bright sources selected at 850 $\mu$m, using the Nothern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), confirms the majority lies near $z$ $\sim$ 2.85 and are likely members of the structure. Interpreting the spectroscopic redshifts as distance measurements, we find that the SMGs span 90 Mpc$^2$ in the plane of the sky and demarcate a 4100 Mpc$^3$ "pancake"-shaped structure in three dimensions. We find that the high star-formation rates (SFRs) of these SMGs result in a total SFR of 20,000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ only from the brightest galaxies in the protocluster. These rapidly star-forming SMGs can be interpreted as massive galaxies growing rapidly at large cluster-centric distances before collapsing into a virialized structure. We find that the SMGs trace the Lyman-$\alpha$ surface density profile. Comparison with simulations suggests that HS1549$+$19 could be building a structure comparable to the most massive clusters in the present-day Universe.</description>

Abstract: The ESO public survey VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) surveyed the inner Galactic bulge and the adjacent southern Galactic disk from $2009-2015$. Upon its conclusion, the complementary VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey has expanded both the temporal as well as spatial coverage of the original VVV area, widening it from $562$ to $1700$ sq. deg., as well as providing additional epochs in $JHK_{\rm s}$ filters from $2016-2023$. With the completion of VVVX observations during the first semester of 2023, we present here the observing strategy, a description of data quality and access, and the legacy of VVVX. VVVX took $\sim 2000$ hours, covering about 4% of the sky in the bulge and southern disk. VVVX covered most of the gaps left between the VVV and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) areas and extended the VVV time baseline in the obscured regions affected by high extinction and hence hidden from optical observations. VVVX provides a deep $JHK_{\rm s}$ catalogue of $\gtrsim 1.5\times10^9$ point sources, as well as a $K_{\rm s}$ band catalogue of $\sim 10^7$ variable sources. Within the existing VVV area, we produced a $5D$ map of the surveyed region by combining positions, distances, and proper motions of well-understood distance indicators such as red clump stars, RR Lyrae, and Cepheid variables. In March 2023 we successfully finished the VVVX survey observations that started in 2016, an accomplishment for ESO Paranal Observatory upon 4200 hours of observations for VVV+VVVX. The VVV+VVVX catalogues complement those from the Gaia mission at low Galactic latitudes and provide spectroscopic targets for the forthcoming ESO high-multiplex spectrographs MOONS and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Exploring Simple-Population and Multiple-Population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs) that consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using the ChM have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on highprecision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately $10^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W - F814W color spreads corresponding to [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05 - 0.30 dex. This indicates that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.</description>

      <title>CONCERTO at APEX -- On-sky performance in continuum</title>

Abstract: We present the data-processing algorithms and the performance of CONCERTO (CarbON CII line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch) in continuum by analysing the data from the commissioning and scientific observations. The beam pattern is characterized by an effective FWHM of 31.9 $\pm$ 0.6" and 34.4 $\pm$ 1.0" for high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands. The main beam is slightly elongated with a mean eccentricity of 0.46. Two error beams of $\sim$65" and $\sim$130" are characterized, enabling the estimate of a main beam efficiency of $\sim$0.52. The field of view is accurately reconstructed and presents coherent distortions between the HF and LF arrays. LEKID parameters were robustly determined for 80% of the read tones. Cross-talks between LEKIDs are the first cause of flagging, followed by an excess of eccentricity for $\sim$10% of the LEKIDs, all located in a given region of the field of view. On the 44 scans of Uranus selected for the absolute photometric calibration, 72.5% and 78.2% of the LEKIDs are selected as valid detectors with a probability &gt;70%. By comparing Uranus measurements with a model, we obtain calibration factors of 19.5$\pm$0.6 [Hz/Jy] and 25.6$\pm$0.9 [Hz/Jy] for HF and LF. The point-source continuum measurement uncertainties are 3.0% and 3.4% for HF and LF bands. The RMS of CONCERTO maps is verified to evolve as proportional to the inverse square root of integration time. The measured NEFDs for HF and LF are 115$\pm$2 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$ and 95$\pm$1 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$, obtained using CONCERTO data on the COSMOS field for a mean precipitable water vapour and elevation of 0.81 mm and 55.7 deg. CONCERTO demonstrates unique capabilities in fast dual-band spectral mapping with a $\sim$18.5' instantaneous field-of-view. CONCERTO's performance in continuum is perfectly in line with expectations.</description>

      <title>Compaction during fragmentation and bouncing produces realistic dust grain porosities in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: In protoplanetary discs, micron-sized dust grows to form millimetre- to centimetre-sized pebbles but encounters several barriers during its evolution. Collisional fragmentation and radial drift impede further dust growth to planetesimal size. Fluffy grains have been hypothesised to solve these problems. While porosity leads to faster grain growth, the implied porosity values obtained from previous simulations were larger than suggested by observations. Aims: In this paper, we study the influence of porosity on dust evolution taking into account growth, bouncing, fragmentation, compaction, rotational disruption and snow lines, in order to understand their impact on dust evolution. Methods: We develop a module for porosity evolution for the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom that accounts for dust growth and fragmentation. This mono-disperse model is integrated into both a 1D code and the 3D code to capture the overall evolution of dust and gas. Results: We show that porosity helps dust growth and leads to the formation of larger solids than when considering compact grains, as predicted by previous work. Our simulations taking into account compaction during fragmentation show that large millimetre grains are still formed, but are 10 to 100 times more compact. Thus, mm sizes with typical filling factors of ~0.1 match the values measured on comets or via polarimetric observations of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an alternative to the Monte Carlo method for dust continuous radiative transfer simulations: the Quasi-Monte Carlo method. We briefly discuss what it is, its history, and possible implementations. We compare the Monte Carlo method with four pseudo-random number generators and five Quasi-Monte Carlo implementations using different low-discrepancy sequences and the Hammersley set. For the comparison, we study different test matter geometries and problems. We present comparison results for single scatterings of radiation from a point source, multiple scatterings of radiation from a point source, and single scatterings of radiation from a spherical star. In all cases, Quasi-Monte Carlo shows better convergence than Monte Carlo. In several test cases, the gain in computation time to achieve a fixed error value reached 40 times. We obtained ten times speed up in many of the considered tests.</description>

      <title>Multiple misaligned outflows and warped accretion flows in the proto-multiple system Per-emb-8 and 55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the formation process of multiple systems, we have analyzed the ALMA archival data of the 1.3 mm continuum, $^{12}$CO (2-1) and C$^{18}$O (2-1) emission in a proto-multiple system consisting of a Class 0 protostar Per-emb-8 and a Class I protobinary Per-emb-55 $A$ and $B$. The 1.3 mm continuum emission is likely to primarily trace their protostellar disks, and the Keplerian disk rotation is observed in Per-emb-8 and Per-emb-55 $A$ in the emission lines. In Per-emb-8, we identify two arm-like structures with a length of $\sim$ 1000 au connecting the eastern and western of its disk in the continuum and C$^{18}$O emission. Our analysis suggests that these arm-like structures are most likely infalling flows. In the $^{12}$CO emission, we discover a second bipolar outflow associated with Per-emb-8. The two bipolar outflows in Per-emb-8 are possibly launched along the normal axes of the misaligned inner and outer parts of its warped protostellar disk. In Per-emb-55, we find that the red- and blueshifted lobes of its bipolar outflow are misaligned by 90$^\circ$. The presence of the warped disk, multiple misaligned outflows, and asymmetric infalling flows suggest complex dynamics in proto-multiple systems, and these could be related to the tidal interactions between the companions and/or the turbulent environments forming this proto-multiple system.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: The fraction of calcium white dwarfs along the cooling sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR2 photometry in twelve optical bands over 2176 deg2 to estimate the fraction of white dwarfs with presence of CaII H+K absorption along the cooling sequence. We compared the J-PLUS photometry against metal-free theoretical models to estimate the equivalent width in the J0395 passband of 10 nm centered at 395 nm (EW_J0395), a proxy to detect calcium absorption. A total of 4399 white dwarfs within 30000 &gt; Teff &gt; 5500 K and mass M &gt; 0.45 Msun were analyzed. Their EW_J0395 distribution was modeled using two populations, corresponding to polluted and non-polluted systems, to estimate the fraction of calcium white dwarfs (f_Ca) as a function of Teff. The probability for each individual white dwarf of presenting calcium absorption, pca, was also computed. The comparison with both the measured Ca/He abundance and the metal pollution from spectroscopy shows that EW_J0395 correlates with the presence of calcium. The fraction of calcium white dwarfs increases from f_Ca = 0 at Teff = 13500 K to f_Ca = 0.15 at Teff = 5500 K. We compare our results with the fractions derived from the 40 pc spectroscopic sample and from SDSS spectra. The trend found in J-PLUS observations is also present in the 40 pc sample, however SDSS shows a deficit of metal-polluted objects at Teff &lt; 12000 K. Finally, we found 39 white dwarfs with pca &gt; 0.99. Twenty of them have spectra presented in previous studies, whereas we observed six additional targets. These 26 objects were all confirmed as metal-polluted systems. The J-PLUS optical data provide a robust statistical measurement for the presence of CaII H+K absorption in white dwarfs. We find a 15 +- 3 % increase in the fraction of calcium white dwarfs from Teff = 13500 K to 5500 K, which reflects their selection function in the optical from the total population of metal-polluted systems.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Integrated Study of X-ray Spectrum and Time Lags for HBL Mrk 421 within the Framework of the Multiple-Zone Leptonic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the timing analysis of 10 archived \XMM observations with an exposure of $&gt;40$ ks of Markarian 421. Mrk 421 is the brightest high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object (HBL) emitting in X-rays produced by electrons accelerated in the innermost regions of a relativistic jet pointing toward us. For each observation, we construct averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5--10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned light curves (LCs) in various subbands. During these observations, the source exhibited various intensity states differing by close to an order of magnitude in flux, with the fractional variability amplitude increasing with energy through the X-ray band. Bayesian power spectral density analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterized by a colored noise, with an index ranging from $\sim-1.9$ to $-3.0$. Moreover, both the standard cross-correlation function and cross-spectral methods indicate that the amount of time lags increases with the energy difference between two compared LCs. A time-dependent two-zone jet model is developed to extract physical information from the X-ray emission of Mrk 421. In the model, we assume that the jet emission mostly comprises a quasi-stationary component and a highly variable one. Our results show that the two-zone model can simultaneously provide a satisfactory description for both the X-ray spectra and time lags observed in different epochs, with the model parameters constrained in a fully acceptable interval. We suggest that shocks within the jets may be the primary energy dissipation process responsible for triggering the rapid variability, although magnetic reconnection cannot be excluded.</description>

Caselli &amp; Th. Henning). Our sample consists of Class II disks with no evidence of strong radial substructures. We use thesedata to constrain the thermal and chemical structure of these disks through theoretical models for gas emission. To fit the combined optically thick and thin CO line data in Fourier space, we developed the DiskCheF code, which includes the parameterized disk physical structure, machine-learning (ML) accelerated chemistry, and the RADMC-3D line radiative transfer module. A key novelty of DiskCheF is the fast and feasible ML-based chemistry trained on the extended grid of the disk physical-chemical models precomputed with the ANDES2 code. This ML approach allows complex chemical kinetics models to be included in a time-consuming disk fitting without the need to run a chemical code. We present a novel approach to incorporate chemistry into disk modeling without the need to explicitly calculate a chemical network every time. Using this new disk modeling tool, we successfully fit the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) data from the CI, CY, DL, DM, DN, and IQ Tau disks. The combination of optically thin and optically thick CO lines allows us to simultaneously constrain the disk temperature and mass distribution, and derive the CO-based gas masses. These values are in reasonable agreement with the disk dust masses rescaled by a factor of 100 as well as with other indirect gas measurements.</description>

Abstract: Stellar winds form an integral part of astronomy. The solar wind affects Earth's magnetosphere, while the winds of hot massive stars are highly relevant for galactic feedback through their mechanical wind energy. In different parts of the stellar HR diagram different forces dominate. On the hot side of the HRD radiative forces on ionised gas particles are active, while on the cool side molecular and dust opacities take over. Moreover, due to the convective envelopes, alternative physical ingredients may start to dominate. I will describe the basic equation of motion and give a few examples, mostly focusing on the winds from massive stars. Here mass-loss rates significantly affect the stellar evolution all the way to core collapse as a supernova and/or black hole formation event.</description>

      <title>Projection factor and radii of Type II Cepheids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids are old pulsating stars that can be used to trace the distribution of an old stellar population and to measure distances to globular clusters and galaxies within several megaparsecs. One method that can be used to measure the distances of Type II Cepheids relies on period-luminosity relations, which are quite widely explored in the literature. The semi-geometrical Baade-Wesselink technique is another method that allows distances of radially pulsating stars, such as Type II Cepheids, to be measured if the so-called projection factor is known. Using the surface brightness-colour relation version of the Baade-Wesselink technique, we determined the projection factors and radii of eight nearby BL Her type stars. We adopted accurate distances of target stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Time series photometry in the V and K bands have been collected with two telescopes located at the Rolf Chini Cerro Murphy Observatory, while spectroscopic data have been obtained with instruments hosted by the European Southern Observatory. The measured projection factors for the stars with good quality data are in the range between 1.21 and 1.36. The typical uncertainty of projection factors is 0.1. The mean value is 1.330$\pm$0.058, which gives the uncertainty of $\sim$4%. The main sources of uncertainty on the p-factors are statistical errors of the Baade-Wesselink fit and parallax. In the case of radii, the biggest contribution to the error budget comes from the K band photometry systematic uncertainty and parallax. The determined radii allowed us to construct the period-radius relation for BL Her stars. Our period-radius relation is in good agreement with the previous empirical calibration, while two theoretical calibrations found in the literature agree with our relation within 2$\sigma$. We also confirm that BL Her and RR Lyr stars obey an apparent common period-radius relation.</description>

      <title>North-PHASE: Studying Periodicity, Hot Spots, Accretion Stability and Early Evolution in young stars in the northern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the overview and first results from the North-PHASE Legacy Survey, which follows six young clusters for five years, using the 2 deg$^2$ FoV of the JAST80 telescope from the Javalambre Observatory (Spain). North-PHASE investigates stellar variability on timescales from days to years for thousands of young stars distributed over entire clusters. This allows us to find new YSO, characterise accretion and study inner disk evolution within the cluster context. Each region (Tr37, CepOB3, IC5070, IC348, NGC2264, and NGC1333) is observed in six filters (SDSS griz, u band, and J0660, which covers H$\alpha$), detecting cluster members as well as field variable stars. Tr37 is used to prove feasibility and optimise the variability analysis techniques. In Tr37, variability reveals 50 new YSO, most of them proper motion outliers. North-PHASE independently confirms the youth of astrometric members, efficiently distinguishes accreting and non-accreting stars, reveals the extent of the cluster populations along Tr37/IC1396 bright rims, and detects variability resulting from rotation, dips, and irregular bursts. The proper motion outliers unveil a more complex star formation history than inferred from Gaia alone, and variability highlights previously hidden proper motion deviations in the surrounding clouds. We also find that non-YSO variables identified by North-PHASE cover a different variability parameter space and include long-period variables, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyr, and $\delta$ Scuti stars. These early results also emphasize the power of variability to complete the picture of star formation where it is missed by astrometry.</description>

      <title>The host of GRB 171205A in 3D -- A resolved multiwavelength study of a rare grand-design spiral GRB host</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long GRB hosts at z&lt;1 are usually low-mass, low metallicity star-forming galaxies. Here we present the until now most detailed, spatially resolved study of the host of GRB 171205A, a grand-design barred spiral galaxy at z=0.036. Our analysis includes MUSE integral field spectroscopy, complemented by high spatial resolution UV/VIS HST imaging and CO(1-0) and HI 21cm data. The GRB is located in a small star-forming region in a spiral arm of the galaxy at a deprojected distance of ~ 8 kpc from the center. The galaxy shows a smooth negative metallicity gradient and the metallicity at the GRB site is half solar, slightly below the mean metallicity at the corresponding distance from the center. Star formation in this galaxy is concentrated in a few HII regions between 5-7 kpc from the center and at the end of the bar, inwards of the GRB region, however, the HII region hosting the GRB is in the top 10% of regions with highest specific star-formation rate. The stellar population at the GRB site has a very young component (&lt; 5 Myr) contributing a significant part of the light. Ionized and molecular gas show only minor deviations at the end of the bar. A parallel study found an asymmetric HI distribution and some additional gas near the position of the GRB, which might explain the star-forming region of the GRB site. Our study shows that long GRBs can occur in many types of star-forming galaxies, however, the actual GRB sites consistently have low metallicity, high star formation and a young population. Furthermore, gas inflow or interactions triggering the star formation producing the GRB progenitor might not be evident in ionized or even molecular gas but only in HI.</description>

      <title>HI and CO spectroscopy of the unusual host of GRB 171205A: A grand design spiral galaxy with a distorted HI field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRBs produced by the collapse of massive stars are usually found near the most prominent star-forming regions of star-forming galaxies. GRB 171205A happened in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy, a peculiar location in an atypical GRB host. In this paper we present a highly-resolved study of the molecular gas of this host, with CO(1-0) observations from ALMA. We compare with GMRT atomic HI observations, and with data at other wavelengths to provide a broad-band view of the galaxy. The ALMA observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 10 km/s, observed when the afterglow had a flux density of ~53 mJy. This allowed a molecular study both in emission and absorption. The HI observations allowed to study the host galaxy and its extended environment. The CO emission shows an undisturbed spiral structure with a central bar, and no significant emission at the location of the GRB. Our CO spectrum does not reveal any CO absorption, with a column density limit of &lt; 10^15 cm^-2. This argues against the progenitor forming in a massive molecular cloud. The molecular gas traces the galaxy arms with higher concentration in the regions dominated by dust. The HI gas does not follow the stellar light or the molecular gas and is concentrated in two blobs, with no emission towards the centre of the galaxy, and is slightly displaced towards the southwest of the galaxy, where the GRB exploded. Within the extended neighbourhood of the host galaxy, we identify another prominent HI source at the same redshift, at a projected distance of 188 kpc. Our observations show that the progenitor of this GRB is not associated to a massive molecular cloud, but more likely related to low-metallicity atomic gas. The distortion in the HI gas field is indicator of an odd environment that could have triggered star formation and could be linked to a past interaction with the companion galaxy.</description>

      <title>Determining star-formation rates in Active Galactic Nuclei hosts via stellar population synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the host galaxy, and its role in quenching or enhancing star-formation, is still uncertain due to the fact that usual star-formation rate (SFR) indicators -- emission-line luminosities based on the assumption of photoionisation by young stars -- cannot be used for active galaxies as the ionising source is the AGN. We thus investigate the use of SFR derived from the stellar population and its relation with that derived from the gas for a sample of 170 AGN hosts and a matched control sample of 291 galaxies. We compare the values of SFR densities obtained via the Ha emission line (SFRg) for regions ionised by hot stars according to diagnostic diagrams with those obtained from stellar population synthesis (SFRstars) over the last 1 to 100~Myr. We find that the SFRstars over the last 20~Myrs closely reproduces the SFRg, although a better match is obtained via the transformation: log(SFRstars) = (0.870+/-0.004) log(SFRg) +(0.007+/-0.006), which is valid for both AGN hosts and non-active galaxies. We also compare the reddening obtained via the gas Ha/Hb ratio with that derived via the full spectral fitting in the stellar population synthesis. We find that the ratio between the gas and stellar extinction is in the range 2.64 &lt; A_Vgas/A_Vstar} &lt; 2.85, in approximate agreement with previous results from the literature, obtained for smaller samples. We interpret the difference as being due to the fact that the reddening of the stars is dominated by that affecting the less obscured underlying older population, while the reddening of the gas is larger as it is associated to a younger stellar population buried deeper in the dust.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in the centers of galaxies: synergy between stellar flybys and tidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic centers are very dynamically active environments, often harbouring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the galactic center and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster's tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ~10-30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of $j_z$ driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ~10-100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase-space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in galaxy centers by promoting the tidal field-driven eccentricity excitation.</description>

      <title>Measuring the conditional luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies by combining the DESI LS DR9, SV3 and Y1 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this investigation, we leverage the combination of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy imaging Surveys Data Release 9 (DESI LS DR9), Survey Validation 3 (SV3), and Year 1 (Y1) data sets to estimate the conditional luminosity and stellar mass functions (CLFs &amp; CSMFs) of galaxies across various halo mass bins and redshift ranges. To support our analysis, we utilize a realistic DESI Mock Galaxy Redshift Survey (MGRS) generated from a high-resolution Jiutian simulation. An extended halo-based group finder is applied to both MGRS catalogs and DESI observation. By comparing the r and z-band luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) derived using both photometric and spectroscopic data, we quantified the impact of photometric redshift (photo-z) errors on the galaxy LFs and SMFs, especially in the low redshift bin at low luminosity/mass end. By conducting prior evaluations of the group finder using MGRS, we successfully obtain a set of CLF and CSMF measurements from observational data. We find that at low redshift the faint end slopes of CLFs and CSMFs below $10^{9}h^{-2}L_{\odot}$ (or $h^{-2}M_{\odot}$) evince a compelling concordance with the subhalo mass functions. After correcting the cosmic variance effect of our local Universe following arXiv:1809.00523, the faint end slopes of the LFs/SMFs turn out to be also in good agreement with the slope of the halo mass function.</description>

      <title>Action and energy clustering of stellar streams in deforming Milky Way dark matter haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the spherical MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the spherical mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.</description>

      <title>Linear operator theory of phase mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) in a functional Koopman representation. This facilitates the use of linear spectral techniques characteristic of the analysis of Schrodinger-type equations. For illustrative purposes, we consider the classical phase mixing of a non-interacting distribution function in a quartic potential. Solutions are determined perturbatively relative to a harmonic oscillator. We impose a form of coarse-graining by choosing a finite dimensional basis to represent the distribution function and time evolution operators, which sets a minimum length scale on phase space structure. We observe a relationship between the dimension of the representation and the multiplicity of the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues. System dynamics are understood in terms of degenerate subspaces of the linear operator spectra. Each subspace is associated with a mode of the harmonic oscillator, the first two being bending and breathing structures. The quartic potential splits the degenerate eigenvalues within each subspace. This facilitates the formation of spiral structure as deformations from the harmonic oscillator modes. We ultimately argue that this construction provides a promising avenue for study of self-interacting systems experiencing phase mixing, which is an outstanding problem in the context of the Gaia DR2 vertical phase space spirals.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, the Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 yr, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light-curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and they demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Search and analysis of giant radio galaxies with associated nuclei (SAGAN) IV. Interplay with the Supercluster environment</title>

Abstract: We investigated the prevalence of giant radio galaxies (GRGs), some of the largest structures powered by supermassive black holes, within supercluster environments, and the influence of such environments on their properties. Utilising two large catalogues of superclusters (401) and GRGs (1446), we established the existence of 77 GRGs (5.3%) residing in 64 superclusters (16%) within $\rm 0.05 \leq z \leq 0.42$. Among the 77 GRGs found in superclusters, we identified $\sim$70% as residing within galaxy clusters. Within the subset of GRGs not located in superclusters, which constitutes 94.7% of the sample, a mere 21% are associated with galaxy clusters, while the remaining majority are situated in sparser environments. We examined the influence of differing environments, such as cluster versus non-cluster and supercluster versus non-supercluster regions, on the size of GRGs, while also exploring the driving factors behind their overall growth. Our findings show that the largest GRGs ($\gtrsim$3 Mpc) grow in underdense environments beyond the confines of dense environments. Moreover, we show that $\sim$ 24% of 1446 GRGs reside in galaxy clusters. We conclude that GRGs preferentially grow in sparser regions of the cosmic web and have a significantly larger median size. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of GRGs as astrophysical probes with specific cases where GRGs, exhibiting polarised emissions and located behind superclusters (acting as natural Faraday screens), were used to estimate magnetic field strengths of the supercluster environment at sub-microgauss levels.</description>

      <title>Effects of Radiative Transfer on the Observed Anisotropy in MHD Turbulent Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anisotropy of centroid and integrated intensity maps with synthetic observations. We perform post-process radiative transfer including the optically thick regime that was not covered in Hern\'andez-Padilla et al. (2020). We consider the emission in various CO molecular lines, that range from optically thin to optically thick ($\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and $\mathrm{C^{17}O}$). The results for the velocity centroids are similar to those in the optically thin case. For instance, the anisotropy observed can be attributed to the Alfv\'en mode, which dominates over the slow and fast modes when the line of sight is at a high inclination with respect to the mean magnetic field. A few differences arise in the models with higher opacity, where some dependence on the sonic Mach number becomes evident. In contrast to the optically thin case, maps of integrated intensity become more anisotropic in optically thick lines. In this situation the scales probed are restricted, due to absorption, to smaller scales which are known to be more anisotropic. We discuss how the sonic Mach number can affect the latter results, with highly supersonic cases exhibiting a lower degree of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation Techniques to Mitigate the Interloper Contamination for Line Intensity Mapping Experiments</title>

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) serves as a potent probe in astrophysics, relying on the statistical analysis of integrated spectral line emissions originating from distant star-forming galaxies. While LIM observations hold the promise of achieving a broad spectrum of scientific objectives, a significant hurdle for future experiments lies in distinguishing the targeted spectral line emitted at a specific redshift from undesired line emissions originating at different redshifts. The presence of these interloping lines poses a challenge to the accuracy of cosmological analyses. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantify line-line cross-correlations (LIM-LLX), enabling us to investigate the true signal amidst instrumental noise and interloping emissions. For example, at a redshift of approximately $z\sim3.7$, we observed that the measured auto-power spectrum of [CII] exhibited substantial bias, from interloping line emission. However, cross-correlating [CII] with CO(6-5) lines using a FYST-like experiment yielded a promising result, with a Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim 10$. This measurement is notably unbiased. Additionally, we explore the extensive capabilities of cross-correlation by leveraging various CO transitions to probe the tomographic Universe at lower redshifts through LIM-LLX. We further demonstrate that incorporating low-frequency channels, such as 90 GHz and 150 GHz, into FYST's EoR-Spec-like experiment can maximize the potential for cross-correlation studies, effectively reducing the bias introduced by instrumental noise and interlopers.</description>

      <title>Distinct radial acceleration relations of galaxies and galaxy clusters supports hyperconical modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravity, with great observational support on local scales. However, to keep GR valid over cosmic scales, some phenomena (such as flat galaxy rotation curves and the cosmic expansion history) require the assumption of exotic dark matter. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) indicates a tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass in galaxies. This suggests that the observations could be better explained by modified gravity theories without exotic matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative theory that was originally designed to explain flat galaxy rotation curves by using a new fundamental constant acceleration $a_0$, the so-called Milgromian parameter. However, this non-relativistic model is too rigid (with insufficient parameters) to fit the large diversity of observational phenomena. In contrast, a relativistic MOND-like gravity naturally emerges from the hyperconical model, which derives a fictitious acceleration compatible with observations. This study analyses the compatibility of the hyperconical model with respect to distinct RAR observations of 10 galaxy clusters obtained from HIFLUGCS and 60 high-quality SPARC galaxy rotation curves. The results show that a general relation can be fitted to most cases with only one or two parameters, with an acceptable $\chi^2$ and $p$-value. These findings suggest a possible way to complete the proposed modification of GR on cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>
