      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>

      <title>Sideward contact tracing in an epidemic model with mixing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic epidemic model with sideward contact tracing. We assume that infection is driven by interactions within mixing events (gatherings of two or more individuals). Once an infective is diagnosed, each individual who was infected at the same event as the diagnosed individual is contact traced with some given probability. Assuming few initial infectives in a large population, the early phase of the epidemic is approximated by a branching process with sibling dependencies. To address the challenges given by the dependencies, we consider sibling groups (individuals who become infected at the same event) as macro-individuals and define a macro-branching process. This allows us to derive an expression for the effective macro-reproduction number which corresponds to the effective individual reproduction number and represents a threshold for the behaviour of the epidemic. Through numerical illustrations, we show how the reproduction number varies with the mean size of mixing events, the rate of diagnosis and the tracing probability.</description>

      <title>Invariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the random walk 4-state Markov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks can represent evolutionary events that cannot be described by phylogenetic trees, such as hybridization, introgression, and lateral gene transfer. Studying phylogenetic networks under a statistical model of DNA sequence evolution can aid the inference of phylogenetic networks. Most notably Markov models like the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura-3 model can been employed to infer a phylogenetic network using phylogenetic invariants. In this article we determine all quadratic invariants for sunlet networks under the random walk 4-state Markov model, which includes the aforementioned models. Taking toric fiber products of trees and sunlet networks, we obtain a new class of invariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the same model. Furthermore, we apply our results to the identifiability problem of a network parameter. In particular, we prove that our new class of invariants of the studied model is not sufficient to derive identifiability of quarnets (4-leaf networks). Moreover, we provide an efficient method that is faster and more reliable than the state-of-the-art in finding a significant number of invariants for many level-1 phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of complexity and the origins of biochemical life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modern physics and biology satisfactorily explain the passage from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth and the first cells to present-day life, respectively, the origins of biochemical life still remain an open question. Since life, as we know it, requires extremely long genetic polymers, any answer to the question must explain how an evolving system of polymers of ever-increasing length could come about on a planet that otherwise consisted only of small molecular building blocks. In this work, we show that, under realistic constraints, an abstract polymer model can exhibit dynamics such that attractors in the polymer population space with a higher average polymer length are also more probable. We generalize from the model and formalize the notions of complexity and evolution for chemical reaction networks with multiple attractors. The complexity of a species is defined as the minimum number of reactions needed to produce it from a set of building blocks, which in turn is used to define a measure of complexity for an attractor. A transition between attractors is considered to be a progressive evolution if the attractor with the higher probability also has a higher complexity. In an environment where only monomers are readily available, the attractor with a higher average polymer length is more complex. Thus, our abstract polymer model can exhibit progressive evolution for a range of thermodynamically plausible rate constants. We also formalize criteria for open-ended and historically-contingent evolution and explain the role of autocatalysis in obtaining them. Our work provides a basis for searching for prebiotically plausible scenarios in which long polymers can emerge and yield populations with even longer polymers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic branching models for the telomeres dynamics in a model including telomerase activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides at the end of chromosomes, whose evolution over time is intrinsically related to biological ageing. In most cells, with each cell division, telomeres shorten due to the so-called end replication problem, which can lead to replicative senescence and a variety of age-related diseases. On the other hand, in certain cells, the presence of the enzyme telomerase can lead to the lengthening of telomeres, which may delay or prevent the onset of such diseases but can also increase the risk of cancer.In this article, we propose a stochastic representation of this biological model, which takes into account multiple chromosomes per cell, the effect of telomerase, different cell types and the dependence of the distribution of telomere length on the dynamics of the process. We study theoretical properties of this model, including its long-term behaviour. In addition, we investigate numerically the impact of the model parameters on biologically relevant quantities, such as the Hayflick limit and the Malthusian parameter of the population of cells.</description>
