      <title>On the interaction of dilatancy and friction in the behavior of fluid-saturated sheared granular materials: a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element Method study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional instabilities in fluid-saturated granular materials underlie critical natural hazards such as submarine landslides and earthquake initiation. Distinct failure behaviors emerge under subaerial and subaqueous conditions due to the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, interparticle friction, and fluid interactions. This study employs three-dimensional coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations to investigate the collapse and runout dynamics of dense and loose granular assemblies across these settings. Parametric analyses reveal that pore pressure evolution plays a central role in governing failure mechanisms: dense assemblies stabilize through dilation, while loose assemblies undergo rapid compaction and fluidization, particularly under subaqueous conditions. Spatiotemporal analyses of coarse-grained fields further highlight strain-rate-dependent behavior driven by evolving porosity and effective stress. Both environments exhibit rate-strengthening behavior that scales with the inertial number (In) and viscous number (Iv), though driven by distinct mechanisms: subaerial systems are dominated by interparticle contact networks, whereas subaqueous systems are influenced by fluid drag, pore-pressure buildup, and lubrication. An analytical solution for excess pore pressure is compared with breaching-induced pressure distributions from CFD-DEM simulations, using input parameters derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests. The model captures fluid-particle coupling effectively, reproducing comparable excess pore pressures at steady state, while early-time discrepancies underscore the complexities of transient interactions. These findings advance the understanding of failure mechanics in saturated granular media and support the development of physics-based models for mitigating hazards associated with subaqueous granular flows.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Conductivity of Earth's Iron-enriched Basal Magma Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surround the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth's basal magma ocean over time.</description>

      <title>Potential Global Sequestration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by Drylands Forestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drylands forestation offers the potential for significant long-term sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$. Consider sequestration of both organic and inorganic carbon by a planted semi-arid forest, based on carbon that originates from atmospheric CO$_2$. Measurements at Israel's Yatir forest give a sequestration rate of $\sim$550 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ as organic carbon in the tree's biomass. In addition, $\sim$216 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ precipitates as calcite (CaCO$_3$) in the soil due to a combination of microbial activity on organic soil carbon, and the reaction of soil water with CO$_2$ exhaled from tree roots. The exhaled CO$_2$ is formed when glucose (produced by photosynthesis) is oxidized to supply energy for the trees' cellular processes. Significantly, low rainfall in drylands precludes dissolving precipitated calcite. Published estimates restrict the potential drylands surface available for sustainable forestation to $\sim$4.5 million km$^2$, only $\sim$10$\%$ of the global drylands. The dominant limitation is the apparent lack of water. However, immediately under many drylands, there are fossil waters that had recharged underlying aquifers during prior wetter climatic regimes. Conservatively, including this water, at least 9.0 million km$^2$ is available for afforestation. Such an area may yield a potential total annual sequestration rate of $\sim$7.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$, divided between $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (organic) and $\sim$2.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (inorganic); a respectable $\sim$35$\%$ of the annual rate of atmospheric CO$_2$ increase. However, considering the reduction in land surface albedo (reflectivity), the effective cooling would be $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$. Drylands reforestation would provide additional area for sequestration.</description>
