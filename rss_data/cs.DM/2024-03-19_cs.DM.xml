      <title>An Upper Bound on the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) dimension is a standard measure in descriptive complexity theory for the structural complexity of a graph. We prove that the WL-dimension of a graph on $n$ vertices is at most $3/20 \cdot n + o(n)= 0.15 \cdot n + o(n)$. The proof develops various techniques to analyze the structure of coherent configurations.
  This includes sufficient conditions under which a fiber can be restored up to isomorphism if it is removed, a recursive proof exploiting a degree reduction and treewidth bounds, as well as an analysis of interspaces involving small fibers.
  As a base case, we also analyze the dimension of coherent configurations with small fiber size and thereby graphs with small color class size.</description>

      <title>The ultrametric backbone is the union of all minimum spanning forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum spanning trees and forests are powerful sparsification techniques that remove cycles from weighted graphs to minimize total edge weight while preserving node connectivity. They have applications in computer science, network science, and graph theory. Despite their utility and ubiquity, they have several limitations, including that they are only defined for undirected networks, they significantly alter dynamics on networks, and they do not generally preserve important network features such as shortest distances, shortest path distribution, and community structure. In contrast, distance backbones, which are subgraphs formed by all edges that obey a generalized triangle inequality, are well defined in both directed and undirected graphs and preserve those and other important network features. The backbone of a graph is defined with respect to a specified path-length operator that aggregates weights along a path to define its length, thereby associating a cost to indirect connections. The backbone is the union of all shortest paths between each pair of nodes according to the specified operator. One such operator, the max function, computes the length of a path as the largest weight of the edges that compose it (a weakest link criterion). It is the only operator that yields an algebraic structure for computing shortest paths that is consistent with De Morgan's laws. Applying this operator yields the ultrametric backbone of a graph in that (semi-triangular) edges whose weights are larger than the length of an indirect path connecting the same nodes (i.e., those that break the generalized triangle inequality based on max as a path-length operator) are removed. We show that the ultrametric backbone is the union of all minimum spanning forests in undriected graphs and provides a new generalization of minimum spanning trees to directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Exact and Heuristic Computation of the Scanwidth of Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To measure the tree-likeness of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a new width parameter that considers the directions of the arcs was recently introduced: scanwidth. We present the first algorithm that efficiently computes the exact scanwidth of general DAGs. For DAGs with one root and scanwidth $k$ it runs in $O(k \cdot n^k \cdot m)$ time. The algorithm also functions as an FPT algorithm with complexity $O(2^{4 \ell - 1} \cdot \ell \cdot n + n^2)$ for phylogenetic networks of level-$\ell$, a type of DAG used to depict evolutionary relationships among species. Our algorithm performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of synthetic networks up to 30 reticulations and 100 leaves within 500 seconds. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that obtains an average practical approximation ratio of 1.5 on these networks. While we prove that the scanwidth is bounded from below by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph, experiments suggest that for networks the parameters are close in practice.</description>

      <title>Plane Hamiltonian Cycles in Convex Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Rafla from 1988 asserts that every simple drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ admits a plane Hamiltonian cycle. It turned out that already the existence of much simpler non-crossing substructures in such drawings is hard to prove. Recent progress was made by Aichholzer et al. and by Suk and Zeng who proved the existence of a plane path of length $\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$ and of a plane matching of size $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ in every simple drawing of $K_{n}$.
  Instead of studying simpler substructures, we prove Rafla's conjecture for the subclass of convex drawings, the most general class in the convexity hierarchy introduced by Arroyo et al. Moreover, we show that every convex drawing of $K_n$ contains a plane Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices (Hamiltonian connectivity) and a plane $k$-cycle for each $3 \leq k \leq n$ (pancyclicity), and present further results on maximal plane subdrawings.</description>

      <title>Solving Combinatorial Pricing Problems using Embedded Dynamic Programming Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial pricing problem (CPP) is a bilevel problem in which the leader maximizes their revenue by imposing tolls on certain items that they can control. Based on the tolls set by the leader, the follower selects a subset of items corresponding to an optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. To accomplish the leader's goal, the tolls need to be sufficiently low to discourage the follower from choosing the items offered by the competitors. In this paper, we derive a single-level reformulation for the CPP by rewriting the follower's problem as a longest path problem using a dynamic programming model, and then taking its dual and applying strong duality. We proceed to solve the reformulation in a dynamic fashion with a cutting plane method. We apply this methodology to 2 distinct dynamic programming models, namely, a novel formulation designated as selection diagram and the well-known decision diagram. We also produce numerical results to evaluate their performances across 3 different specializations of the CPP and a closely related problem that is the knapsack interdiction problem. Our results showcase the potential of the 2 proposed reformulations over the natural value function approach, expanding the set of tools to solve combinatorial bilevel programs.</description>

      <title>On sampling symmetric Gibbs distributions on sparse random graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce efficient algorithms for approximate sampling from symmetric Gibbs distributions on the sparse random (hyper)graph. The examples we consider include (but are not restricted to) important distributions on spin systems and spin-glasses such as the q state antiferromagnetic Potts model for $q\geq 2$, including the colourings, the uniform distributions over the Not-All-Equal solutions of random k-CNF formulas. Finally, we present an algorithm for sampling from the spin-glass distribution called the k-spin model. To our knowledge this is the first, rigorously analysed, efficient algorithm for spin-glasses which operates in a non trivial range of the parameters.
  Our approach builds on the one that was introduced in [Efthymiou: SODA 2012]. For a symmetric Gibbs distribution $\mu$ on a random (hyper)graph whose parameters are within an certain range, our algorithm has the following properties: with probability $1-o(1)$ over the input instances, it generates a configuration which is distributed within total variation distance $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from $\mu$. The time complexity is $O((n\log n)^2)$.
  The algorithm requires a range of the parameters which, for the graph case, coincide with the tree-uniqueness region, parametrised w.r.t. the expected degree d. For the hypergraph case, where uniqueness is less restrictive, we go beyond uniqueness. Our approach utilises in a novel way the notion of contiguity between Gibbs distributions and the so-called teacher-student model.</description>

      <title>Optimal sets of questions for Twenty Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the distributional Twenty Questions game, Bob chooses a number $x$ from $1$ to $n$ according to a distribution $\mu$, and Alice (who knows $\mu$) attempts to identify $x$ using Yes/No questions, which Bob answers truthfully. Her goal is to minimize the expected number of questions.
  The optimal strategy for the Twenty Questions game corresponds to a Huffman code for $\mu$, yet this strategy could potentially uses all $2^n$ possible questions. Dagan et al. constructed a set of $1.25^{n+o(n)}$ questions which suffice to construct an optimal strategy for all $\mu$, and showed that this number is optimal (up to sub-exponential factors) for infinitely many $n$.
  We determine the optimal size of such a set of questions for all $n$ (up to sub-exponential factors), answering an open question of Dagan et al. In addition, we generalize the results of Dagan et al. to the $d$-ary setting, obtaining similar results with $1.25$ replaced by $1 + (d-1)/d^{d/(d-1)}$.</description>

      <title>Counting Answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries: Natural Tractability Criteria and Meta-Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of counting answers to unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) under structural restrictions on the input query. Concretely, given a class C of UCQs, the problem #UCQ(C) provides as input a UCQ Q in C and a database D and the problem is to compute the number of answers of Q in D.
  Chen and Mengel [PODS'16] have shown that for any recursively enumerable class C, the problem #UCQ(C) is either fixed-parameter tractable or hard for one of the parameterised complexity classes W[1] or #W[1]. However, their tractability criterion is unwieldy in the sense that, given any concrete class C of UCQs, it is not easy to determine how hard it is to count answers to queries in C. Moreover, given a single specific UCQ Q, it is not easy to determine how hard it is to count answers to Q.
  In this work, we address the question of finding a natural tractability criterion: The combined conjunctive query of a UCQ $\varphi_1 \vee \dots \vee \varphi_\ell$ is the conjunctive query $\varphi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \varphi_\ell$. We show that under natural closure properties of C, the problem #UCQ(C) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if the combined conjunctive queries of UCQs in C, and their contracts, have bounded treewidth. A contract of a conjunctive query is an augmented structure, taking into account how the quantified variables are connected to the free variables. If all variables are free, then a conjunctive query is equal to its contract; in this special case the criterion for fixed-parameter tractability of #UCQ(C) thus simplifies to the combined queries having bounded treewidth.
  Finally, we give evidence that a closure property on C is necessary for obtaining a natural tractability criterion: We show that even for a single UCQ Q, the meta problem of deciding whether #UCQ({Q}) can be solved in time $O(|D|^d)$ is NP-hard for any fixed $d\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Cut Facets and Cube Facets of Lifted Multicut Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifted multicut problem has diverse applications in the field of computer vision. Exact algorithms based on linear programming require an understanding of lifted multicut polytopes. Despite recent progress, two fundamental questions about these polytopes have remained open: Which lower cube inequalities define facets, and which cut inequalities define facets? In this article, we answer the first question by establishing conditions that are necessary, sufficient and efficiently decidable. Toward the second question, we show that deciding facet-definingness of cut inequalities is NP-hard. This completes the analysis of canonical facets of lifted multicut polytopes.</description>

      <title>Modelling reliability of reversible circuits with 2D second-order cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular automaton is a widely known model of both reversible and irreversible computations. The family of reversible second-order cellular automata considered in this work is appropriate both for construction of logic gates and analysis of damage distribution. The quantities such as formal dimension of damage patterns can be used only for rough estimation of consequences of particular faults and numerical experiments are provided for illustration of some subtleties. Such analysis demonstrates high sensitivity to errors from defects, lack of synchronization and too short intervals between signals.</description>
