      <title>Zero-point energy of solids from vacuum fluctuation and quantum geometric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of Rashba coupling from first principles: Layer-resolved orbital asymmetry in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials gives rise to a Rashba spin splitting when inversion and mirror symmetries are broken, yet its microscopic origin and quantitative characterization in transition metal dichalcogenides remains incomplete. Both symmetries are broken in certain bilayer structures, enabling Rashba splittings in the absence of external electric fields. We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. We further introduce the orbital polarization imbalance as an order parameter that captures the asymmetry of the valence bands and determines the spin ordering of the Rashba-split states. Our results are both quantitative and qualitative, as they clarify the nature and origin of Rashba coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Excess photon-assisted noise of Majorana and Andreev bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-assisted tunneling arises under an ac bias, with the drive frequency setting the photon energy. The excess photon-assisted noise is defined as the difference between the shot noise under a combined dc and ac bias and that under a dc bias alone. We investigate this quantity in tunneling into Majorana or Andreev bound states, which are of great interest in the search for topological superconductors. Under a harmonic bias $V(t)=V_\mathrm{dc}[1-\cos(\Omega t)]$, the excess photon-assisted noise exhibits distinct behaviors: for Majorana or quasi-Majorana bound states, it undergoes multiple sign reversals as $V_\mathrm{dc}$ increases and vanishes at nonzero integer values of $eV_\mathrm{dc}/\Omega$ (with $e$ the elementary charge), whereas for zero-energy Andreev bound states--particularly those producing nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks--it remains strictly negative over the entire $V_\mathrm{dc}$ range.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity on a kagome magnet coupled to a Rashba superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Irrational Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) fails for irrational magnetic fields owing to the breakdown of magnetic translational symmetry. Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(\phi/\phi_0) + g$. Through St\v{r}eda formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine interaction of electrons and holes with nuclei probed by optical orientation in MAPbI$_3$ perovskite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orientation of electron and hole spins by circularly polarized light is investigated for MAPbI$_3$ single crystals. The Hanle and polarization recovery effects measured in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, respectively, evidence the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins as the main factor determining the spin dynamics of charge carriers at cryogenic temperatures. The parameters of the nuclear spin fluctuations within the carrier localization volume are evaluated. Dynamic polarization of the nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 5 mT for acting on the electrons and -30 mT for acting on the holes.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic crystals resemble antiferromagnets in that they have no macroscopic magnetization, but unlike antiferromagnets they exhibit spin-split band structures. Here the transport properties of altermagnetic quantum dots and their antiferromagnetic twins are explored theoretically with the help of Landauer-Buttiker theory, symmetry considerations and tight-binding models. The influence of the symmetries of the quantum dots, their parent crystal lattices, their shapes and edges, lead arrangements and disorder on the anomalous Hall effect, the spin-Hall effect and spin filtering by the quantum dots are investigated.</description>

      <title>Highly Polarized and Long Range Dissipationless Spin Transport Due to Counterflowing Electron and Hole Edge Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of edge channels in the quantum Hall regime leads to dissipationless charge transport over long distances. When graphene is interfaced with a magnetic material, the exchange interaction lifts the Landau levels spin degeneracy. This causes the presence of counterflowing edge channels with opposite spin polarization. We show theoretically that the spin-flip scattering between these edge channels enables a dissipationless spin transport with larger than 100% spin polarization of the charge current. It also allows the transport of spin over macroscopically long distances, even in the absence of an applied charge current.</description>

      <title>Observation of e/4 charge at $\nu=1/2$ in GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) fall outside the standard Laughlin's and Jain's odd-denominator hierarchy. In this work, we study the FQHS $\nu=1/2$ in the lowest Landau level. The state is confined within a 70 nm-wide GaAs quantum well, where the electrons exhibit a bilayer-like charge distribution. Inter-layer interactions stabilize the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS, which is predicted to host quasiparticles with charge e/4 - with either Abelian or non-Abelian topological order. Here, we report on shot-noise measurements of partitioned quasiparticles at $\nu=1/2$, where charge partitioning is generated by a unique etch-defined quantum point contact. Our measurements were performed on two nominally identical devices, at two independent experimental setups. Analysis of shot noise in the weak-backscattering regime in each device reveals quasiparticles with charge e/4. These observations provide a clear benchmark for future studies aimed at probing the topological order of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS and its quasiparticles' exchange statistics.</description>

      <title>Magnon confinement and trapping at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon confinement and trapping refer to the localization of magnons-quasiparticles that represent collective spin-wave excitations in magnetic materials-within specific regions or structures. This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moir\'e superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Elastic field causing noncommutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a uniform torsion background, modeling a continuous density of screw dislocations and induces effective spatial noncommutativity and reshapes the energy spectrum of a free quantum particle. Within the geometric theory of defects, the metric yields a first-order (magnetic-like) coupling in the transverse dynamics, equivalent to an effective magnetic field $B_{eff}$ proportional to $p_z Omega$, where $Omega$ encodes the torsion strength. In the strong-coupling (Landau) regime, the planar coordinates obey [x,y] != 0 and the spectrum organizes into Landau-like levels with a slight electric-field-driven tilt and a uniform shift. Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the design and discovery of novel antimony oxychalcogenide monolayers Sb2X2O (X = S, Se) and Janus Sb2SSeO, examining their structural stability, elastic, electronic, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic properties. Our analysis confirms their thermodynamic and dynamical stability and reveals low cleavage energies, indicating strong feasibility for mechanical exfoliation. The excellent agreement between our HSE06-predicted bandgap of bulk Sb2S2O and experimental measurements further validates the employed computational framework. EWe also find that their optoelectronic responses can be efficiently tuned via biaxial strain, providing a viable route for device-specific property engineering. Favorable band alignments, strong optical absorption, efficient carrier transport, and relatively high dielectric constants collectively support their candidacy for overall water splitting under neutral conditions.These results establish a solid theoretical foundation for the rational design of Sb-based 2D nanostructures and highlight their potential in next-generation direction-dependent optoelectronic and sustainable energy-conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode and spin-valve effects on the surface of altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-CrSb and In-CrSb-In proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium leads and thick single crystal flakes of altermagnet CrSb. For double In-CrSb-In junctions, the obtained $dV/dI(B)$ curves are mirrored in respect to zero field for two magnetic field sweep directions, which is characteristic behavior of a Josephson spin valve. Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The latter is based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing against a background of the Zeeman splitting, so it is fully compatible with the requirements for the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetoelectric conductivity and electrochemical response from dipole-like sources of Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute longitudinal magnetoelectric conductivity ($\sigma_{zz}$) and nonlinear electrochemical response (ECR), applying the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, for three-dimensional nodal-ring semimetals (vortex nodal-rings and $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric nodal-rings) and three-band Hopf semimetals. While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $\sigma_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\boldsymbol{\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields.</description>

      <title>The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description>

      <title>GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>CDW Gap Collapse and Weyl State Restoration in (TaSe4)2I via Coherent Phonons: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent phonon excitation offers a nonthermal route to control quantum phases of condensed matter. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon landscape of (TaSe4)2I in its charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. We identify nine symmetry-preserving Raman-active modes that can suppress the Gamma-Z direct gap to the meV scale and render the system globally gapless by generating Weyl nodes at generic k points. Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime. Our results provide predictive insight for ultrafast pump-probe experiments and present a generalizable framework for lattice-driven topological switching in quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of anti-site defects in magnetic transitions of few-layer MnBi2Te4 by operando heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the first experimentally discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has attracted widespread attentions, providing a unique platform for the exploration of topological quantum phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state. Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45{\deg}C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Boosting high-current alkaline water electrolysis and carbon dioxide reduction with novel CuNiFe-based anodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to a green hydrogen economy demands robust, scalable, and sustainable anodes for alkaline water electrolysis operating at industrial current densities (&gt;1 A/cm2). However, achieving high activity and long-term stability under such conditions remains a formidable challenge with conventional catalysts. Here, we report a novel trimetallic CuNiFe anode fabricated through a rapid, single-step electrodeposition process at room temperature without organic additives. The catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of &lt;270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and operates stably for over 500 hours at 1 A cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH. In a practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM-WE), the CuNiFe anode enables a current density of 2.5 A cm(-2) at only 2.5 V, with a voltage efficiency of 66.8%. Beyond water splitting, this anode also significantly enhances CO2 electrolysis, tripling the CO2 reduction current density and steering selectivity toward valuable multi-carbon products when paired with commercial copper cathodes. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment confirms that the CuNiFe anode reduces the carbon footprint by an order of magnitude and decreases environmental impacts by 40-60% across multiple categories compared to benchmark IrRuO2. Our work establishes a scalable, high-performance, and environmentally benign anode technology, paving the way for cost-effective electrochemical production of green hydrogen and carbon-neutral chemicals.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Collective Blinking and Photon Bunching from CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Superlattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergent altermagnetism at surfaces of antiferromagnets: full symmetry classification and material identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of altermagnetism at the surfaces of antiferromagnets, vastly expanding the number of material candidates with altermagnetic characteristics and establishing a route to two-dimensional altermagnetism through surface-induced symmetry breaking. We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry at the surfaces of centrosymmetric collinear antiferromagnets lifts the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry ($PT$) and can generate nonrelativistic d-wave spin splitting, termed surface altermagnetism. Combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we show that surface inversion breaking, while necessary, is not sufficient for this effect. Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. These results establish a general, symmetry-based route to realizing robust, exchange-driven spin polarization at antiferromagnetic surfaces and interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators and skyrmion-hosting, chiral magnetic multilayers are two well-explored areas of modern condensed matter physics, each offering unique advantages for spintronics applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the optimization process for the growth of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$/buffer/[Pt/CoB/Ru]$_{\times N}$ heterostructure that combines these two material classes: the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ epilayer was grown by molecular beam epitaxy before transfer under ultrahigh vacuum to a separate growth chamber where the polycrystalline metallic multilayer was sputter deposited. The structure of the samples was characterized by co-fitted X-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Polarized neutron models and standard magnetometry show that a buffer layer exceeding a critical thickness is required to obtain the desired uniform, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in every magnetic layer in the multilayer. Samples with both Ta and Mo buffers were used requiring thicknesses of 1.5 and 0.9 nm respectively. In minimizing the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ terracing, buffered samples yield well-defined, out-of-plane, magnetic domains suitable for spin-orbit torque induced manipulation as determined by X-ray photoemission electron microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets can generate a transverse electrical response known as the anomalous Hall effect, even though they possess almost no net magnetization. The microscopic origin of this behaviour, however, has remained unclear because conventional measurement geometries mix different contributions to the measured response. Here, we show that applying magnetic fields in selected in-plane directions allows us to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the Hall effect in a representative noncollinear antiferromagnet. By suppressing any dipole-related signal, we isolate a purely octupole-driven Hall response that exhibits a characteristic three-fold angular symmetry. At low magnetic fields, we further observe an additional Hall-like contribution that arises from the scalar spin chirality associated with noncoplanar spin textures. Combining symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and transport measurements, we reveal that octupole order, dipole moments, and chirality coexist and contribute in distinct field regimes. These findings establish a framework for identifying and controlling complex magnetic order parameters for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Arrays of Josephson junctions can be tuned through anomalous metallic, quantum-critical, and insulating regimes. We introduce a new experimental probe, capturing microwave radiation across all three regimes, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. Our approach allows in-situ calibration of the sample's circuit parameters and provides isolation from measurement back-action effects. We measure the radiation temperature of the anomalous metal, and find that it is hotter than both the quantum-critical and insulating regimes. We further show that the anomalous-metallic regime is more susceptible to additional heating than other regimes, explaining its emergence in otherwise thermalized systems. Turning to the quantum-critical regime, we discover nonlinear scaling of radiative noise with applied bias, consistent with theoretical predictions of universal non-equilibrium behavior at quantum critical points.</description>

Abstract: Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-1 chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we identify a manifold consisting of the two lowest-lying, spin-singlet states isolated from doublet states of opposite fermion parity, which undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random Zeeman and/or spin-orbit coupling. Despite the unavoidable effect of quasiparticle poisoning on qubit performance, the isolation of the singlet states offers additional protection. In addition, we introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Modal Interactions in Nanomechanical Resonators with Soft Clamping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a chain of nonlinear modal interactions in softly clamped nanostring resonators. The process involves the sequential coupling of five mechanical modes, during frequency sweeps, yielding a broad nonlinear response with nearly constant amplitude. We demonstrate that soft clamping enables this cascaded energy transfer and amplifies the effective geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode by an order of magnitude. Analytical and finite element-based reduced-order models capture the key features of the coupling cascade and clarify its underlying mechanism. The phenomenon is generic in nonlinear vibrational systems and can be tailored through soft-clamping design strategies.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that the zero indirect band gap in the real part of the spectrum remains stable in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the parameter regime in which this robustness persists. We find that the appearance of the zero indirect gap coincides with the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Transport evidence of surface states in magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, leading to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description>

      <title>A modified Lindblad equation for a Rabi driven electron-spin qubit with tunneling to a Markovian lead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</description>

Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Two-color harmonic spectroscopy of ultrafast Dirac electron dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high-harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report a similar effect, pronounced ultrafast carrier saturation dynamics and harmonic emission suppression during nonperturbative harmonic generation (NPHG) in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports NPHG at laser intensities as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Ultrafast carrier saturation strongly modulates the interplay between interband and intraband currents, a key characteristic of NPHG in Dirac materials. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. The excitation of out-of-equilibrium hot carriers and the concomitant saturation near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our finding reveal that field-driven carrier saturation plays a critical role in gapless solid NPHG. We demonstrate the potential of NPHG and HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering novel opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. Efficient spin injection creates a significant spin accumulation of 20 meV and generates a spin diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect is expected to arise from nonlinear spin-charge interactions in the folded-bilayer graphene channel. These observed large spin signals and spin-diode effects in graphene systems offer a promising platform for developing active two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Circuit Fidelity in Transmon Qubit Rings via Operation Duration Tuning under Strong Connectivity Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, yet they face significant fidelity degradation due to connectivity noise, particularly in the intermediate coupling regime where noise levels are substantial. While prior works suggest that high fidelity requires operating in regimes with strongly suppressed noise, maintaining such conditions under practical experimental constraints remains challenging. To address this, we investigate quantum gate operations in fully connected transmon rings, examining both SWAP and general circuits. Our study reveals that fidelity can be significantly enhanced by tuning gate operation durations, with local maxima emerging even under strong noise conditions. These fidelity enhancements occur consistently across different qubit numbers and operation types, and for specific initial states -- particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement properties -- the achieved fidelities approach quantum error correction thresholds. Furthermore, we develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts the optimal operation durations for new devices, enabling efficient optimization without extensive experimental simulations. These results provide a pathway toward robust quantum circuit design in noisy experimental environments.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer 3D morphometric precision of polarisation-resolved wide-field optical extinction microscopy determines the roundness of individual gold nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we provide a step change by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are modelled for an ellipsoidal particle, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. The material permittivity and surface damping providing the best fit are found. The particle aspect ratio is determined with a precision better than 5%, and the size with an impressive precision of 0.1 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in the medium. Taking them into account improves the shape accuracy.</description>
