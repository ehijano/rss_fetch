      <title>Curve collapse for the isospin-2 pion scattering length from QCD with 3, 4, and 5 colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show comparisons of the pion - pion scattering length in the isospin - two channel from simulations of of QCD with $N_c = 3$, 4 and 5 colors and $N_f = 2$ flavors of degenerate mass fermions. The scattering length varies as $1/N_c$, as expected from large $N_c$ counting arguments.</description>

      <title>Toward the First Gluon Parton Distribution from the LaMET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present progress towards the first unpolarized gluon quasi-PDF from lattice QCD using high-statistics measurement with $a \approx 0.12$ fm and two valence pion masses $M_\pi \approx 310$ and $690$ MeV generated on $2+1+1$-flavors of HISQ ensemble by the MILC collaboration. In this study, we consider two different gluon operators, for which the hybrid-ratio renormalization matching kernels have been recently derived, and a third operator that has been used in prior pseudo-PDF studies of the gluon PDFs. We compare matrix elements for each operators for both nucleon and pseudo-scalar mesons, both pion masses, and two gauge-smearing techniques. Focusing on the more phenomenologically studied nucleon gluon PDF, we compare the ratio and hybrid-ratio renormalized matrix elements at both pion masses and both smearings to those reconstructed from the nucleon gluon PDF from the CT18 global analysis. We identify the best choice of operator to study the gluon PDF through LaMET and present the first gluon quasi-PDF under some caveats. Additionally, we explore the recent idea of Coulomb gauge fixing to improve signal at large Wilson line displacement and found it could be a major help in improving the signal of gluon matrix elements given the perturbative calculation to confirm our results. This work helps identify the best operator for studying the gluon quasi-PDF, shows higher hadron boost momentum is needed to implement hybrid-ratio renormalization reliably, and suggests the need to study more diverse set of operators with their corresponding perturbative calculations for hybrid-ratio renormalization to further gluon quasi-PDF study.</description>

      <title>Proper Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density and the pseudoscalar glueball mass in quenched lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02756v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper flow time for the Wilson flow in calculating the topological charge, topological susceptibility, and topological charge density correlator (TCDC) using the gluonic definition is analyzed. The proper flow time for the topological charge and TCDC is determined by different methods. The proper flow time may vary depending on whether the calculation is for the topological charge, topological density, topological susceptibility, or TCDC. Specifically, the flow time identified using the matching procedure is optimal for TCDC and a good choice for the topological susceptibility. Additionally, the pseudoscalar glueball is extracted from the TCDC using the bosonic definition at the identified proper flow time for three ensembles, and the continuum mass value is obtained through continuous extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Origins and impacts of dynamical diquark correlations -- A continuum Schwinger functional approach --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This conference proceedings contribution emphasizes the emergent hadron mass paradigm, which accounts for the majority of the visible mass in the universe, beyond the Higgs boson mechanism. The study delves into the Landau gauge gluon propagator and the dynamical generation of gluon mass, as well as the dressed-quark propagator and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. It also tackles the baryon bound state problem through the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, analyzing the composition and masses of octet and decuplet baryons. The document concludes with a discussion on the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and its first radial excitation, providing insights into the quark-diquark structure within baryons.</description>

      <title>Theory on CKM and heavy quark decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of precise experimental measurements and theoretical predictions allows to extract Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements or constrain flavor changing processes in the standard model. Focusing at theoretical predictions, we review recent highlights from the sector of heavy charm and bottom quark decays. Special emphasis is given to nonperturbative contributions due to the strong force calculated using lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions from the pseudo-distribution approach on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the description of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current focus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and theoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable and essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the structure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of the pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for unpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators computable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone parton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the quasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements, they are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data previously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers and nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold larger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$ GeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the resulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The matched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a fitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this procedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the framework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum transfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and $E$ GPDs.</description>
