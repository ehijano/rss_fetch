      <title>Single-molecule Surface-Induced Fluorescence Attenuation Based on Reduced Graphene Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule surface-induced fluorescence attenuation (smSIFA) is a precise method for studying the vertical movement of biological macromolecules using two-dimensional material acceptors. Unlike other methods, smSIFA is not influenced by the planar motion of membranes or proteins. However, the detection range and accuracy of vertical movement are dependent on the properties of these two-dimensional materials. Recently, smSIFA utilizing graphene oxide and graphene has significantly advanced the study of biomacromolecules, although the detection range is restricted by their inherent quenching distances. Modifying these distances necessitates the replacement of the medium material, which presents challenges in material selection and preparation. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop controllable materials for smSIFA applications. In this study, we enhance the smSIFA technique using graphene oxide as the medium acceptor through thermal reduction. By adjusting the reduction temperature, we prepare reduced graphene oxides at varying degrees of reduction, thus fine-tuning the quenching distances. The adjustment of these distances is measured using fluorescently labeled DNA. This modified smSIFA approach, employing reduced graphene oxide, is then applied to observe conformational changes in the Holliday junction, demonstrating the enhanced detection capabilities of reduced graphene oxide.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Nanoscale Dynamics in Membrane Protein Insertion via Single-Molecule Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane proteins often need to be inserted into or attached on the cell membrane to perform their functions. Understanding their transmembrane topology and conformational dynamics during insertion is crucial for elucidating their roles. However, it remains challenging to monitor nanoscale changes in insertion depth of individual proteins in membranes. Here, we introduce two single molecule imaging methods, SIFA and LipoFRET, designed for in vitro observation of the nanoscale architecture of membrane proteins within membranes. These methods have demonstrated their efficacy in studying biomolecules interacting with bio-membranes with sub-nanometer precision.</description>

      <title>Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect: cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the spatial structural alteration in the human brain tissues and cells and DNA and chromatin due to Parkinsons disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinsons disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinsons, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA and chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinsons disease tissues and cells when compared to normal tissues and cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA and chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA and chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.</description>

      <title>Label-free SERS Discrimination of Proline from Hydroxylated Proline at Single-molecule Level Assisted by a Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discriminating the low-abundance hydroxylated proline from hydroxylated proline is crucial for monitoring diseases and eval-uating therapeutic outcomes that require single-molecule sensors. While the plasmonic nanopore sensor can detect the hydrox-ylation with single-molecule sensitivity by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), it suffers from intrinsic fluctuations of single-molecule signals as well as strong interference from citrates. Here, we used the occurrence frequency histogram of the single-molecule SERS peaks to extract overall dataset spectral features, overcome the signal fluctuations and investigate the citrate-replaced plasmonic nanopore sensors for clean and distinguishable signals of proline and hydroxylated proline. By ligand exchange of the citrates by analyte molecules, the representative peaks of citrates decreased with incubation time, prov-ing occupation of the plasmonic hot spot by the analytes. As a result, the discrimination of the single-molecule SERS signals of proline and hydroxylated proline was possible with the convolutional neural network model with 96.6% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of fractal and multifractal connection to structural disorder in weakly optical disordered media: Application to cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light scattering experiment establishes a relationship between refractive index fluctuations and fractal dimension in weakly scattering tissue-like media. Based on the box-counting approach, an analytical model is developed and shows that the fractal dimension has a functional dependency on the structural disorder or refractive index fluctuation for short-range correlation and approximately linearly depends on each other for tissue-like media. Several parametric imaging systems can be connected using this approach. Further, tissue's weak multifractality optical scattering is explored using the box-counting method. It is shown that with a functional transformation, the distribution follows lognormal distributions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations lie at the heart of statistical physics, yet their formulation in nonequilibrium steady states remains challenging. This Letter makes two key contributions to this field: First, we establish fundamental limits on nonequilibrium steady-state responses by deriving upper bounds on response precisions using steady-state Fisher information. Our analysis reveals that the sensitivity of observables to perturbations is governed by mean first passage times, steady-state currents, and activities, though it cannot be enhanced indefinitely by increasing these quantities. Notably, we demonstrate that the role of activity in response precision parallels that of repeated measurements in metrology. Second, we develop novel identities connecting the responses to arbitrarily strong perturbations with those to small perturbations. These identities significantly extend previous nonequilibrium response theories, which primarily focused on small perturbations, to encompass arbitrarily strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Direct estimates of irreversibility from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale cuticle mass density variations influenced by pigmentation in butterfly wing scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How pigment distribution influences the cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact final reflected color remains unknown. We used ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

      <title>Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.</description>
