      <title>Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Dynamics on Near-Term Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of quantum dynamics are a key application of near term quantum computing, but are hindered by the twin challenges of noise and small device scale, which limit the executable circuit depths and the number of qubits the algorithm can be run on. Towards overcoming these obstacles we develop and implement a distributed variant of the projected Variational Quantum Dynamics which we dub dp-VQD, which allows to simultaneously alleviate circuit depth and width limitations. We employ the wire cutting technique, which can be executed on the existing devices without quantum or classical communication. We demonstrate the full variational training on noisy simulators, and execute and perform the reconstruction on real IBM quantum devices. The algorithm allows to execute Hamiltonian evolution simulations for problem sizes exceeding devices' nominal qubit counts, and to combine multiple small devices in a distributed computation. We test our approach on the Heisenberg and Hubbard model dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials poised to supplant DFT in modeling general defects in metals and random alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/{\AA} for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.</description>

      <title>Stacking effects on magnetic, vibrational, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals layered semiconductor CrSBr, which exhibits A-type antiferromagnetism and a relatively high N\'{e}el temperature, has been successfully exfoliated into atomically thin sheets. In this study, we investigate the structural, lattice dynamical, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of four distinct stacking structures of CrSBr bilayers using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings show that though the most energetically favorable bilayer structure retains the stacking pattern of the bulk counterpart, three other high-symmetry stacking structures can be achieved by sliding one of the layers along three distinct directions, with energy costs comparable to that observed in MoS$_2$ bilayer. All these four bilayers exhibit semiconductor behavior with A-type antiferromagnetic ordering, similar to the bulk material, and demonstrate closely aligned N\'{e}el temperatures. Moreover, these bilayers exhibit relatively low lattice thermal conductivities, pronounced anisotropy, and a strong dependence on stacking patterns. This behavior is attributed to significant phonon-phonon scattering arising from avoided crossings between acoustic and optical phonons, as well as the presence of flat optical phonon bands in the low-frequency region. While the electronic structures and optical properties of these bilayers show weak dependence on the stacking pattern for antiferromagnetic ordering, they undergo significant changes for ferromagnetic ordering, influencing the band gap, valence and conduction band splitting, and effective mass. Furthermore, we found that antiferromagnetic ordering can transition to ferromagnetic under intense visible light illumination. Thus, the integration of layer stacking and visible light illumination offers an effective means to control the heat transfer, magnetic, and optical properties of CrSBr bilayers.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>EigenCWD: a spatially-varying deconvolution algorithm for single metalens imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of optics through the use of two-dimensional metalenses has enabled novel applications in imaging. To date, single-lens imaging remains the most common configuration, in part due to the limited focusing efficiency of metalenses. This results in limitations when it comes to wavefront manipulation and, thus, unavoidable aberrations in the formed image that require computational deconvolution to deblur the image. For certain lens profiles, such as the most common hyperbolic one that results in the highest efficiencies, at large fields of view, spatially-varying aberrations such as coma or astigmatism are prominent. These aberrations cannot be corrected for by traditional deconvolution methods, such as Wiener filtering. Here, we develop a spatially-varying deconvolution algorithm based on eigenvalue column-wise decomposition (eigenCWD). EigenCWD solves a minimization problem of the error between the measured image and the estimated image of the object to be reconstructed through an approximate forward blurring model. This approximate forward model uses an eigendecomposition of the spatially-varying point spread functions for fast computation, allowing for efficient scaling to larger image sizes and blurring kernels common in metalens imaging. We demonstrate eigenCWD's ability to correct spatially-varying blur and distortions for various lens profiles, surpassing that of the Wiener filter.</description>

      <title>Search for stable and low-energy Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerium-based intermetallics have garnered significant research attention as potential new permanent magnets. In this study, we explore the compositional and structural landscape of Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds using a machine learning (ML)-guided framework integrated with first-principles calculations. We employ a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN), which enables efficient screening for promising candidates, significantly accelerating the materials discovery process. With this approach, we predict five stable compounds, Ce3Co3Cu, CeCoCu2, Ce12Co7Cu, Ce11Co9Cu and Ce10Co11Cu4, with formation energies below the convex hull, along with hundreds of low-energy (possibly metastable) Ce-Co-Cu ternary compounds. First-principles calculations reveal that several structures are both energetically and dynamically stable. Notably, two Co-rich low-energy compounds, Ce4Co33Cu and Ce4Co31Cu3, are predicted to have high magnetizations.</description>

      <title>CaNS-Fizzy: A GPU-accelerated finite difference solver for turbulent two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CaNS-Fizzy -- Fizzy for short -- is a GPU-accelerated numerical solver for massively-parallel Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of incompressible two-phase flows. A DNS enables direct access to all flow quantities, resolved in time and space at all relevant continuum scales. The resulting numerical experiments provide complete data sets for the analysis of the detailed mechanisms underlying the flow, particularly the interaction between the chaotic and multi-scale dynamics of turbulence and the interface movement and deformation. The insights gained can guide the design and operation of various applications, such as boiling heat transfer, liquid-liquid extraction, gas-liquid reactors, absorption and stripping columns, distillation columns, liquid combustion appliances, in all of which the rate of heat and mass transfer between phases is proportional to the interfacial area. Fizzy's two-phase capabilities were implemented using the efficient, GPU-accelerated Navier-Stokes solver CaNS as base.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. We recently proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

      <title>Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Modeling Reactions on the Solid-Liquid Interface With Next Generation Extended Lagrangian Quantum-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate how extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer quantum-based molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) can be used to simulate heterogeneous electrocatalytic reactions. In particular, we apply our framework to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism on nitrogen-doped graphene in an aqueous solution. The electronic ground state and total energy of XL-BOMD are stabilized through nuclear and electronic equations of motion assisted by an integral kernel updated with low-rank approximations. A species charge analysis reveals that the XL-BOMD simulations can be used to detect electron transfer between the catalyst surface and the solvated molecular oxygen mediated by water molecules, resulting in the molecular dissociation of O$_2$. Simulations of the ORR under high electrochemical biases contribute to a larger body of work elucidating an outer-sphere ORR mechanism in which reduction occurs through water networks without direct adsorption of molecular oxygen.</description>
