      <title>Real and complex K-theory for higher rank graph algebras arising from cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Evans spectral sequence and its counter-part for real $K$-theory, we compute both the real and complex $K$-theory of several infinite families of $C^*$-algebras based on higher-rank graphs of rank $3$ and $4$. The higher-rank graphs we consider arise from double-covers of cube complexes. By considering the real and complex $K$-theory together, we are able to carry these computations much further than might be possible considering complex $K$-theory alone. As these algebras are classified by $K$-theory, we are able to characterize the isomorphism classes of the graph algebras in terms of the combinatorial and number-theoretic properties of the construction ingredients.</description>

      <title>Traces on the uniform tracial completion of $\mathcal{Z}$-stable C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniform tracial completion of a C*-algebra A with compact non-empty trace space T(A) is obtained by completing the unit ball with respect to the uniform 2-seminorm $\|a\|_{2,T(A)}=\sup_{\tau \in T(A)} \tau(a^*a)^{1/2}$. The trace problem asks whether every trace on the uniform tracial completion is the $\|\cdot\|_{2,T(A)}$-continuous extension of a trace on A. We answer this question positively in the case of C*-algebras that tensorially absorb the Jiang-Su algebra, such as those studied in the Elliott classification programme.</description>

      <title>Self-absorption of Hankel systems on monoids --a seemingly universal property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any cancellative monoid $\mathcal{M}$, we study the Hankel system determined by its multiplication table. We prove that the Hankel system admits self-absorption property provided that the monoid $\mathcal{M}$ has the local algebraic structure: \[ \big(ax = by, cx=dy, az=bw \,\, \text{in $\mathcal{M}$}\big)\Longrightarrow \big(cz=dw \,\, \text{in $\mathcal{M}$}\big). \] Our result holds for all group-embeddable monoids and goes beyond. In particular, it works for all cancellative Abelian monoids and most common non-Abelian cancellative monoids such as $$ \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{N}): = \big\{[a_{ij}]_{1\le i,j\le d}\in \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{Z})\big| a_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}\big\}. $$ The Hankel system determined by the multiplication table of a monoid is further generalized to that determined by level sets of any abstract two-variable map. We introduce an algebraic notion of lunar maps and establish a stronger hereditary self-absorption property for the corresponding generalized Hankel systems. As a consequence, we prove the self-absorption property for arbitrary spatial compression of the regular representation system $\{\lambda_G(g)\}_{g\in G}$ of any discrete group $G$, as well as the Hankel system $\{\Gamma_\ell^\Phi\}$ determined by the level sets of any rational map of the form $\Phi(x,y)=a x^m + b y^n$ with $a,b,m,n\in \mathbb{Z}^*$: \[ \Gamma_\ell^{\Phi}(x, y)= \mathbf{1}(a x^m + b y^n= \ell), \quad x, y\in \mathbb{N}^*, \, \ell\in \Phi (\mathbb{N}^*\times \mathbb{N}^*). \] The self-absorption property is applied to the study of completely bounded Fourier multipliers between Hardy spaces. Further applications are: i) exact complete bounded norm of the Carleman embedding in any dimension; ii) mixed Fourier-Schur multiplier inequalities with critical exponent $4/3$; iii) failure of hyper-complete-contractivity for the Poisson semigroup.</description>

      <title>Computing the noncommutative inner rank by means of operator-valued free probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the noncommutative version of the Edmonds' problem, which asks to determine the inner rank of a matrix in noncommuting variables. We provide an algorithm for the calculation of this inner rank by relating the problem with the distribution of a basic object in free probability theory, namely operator-valued semicircular elements. We have to solve a matrix-valued quadratic equation, for which we provide precise analytical and numerical control on the fixed point algorithm for solving the equation. Numerical examples show the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>
