      <title>Development of HfO$_{2-X}$-based Neural Memristor Utilizing Tantalum and Molybdenum Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we have fabricated a Ta/HfO$_{2-X}$/Mo-based single-cell memristor, a unique configuration worldwide. The synaptic behaviour of Tantalum and Molybdenum electrodes on an HfOx-based memristor device has been investigated. HfO$_{2-X}$ (15 nm) was grown using the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method, and electrodes were fabricated using a sputtering system and photolithography method. The metal oxide stoichiometry was ascertained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and paired pulsed facilitation (PPF) characteristics, which play a significant role in the learning processes of artificial neural networks, have been successfully obtained. Current-voltage measurements and retention tests were performed to determine the SET and RESET states of the device in appropriate ranges. The results show that this memristor device is a strong candidate for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) applications.</description>

      <title>Spatial Quantization: Improving RRA Performance via Closely Spaced Elements Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the new perspective of spatial quantization, this article systematically studies the advantages of reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) designed with closely spaced elements in terms of sidelobe level (SLL), scanning accuracy, scan loss and beam granularity, including theoretical analysis and simulation verification. This article sequentially studies RRAs with element periods of {\lambda}/2, {\lambda}/4 and {\lambda}/8. Both theoretical and simulation results show that under the condition of the same aperture size, with the number of spatial quantization bits increasing, 1bit RRA using closely spaced structure SLL will have a improvement of about 5dB. The scanning accuracy at 60{\deg} is improved from 54.52{\deg} at {\lambda}/2 to 57.97{\deg} at {\lambda}/8, while the scan loss is improved from 5.02dB at {\lambda}/2 to 2.85dB at {\lambda}/8. In terms of beam granularity, the beam granularity is increased by about 4 times for every 1bit of spatial quantization encryption in the RRA element period. The beam granularity at 0{\deg} of 1bit RRA with unit period of {\lambda}/2 is 0.166{\deg}, {\lambda}/4 is 0.033{\deg}, and {\lambda}/8 is 0.009{\deg}. This study has an important reference value for reconfigurable reflectarray design, communication system and radar design.</description>

      <title>A Study of Four-Switch Cross-Shaped RIS and A Novel Design Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the working principle of four-switch cross-shaped reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in detail and reveals the different types of RIS that can be designed based on this structure. Combined with the design examples using this structure in the currently published articles, this paper summarizes and organizes them, and also points out several RIS solutions that have not been designed using this structure. Finally, based on this four-switch cross-shaped structure, this paper proposes a novel RIS design example that can realize the function switching of 1-bit ultra-wideband (UWB) and 2-bit narrowband, and conducts simulation verification. The simulation results show that by optimizing the element structure and controlling the states of the four switches, the 1-bit ultra-wideband function can achieve a frequency band coverage of 10.5GHz-19.8GHz and a 2-bit phase quantization function around 18.12GHz. At the same time, it can realize 60{\deg} two-dimensional beam scanning function. We call this novel design "bit reconfigurable metasurface".</description>

      <title>Design rules for low-insertion-loss magnonic transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for the design of magnonic transducers, where waveguide antennas generate and pick up spin-wave signals. Our method relies on the combination of circuit-level models with micromagnetic simulations and allows simulation of complex geometries in the magnonic domain. We validated our model with experimental measurements, which showed good agreement witch the predicted scattering parameters of the system. Using our model we identified scaling rules of the antenna radiation resistance and we show strategies to maximize transduction efficiency between the electric and magnetic domains. We designed a transducer pair on YIG with 5dB insertion loss in a 100 MHz band, an unusually low value for micron-scale spin-wave devices. This demonstrates that magnonic devices can be very efficient and competitive in RF applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Bubble curtains for noise mitigation: one vs. two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble curtains are widely used to protect marine life from exposure to noise during offshore construction. However, operating a bubble curtain is costly. Therefore optimizing the acoustic effect of the available air is important. An interesting approach is to split the airflow rate into two separate bubble curtains, rather than one single curtain. This concept is tested experimentally and numerically. The experiments and the model show an increase in performance of the compressed air when it is split between two manifolds. An increased insertion loss of up to 11dB is measured. This increase in performance is possibly due to the fact that the reflective properties of the bubble curtains are maintained when halving the airflow rate. In effect, by splitting the airflow a second acoustic barrier is added. Additionally, the variations in the bubble curtain performance between individual measurements are shown to be largely caused by temporal variations in the air distribution. The applicability of equivalent fluid models for bubble curtains is discussed, and it is shown that accounting for a gap in the bubble curtain, close to the manifold where the bubble curtain is not fully developed, results in better agreement between the modelled and the measured insertion loss.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound matrix imaging for transcranial in-vivo localization microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.</description>

      <title>Ultra-miniaturized Bloch mode metasplitters for one-dimensional grating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present, for the first time, power splitters with multiple channel configurations in one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs) that maintain crystal lattice-sensitive Bloch mode profiles without perturbation across all output channels, all within an ultra-miniaturized footprint of just 2.1 x 2.2 {\mu}m^2. This novel capability reduces the need for transition regions, simplifies multi-channel configurations of 1DGWs, and maximizes the effective use of chip area. The pixelated metamaterial approach, integrated with a time-domain heuristic algorithm, is utilized to concurrently achieve broadband operation, optimized dispersion control, and minimal loss. We experimentally demonstrate that our 1x2 and 1x3 metasplitters achieve average minimum losses per channel of 3.80 dB and 5.36 dB, respectively, just 0.80 dB and 0.59 dB above ideal splitting. The measurements for both designs demonstrate a 1 dB bandwidth of 15 nm, with excellent uniformity across all output channels. These versatile metasplitter designs can serve as fundamental building blocks for ultrahigh-bandwidth, densely integrated photonic circuits and in scenarios where slow light is essential.</description>

      <title>Integral Micromorphic Model Reproducing Dispersion in 1D Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper develops a new integral micromorphic elastic continuum model, which can describe dispersion properties of band-gap metamaterials, i.e., metamaterials that inhibit propagation of waves in a certain frequency range. The enrichment consists in nonlocal averaging of three terms in the expression for the potential energy density of the standard micromorphic continuum. After proper calibration, such a formulation can exactly reproduce two given branches of the dispersion curve (acoustic and optical), even in cases with a band gap. The calibration process exploits Fourier images of the unknown weight functions, which are analytically deduced from the dispersion relation of the material of interest. The weight functions are then reconstructed in the spatial domain by numerical evaluation of the inverse Fourier transform. The presented approach is validated on several examples, including a discrete mass-spring chain with two alternating masses, for which the dispersion relation has an explicit analytical form and the optical and acoustic branches are separated by a band gap.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Neuron Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Low-Power Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity adjustable in-line high-temperature sensor based on metal microwire optical Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\deg}C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/{\deg}C within the temperature range of 50{\deg}C to 440{\deg}C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications</description>
