      <title>The Codecfake Dataset and Countermeasures for the Universally Detection of Deepfake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Audio Language Model (ALM) based deepfake audio, there is an urgent need for effective detection methods. Unlike traditional deepfake audio generation, which often involves multi-step processes culminating in vocoder usage, ALM directly utilizes neural codec methods to decode discrete codes into audio. Moreover, driven by large-scale data, ALMs exhibit remarkable robustness and versatility, posing a significant challenge to current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models. To effectively detect ALM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the mechanism of the ALM-based audio generation method, the conversion from neural codec to waveform. We initially construct the Codecfake dataset, an open-source large-scale dataset, including two languages, millions of audio samples, and various test conditions, tailored for ALM-based audio detection. Additionally, to achieve universal detection of deepfake audio and tackle domain ascent bias issue of original SAM, we propose the CSAM strategy to learn a domain balanced and generalized minima. Experiment results demonstrate that co-training on Codecfake dataset and vocoded dataset with CSAM strategy yield the lowest average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.616% across all test conditions compared to baseline models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Speech Pattern Disorders in Autism using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by identifying abnormal speech patterns from examiner-patient dialogues presents significant challenges due to the subtle and diverse manifestations of speech-related symptoms in affected individuals. This study presents a comprehensive approach to identify distinctive speech patterns through the analysis of examiner-patient dialogues. Utilizing a dataset of recorded dialogues, we extracted 40 speech-related features, categorized into frequency, zero-crossing rate, energy, spectral characteristics, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and balance. These features encompass various aspects of speech such as intonation, volume, rhythm, and speech rate, reflecting the complex nature of communicative behaviors in ASD. We employed machine learning for both classification and regression tasks to analyze these speech features. The classification model aimed to differentiate between ASD and non-ASD cases, achieving an accuracy of 87.75%. Regression models were developed to predict speech pattern related variables and a composite score from all variables, facilitating a deeper understanding of the speech dynamics associated with ASD. The effectiveness of machine learning in interpreting intricate speech patterns and the high classification accuracy underscore the potential of computational methods in supporting the diagnostic processes for ASD. This approach not only aids in early detection but also contributes to personalized treatment planning by providing insights into the speech and communication profiles of individuals with ASD.</description>

      <title>An LSTM-Based Chord Generation System Using Chroma Histogram Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a system for chord generation to monophonic symbolic melodies using an LSTM-based model trained on chroma histogram representations of chords. Chroma representations promise more harmonically rich generation than chord label-based approaches, whilst maintaining a small number of dimensions in the dataset. This system is shown to be suitable for limited real-time use. While it does not meet the state-of-the-art for coherent long-term generation, it does show diatonic generation with cadential chord relationships. The need for further study into chroma histograms as an extracted feature in chord generation tasks is highlighted.</description>

      <title>SVDD Challenge 2024: A Singing Voice Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated singing voices, which now closely mimic natural human singing and align seamlessly with musical scores, has led to heightened concerns for artists and the music industry. Unlike spoken voice, singing voice presents unique challenges due to its musical nature and the presence of strong background music, making singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) a specialized field requiring focused attention. To promote SVDD research, we recently proposed the "SVDD Challenge," the very first research challenge focusing on SVDD for lab-controlled and in-the-wild bonafide and deepfake singing voice recordings. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the 2024 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT 2024).</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Recurrent Neural Networks for Virtual Analog Audio Effects Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog electronic circuits are at the core of an important category of musical devices. The nonlinear features of their electronic components give analog musical devices a distinctive timbre and sound quality, making them highly desirable. Artificial neural networks have rapidly gained popularity for the emulation of analog audio effects circuits, particularly recurrent networks. While neural approaches have been successful in accurately modeling distortion circuits, they require architectural improvements that account for parameter conditioning and low latency response. In this article, we explore the application of recent machine learning advancements for virtual analog modeling. We compare State Space models and Linear Recurrent Units against the more common Long Short Term Memory networks. These have shown promising ability in sequence to sequence modeling tasks, showing a notable improvement in signal history encoding. Our comparative study uses these black box neural modeling techniques with a variety of audio effects. We evaluate the performance and limitations using multiple metrics aiming to assess the models' ability to accurately replicate energy envelopes, frequency contents, and transients in the audio signal. To incorporate control parameters we employ the Feature wise Linear Modulation method. Long Short Term Memory networks exhibit better accuracy in emulating distortions and equalizers, while the State Space model, followed by Long Short Term Memory networks when integrated in an encoder decoder structure, outperforms others in emulating saturation and compression. When considering long time variant characteristics, the State Space model demonstrates the greatest accuracy. The Long Short Term Memory and, in particular, Linear Recurrent Unit networks present more tendency to introduce audio artifacts.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to extract the sounding object from a video frame, which is represented by a pixel-wise segmentation mask for application scenarios such as multi-modal video editing, augmented reality, and intelligent robot systems. The pioneering work conducts this task through dense feature-level audio-visual interaction, which ignores the dimension gap between different modalities. More specifically, the audio clip could only provide a Global semantic label in each sequence, but the video frame covers multiple semantic objects across different Local regions, which leads to mislocalization of the representationally similar but semantically different object. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Network (C3N) to align the audio-visual semantics from the global dimension and progressively inject them into the local regions via an attention mechanism. Firstly, a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus Inference Module (C3IM) is developed to extract a unified-modal label by integrating audio/visual classification confidence and similarities of modality-agnostic label embeddings. Then, we feed the unified-modal label back to the visual backbone as the explicit semantic-level guidance via a Cognitive Consensus guided Attention Module (CCAM), which highlights the local features corresponding to the interested object. Extensive experiments on the Single Sound Source Segmentation (S4) setting and Multiple Sound Source Segmentation (MS3) setting of the AVSBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/ZhaofengSHI/AVS-C3N once accepted.</description>

      <title>AdaProj: Adaptively Scaled Angular Margin Subspace Projections for Anomalous Sound Detection with Auxiliary Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function for training the embedding model is presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers, AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces while still ensuring an angular margin between classes. By doing so, the resulting distributions of the embeddings belonging to normal data are not required to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 anomalous sound detection datasets, it is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly outperforms other commonly used loss functions.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction with Reverse Selective Auditory Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) aims to extract the specific person's speech from the audio mixture given auxiliary visual cues. Previous methods usually search for the target voice through speech-lip synchronization. However, this strategy mainly focuses on the existence of target speech, while ignoring the variations of the noise characteristics. That may result in extracting noisy signals from the incorrect sound source in challenging acoustic situations. To this end, we propose a novel reverse selective auditory attention mechanism, which can suppress interference speakers and non-speech signals to avoid incorrect speaker extraction. By estimating and utilizing the undesired noisy signal through this mechanism, we design an AV-TSE framework named Subtraction-and-ExtrAction network (SEANet) to suppress the noisy signals. We conduct abundant experiments by re-implementing three popular AV-TSE methods as the baselines and involving nine metrics for evaluation. The experimental results show that our proposed SEANet achieves state-of-the-art results and performs well for all five datasets. We will release the codes, the models and data logs.</description>
