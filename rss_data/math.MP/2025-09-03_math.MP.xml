      <title>Resonances for the one dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with the matrix-valued complex square-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the resonances of (generally, non-selfadjoint) Schr\"odinger operators with matrix-valued square-well potentials. We compute explicitly the Jost function and derive complex transcendental equations for the resonances. We prove several results concerning the distribution of resonances in the complex plane. We compute the multiplicity of resonances and prove a version of the Weyl Law for the number of resonances.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac materials in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields via Heun functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the study of the spectral problem for Dirac materials immersed in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields. To achieve this, the system of differential equations satisfied by the eigenfunction components of the Hamiltonian has been decoupled, and the solutions for some specific cases have been analyzed using Heun functions, which provide us with a quantization relation and allow us to determine the solutions for the bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-J Fermi gas, interacting through a general repulsive 2-body potential, and prove asymptotics of the ground state energy in the dilute limit. The asymptotic behaviour is given in terms of the ground state energy of a spin chain, which is the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the case of spin-1/2 fermions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and delocalization for random Schrodinger operators with $\delta$-interactions in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the random Schrodinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with independent, identically distributed random variables and single-site potentials given by $\delta$-functions on $\mathbb{Z}^3$, exhibit both dynamical localization and dynamical delocalization with probability one. That is, there are regions in the deterministic spectrum that exhibit dynamical localization, the nonspreading of wave packets, and regions in the deterministic spectrum where the models also exhibit nontrivial quantum transport, almost surely. These models are the first examples of ergodic, random Schrodinger operators exhibiting both dynamical localization and delocalization in dimension three or higher. The nontrivial transport is due to the presence of delocalized generalized eigenfunctions at positive energies $E &gt; \pi^2$. The general idea of the proof follows [Hislop, Kirsch, Krishna (2024)] in which lower bounds on moments of the position operator are constructed using these generalized eigenfunctions. A new result of independent interest is a proof of the Combes-Thomas estimate on exponential decay of the Green's function for Schrodinger operators with infinitely-many $\delta$-potentials.</description>

      <title>Multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with long-range swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP) with long-range swap, a new interacting particle system combining the backward-push rule with the forward-jump rule. Although governed by local dynamics, the model induces effective long-range particle exchanges. We establish its integrability by proving two-particle reducibility and showing that the associated scattering matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we derive explicit contour integral formulas for transition probabilities. These results position the long-range swap model as a novel exactly solvable multispecies process, characterized by distinctive algebraic features and opening new directions for further study in integrable probability and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and Resonances of Stark Hamiltonians with $\delta$--Shell Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stark Hamiltonian with a $\delta$--interaction supported on a hypersphere, with boundary strength $\alpha\in L^\infty(S_a)$. Using the framework of quasi boundary triples, we construct self--adjoint realizations and derive a Krein--type resolvent formula. For $F\neq0$ we prove $\sigma(H_{F,\alpha})=\sigma_{\mathrm{ac}}(H_{F,\alpha})=\mathbb R$ by transferring a strict Mourre estimate from the free Stark operator and by the compactness of the boundary coupling. Resonances are defined by complex distortion in the field direction and characterized as zeros of a boundary regularized Fredholm determinant. In $d=3$ and small $F$, bound states at $F=0$ continue to resonances with widths of order $\exp(-c/F)$, governed by an Agmon--type distance. A brief comparison with the free Stark case is also given.</description>

      <title>A gauge theory of complex adaptive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric construction of a gauge field theory of a complex adaptive system. It is based on a suitable simplicial formulation of a discrete geometry that manifests relevant properties valid in the classical differentiable case. Bundles' non-triviality naturally arises from local collective interactions between agents. Key elements of the theory of principal and associated bundles, such as local obstructions for triviality and characteristic classes, are opportunely defined in this context. Complexity is modelled as the result of local and topological obstructions for the triviality of these geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity and a refined index for 2d invertible phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</description>

      <title>A Calogero Model with root string representatives of infinite order Coxeter orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a worked example for the new extensions of the multi-particle Calogero model endowed with infinite Weyl group symmetry of affine and hyperbolic type. Building upon the hyperbolic extension of the $A_3$-Kac-Moody algebra, we construct an explicit realisation of the model in terms of infinite root systems generated from Coxeter orbits. To address the challenge of summing over infinitely many roots, we introduce root string representatives that span the invariant root space while preserving invariance under the affine Weyl group. This approach yields closed-form expressions for the potentials, which by construction are invariant under the full affine Weyl symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that in an appropriate infinite-coordinate limit the model reduces smoothly to the conventional four particle $A_3$-Calogero system. Our construction constitutes a systematic method for implementing infinite-dimensional symmetries into Calogero-type models, thus broadening their algebraic and physical applicability.</description>

      <title>Wave-number lock-in in buckled elastic structures: an analogue to parametric instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric instabilities are a known feature of periodically driven dynamic systems; at particular frequencies and amplitudes of the driving modulation, the system's quasi-periodic response undergoes a frequency lock-in, leading to a periodically unstable response. Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic lightcones in the multiparticle Anderson model with sparse interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the dynamics of the one-dimensional $ XY $ model with random magnetic field perturbed by a sparse set of $ ZZ $ terms with a large coupling constant $ \Delta $ gives rise to Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bounds with a logarithmic lightcone and amplitude proportional to $ \Delta^{-1} $. These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative.</description>

      <title>On the connection between Bochner's theorem on positive definite maps and Choi theorem on complete positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a connection between Bochner's theorem on positive definite maps and Choi theorem on complete positivity. We begin by defining a convolution product between maps from the contracted semigroup algebra $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ of a semigroup $S$ to an arbitrary associative algebra $\mathcal{A}$. The convolution product makes the space $L(\mathbb{C}_0[S],\mathcal{A})$ of linear maps from $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ to $\mathcal{A}$ an associative algebra. We prove that the convolution algebra $L(\mathbb{C}_0[S],\mathcal{A})$ and the tensor product algebra $\mathbb{C}_0[S] \otimes \mathcal{A}$ are isomorphic. As a consequence, in the specific case of the inverse semigroup of matrix units, we identify the product in the space of maps on the matrix algebras which is preserved by the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism as convolution. Then, by defining the Fourier transform of a map from $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ to $M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we derive the Fourier inversion formula when $S$ is a finite inverse semigroup. As a corollary of this formula, we show that in the case of the inverse semigroup of matrix units, the Fourier transformation of a map with respect to the identity representation becomes the Choi matrix of the map and the Fourier inversion formula becomes the Choi inversion formula. Then, by defining the notion of matrix valued positive definite maps, we prove Bochner's theorem in the context of finite inverse semigroup. It is demonstrated that Bochner's theorem reduces to Choi theorem on completely positive maps when the inverse semigroup of matrix units is considered. Additionally, the necessary and sufficient condition on a representation $\rho:M_m \to M_{d_{\rho}}(\mathbb{C})$ such that the Complete positivity vs. positivity correspondence holds between a linear map $\Phi: M_m(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ and its Fourier Transform $\widehat{\Phi}(\rho)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Constitutive properties for isotropic energies in ideal nonlinear elasticity for solid materials: numerical evidences for invertibility and monotonicity in different stress-strain pairs</title>

Abstract: As a service for the solid mechanics community we gather in this paper constitutive properties of a collective list of isotropic elastic energies for compressible materials. Of interest to us are the invertibility and monotonicity of certain stress-strain pairs. The calculations are done numerically by our own evaluation algorithm and presented in a yes/no-table. Such an overview has been missing up to now. It is intended to expand the table with further energies as time goes on and updates will be found on arxive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In teleparallelism one is able to tackle the gravitational energy and angular momentum problems in a way that distinguishes this theory from other theories of gravity, such as general relativity. However, unlike the $4$-momentum, the quantity that is usually identified with a type of angular momentum does not have a clear interpretation. This problem is discussed, in particular the vanishing of the $3$-angular momentum in the time gauge, and some general properties are obtained.</description>

      <title>Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudhana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the ordering within the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and macroscopic biaxiality.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative Ruelle's Theorem for a normalized potential taking values on positivity-improving operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a finite-dimensional real (or complex) C*-algebra, \(\Omega_{A}\) an aperiodic subshift of finite type, and \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\) the set of continuous functions from \(\Omega_{A}\) to \(\mathcal{A}\). The shift $\sigma$ provides dynamics. Given a real Lipschitz potential $\varphi\in \mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of linear operators acting on a real $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce a noncommutative analogue of Ruelle's operator, which acts on \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\). Assuming the positivity-improving hypothesis, we prove a version of Ruelle's Theorem whenever the operator is normalized. An eigenstate (a linear functional) invariant for the action of the noncommutative Ruelle's operator will play the role of the Gibbs probability of Thermodynamic Formalism; to be called a Gibbs eigenstate. We introduce the concept of entropy for a Gibbs eigenstate (obtained from a certain family of potentials $\varphi$) - generalizing the classical one. In our setting, there is currently no direct relationship with cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We present examples illustrating the novelty of the cases that can be considered, ranging from topics related to quantum channels to Pauli matrices. Interesting cases: $\mathcal{A}=M_{N \times N}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathcal{A}= \mathbb{R}^{N}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

Abstract: We present a purely geometric and exact description of the interior dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of charges beyond its total mass ${\cal M}$. Its dynamical evolution gives rise to new singularities absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Origin of the power-law profile in a core-collapsing galactic globular-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed galactic globular clusters reveal power-law structural profiles in the inner halos around the core-collapse stage. However, the origin of the power-law has not been explained in an acceptable manner. The present paper applies the Buckingham's Pi theorem to the orbit-averaged Fokker-Plank (OAFP) model of equal masses to study the inner-halo structure of a core-collapsing isotropic star cluster. We first prove that an infinite OAFP model evolves self-similarly because of the principle of covariance. We then show that the inner halo must form a power-law profile in a finite OAFP model that has complete similarity so that the principle of covariance and conservation laws hold. The conventional assumption that inner halos are self-similar and stationary is unnecessary to explain the power-law profiles.</description>

      <title>Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4 percent of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20 percent of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <title>The Teukolsky scalar as a gateway for quantizing gravity on rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantization of linearized gravity on black hole spacetimes and the construction of states for that theory is a sought-after, yet difficult achievement. One of the main reasons is the difficulty of reconciling the positivity and gauge invariance of potential states. On Kerr spacetimes, the spin-2 Teukolsky scalars express the same degrees of freedom as the metric perturbations, up to pure gauge and radiative solutions, while avoiding the issue of gauge. In this work, we therefore explore the quantization of Teukolsky scalars on Kerr. We demonstrate that the theory can be written in terms of a formally hermitian Green-hyperbolic operator, allowing the construction of the algebra of observables. The reconstruction scheme for the metric perturbation allows us to keep track of the physical subalgebra. We indicate how this can be used to construct the Unruh state for this theory on any subextreme Kerr spacetime. This is based on a joint work with Dietrich H\"afner in preparation.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

      <title>Duality of extremal quantum states in verification and data hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state verification (QSV) and quantum data hiding (QDH) have so far been studied separately. QSV decides whether a given quantum state is close to the ideal one, with significantly lower sample complexity compared with direct application of quantum tomography. On the other hand, QDH is a cryptographic protocol that encodes secret classical information in multipartite quantum states, providing stronger security guarantees than conventional classical secret-sharing schemes. Here, we consider two fundamental quantities of a pure quantum state, determining the sample complexity needed for QSV or the security level in QDH. We demonstrate that a pure state is most difficult to verify in QSV if and only if it is most secure in QDH with respect to those quantities. Furthermore, for such extremal states, the two fundamental quantities coincide. We also generalize this relationship to one between the security of QDH using mixed states and the sample complexity for quantum subspace verification, which is a generalization of QSV. As an application, we show the existence of efficient QSV protocols that are generalizations of the existing ones and examine the fundamental limitations on QDH by synthesizing research from both domains.</description>

      <title>Globally aware optimization with resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$ landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition functions encode precise information about all critical objective function value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$, extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers, enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded in the geometry of the optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS hypermultiplets in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -6 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x_5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries are a central concept in our understanding of physics. In quantum theories, a quantum reference frame (QRF) can be used to distinguish between observables related by a symmetry. The framework of operational QRFs provides a means to describe observables in terms of their relation to a reference quantum system. We discuss a number of applications of QRFs in the context of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes: 1) A type reduction result for algebras arising from QFTs and QRFs with good thermal properties. 2) Quantisation of boundary electric fluxes and gluing procedures for quantum electromagnetism on spacetimes with boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of generalized hypergeometric integrals defined on punctured Riemann surfaces of genus g. These integrals are closely related to g-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting, where one leaves the loop-momenta, moduli and all but one puncture un-integrated. We study the twisted homology groups associated to these integrals, and determine their intersection numbers. We make use of these homology intersection numbers to write a double-copy formula for the "complex" version of these integrals -- their closed-string analogues. To verify our findings, we develop numerical tools for the evaluation of the integrals in this work. This includes the recently introduced Enriquez kernels -- integration kernels for higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier duality introduces a well-known non-invertible symmetry in the critical transverse-field Ising model. In this work, we extend this concept to a broad class of quantum lattice models induced from integrability, providing explicit expressions for the Kramers-Wannier operators that can be systematically computed.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Energy Ising Machine Leveraging Difference-of-Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

      <title>Rigorous Modeling of Droplet Impact Dynamics on Micro-Structured Surfaces: Nonlocal Theory and SPH Simulation of Pancake Bouncing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct rigorous mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the metastable behavior of the long-range Ising model on random regular graphs under Glauber dynamics at low-temperature. We estimate the energy barrier and exit time from the metastable state using a nontrivial path-wise approach that explicitly accounts for the spatial decay of the interactions and the structural properties of the graph, such as the Cheeger constant and known estimates of the diameter. Our results generalize those of Dommers \cite{dommers2017metastability} for the short-range case, providing a unified framework for understanding metastability in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical theory of spin structures, we develop a theory for lifting free C$^*$-dynamical systems, a.k.a. noncommutative principal bundles, along central extensions. This theory extends the bundle-theoretic notion of spin structures and yields a complete existence and classification result for such lifts. Using factor system techniques and Picard formalism, our approach introduces new invariants and obstruction classes, thereby unifying geometric, cohomological, and operator-algebraic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Operator Algebras and Third Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, the gravitational path integral involves a sum over topologies, representing the joining and splitting of multiple universes. To account for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation of closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or universe field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare event, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally described by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible for the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form factor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this universality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes is captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open universes calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We propose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which takes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum system and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on its symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the coherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics. The multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby universes, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum field theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization. In the Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity, the universal Poisson process reproduces the late-time correlators in the $\tau$-scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust optimisation framework for computing invariant solutions of wall-bounded flows by recasting the Navier-Stokes equations as a variational problem as established in Ashtari and Schneider, JFM (2023). The approach minimises the residual of the governing equations over a finite time horizon, seeking periodic or equilibrium solutions. A novel contribution is made by including a Galerkin projection onto a basis of divergence-free modes that satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions. This projection not only makes the variational framework applicable to wall-bounded flows but it also yields a low-order representation of the dynamics. The basis is derived from resolvent analysis, which provides an orthonormal set. We demonstrate the method on a 2D3C formulation of rotating plane Couette flow, obtaining exact equilibrium and periodic solutions consistent with direct numerical simulations. The conditioning of the optimisation problem is analysed in detail, showing that convergence rates depend on the stability properties of the targeted solutions. Finally, we highlight a direct link between the conditioning of the optimisation and the structure of the resolvent operator, suggesting a unifying perspective on both the efficiency of the optimisation and the dynamical significance of resolvent modes.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of radially symmetric Coulomb gas ensembles at inverse temperature $\beta=2$, for which the droplet consists of a number of concentric annuli, having at least one bounded ``gap'' $G$, i.e., a connected component of the complement of the droplet, which disconnects the droplet. Let $n$ be the total number of particles. Among other things, we deduce fine asymptotics as $n \to \infty$ for the edge density and the correlation kernel near the gap, as well as for the cumulant generating function of fluctuations of smooth linear statistics. We typically find an oscillatory behaviour in the distribution of particles which fall near the edge of the gap. These oscillations are given explicitly in terms of a discrete Gaussian distribution, weighted Szeg\H{o} kernels, and the Jacobi theta function, which depend on the parameter $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a spectral curve with exponential singularities (which we call a "transalgebraic spectral curve"), we extend the definition of topological recursion to include contributions from the exponential singularities in a way that is compatible with limits of sequences of spectral curves. This allows us to prove the topological recursion/quantum curve correspondence for a large class of transalgebraic spectral curves. As an application, we find that Atlantes Hurwitz numbers, which were previously thought to fall outside the scope of topological recursion, satisfy (our extended version of) topological recursion, and we construct the corresponding quantum curve directly from topological recursion.</description>

Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <title>Propagators in curved spacetimes from operator theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss two distinct operator-theoretic settings useful for describing (or defining) propagators associated with a scalar Klein-Gordon field on a Lorentzian manifold $M$. Typically, we assume that $M$ is globally hyperbolic. The term propagator here refers to any Green function or bisolution of the Klein-Gordon equation pertinent to Quantum Field Theory.
  The off-shell setting is based on the Hilbert space $L^2(M)$. It leads to the definition of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagators, which often coincide with the so-called in-out Feynman and out-in anti-Feynman propagator. On some special spacetimes, the sum of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagator equals the sum of the forward and backward propagator. This is always true on static stable spacetimes and, curiously, in some other cases as well.
  The on-shell setting is based on the Krein space $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$ of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. It allows us to define 2-point functions associated to two, possibly distinct, Fock states as the Klein-Gordon kernels of projectors onto maximal uniformly positive subspaces of $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$.
  After a general discussion, we review a number of examples. We start with static and asymptotically static spacetimes, which are especially well-suited for Quantum Field Theory. Then we discuss FLRW spacetimes, reducible by a mode decomposition to 1-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators. We compare various approaches to de Sitter space where, curiously, the off-shell approach gives non-physical propagators. Finally, we discuss the universal cover of anti-de Sitter spaces, where the on-shell approach may require boundary conditions, unlike the off-shell approach.</description>

      <title>On the perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators with separate resonant embedded eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Schr\"odinger operators on $L^2(0,\infty)$ given by
  \begin{align}
  Hu=(H_0+V)u=-u^{\prime\prime}+V_0u+Vu,\nonumber
  \end{align}
  where $V_0$ is real, $1$-periodic and $V$ is the perturbation. It is well known that under perturbations $V(x)=o(1)$ as $x\to\infty$, the essential spectrum of $H$ coincides with the essential spectrum of $H_0$. We introduce a new way to construct oscillatory decaying perturbations with resonant embedded eigenvalues. Given any at most countable set $S$ inside the essential spectrum, we can construct perturbations with $S$ contained in the set of eigenvalues if the resonant eigenvalues in $S$ satisfy some condition. In particular, if $S$ is a finite set (or countable set), we can construct perturbation with $V(x)=\frac{O(1)}{x}$ $\left(\mathrm{or}\ \abs{V(x)}\leq\frac{h(x)}{1+x}\right)$ as $x\to\infty$ if the resonant eigenvalues of $S$ appear in the same spectral bands or large separate spectral bands, where $h(x)$ is any given function with $\lim_{x\to\infty}h(x)=\infty$.</description>

      <title>Bethe roots for periodic TASEP and algebraic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algebraic method for solving the Bethe ansatz equations for the periodic totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with an arbitrary number of sites and particles. The Bethe ansatz equations are realized as an algebraic equation on a certain Riemann surface. While our Riemann surface is essentially the same as the one introduced by Prolhac, we focus on its algebraic realization as a (singular) plane curve. Through a counting argument on the Riemann surface, we establish a rigorous proof that the Bethe ansatz equation has the expected number of solutions when counted with multiplicity. Consequently, under appropriate generic conditions, the completeness of the Bethe ansatz follows. The decomposition of the Riemann surface into connected components determines how often each value of the product of Bethe roots appears. We classify the connected components and their multiplicities using a similar argument to the spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix discussed by Golinelli-Mallick. As a result, we give an algebro-geometric characterization of Golinelli-Mallick-type spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix. We also give explicit formulas for the number of connected components, the number of ramification points, and the total genus of the Riemann surface. These formulas recover the table of examples presented by Prolhac. Moreover, we explore applications of the special type of Bethe roots that appear in this case to partition functions of the five-vertex model. We introduce a version of the free energy and evaluate the thermodynamic limit to find the explicit form in terms of the Riemann zeta function.</description>

Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>

      <title>An explanation of the number or points and symmetries of starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starbursts are the light intensity patterns seen when small bright sources are looked at night, typically stars. Starburst shapes are produced when the presence of the eye's wave aberrations generates caustics (light concentration) at the retina. A fascinating, but never explained fact about starbursts is that they usually present a $p$-fold symmetry pattern. We provide a theoretical explanation of the number of points and symmetries of starbursts, based on the geometric and algebraic properties of the wave aberration function expressed as a Zernike polynomial expansion. Specifically, we investigate the number and distribution of saddle cusps of Gauss of the Hessian of the wave aberration function. We also establish the connections between those points with the symmetries and the number of starburst points. We found that starbursts are likely generated by axially symmetric dominated wave aberrations with some amount of non-axially symmetric terms. For instance, whereas a wave aberration with a dominant spherical aberration (Zernike polynomial $Z_4^{0}$) plus $Z_3^{3}$ may induce a $3$ points starburst with a $3$-fold symmetry, a wave aberration combining $Z_4^{0}$ and $Z_4^{4}$ may induce a $4$-fold symmetry starburst with $4$ or $8$ points.</description>

      <title>Integrable multispecies totally asymmetric stochastic interacting particle systems with homogeneous rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one dimensional stochastic particle systems with exclusion interaction that each site can be occupied by at most one particle, and homogeneous jumping rates. Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models.</description>

      <title>On topological obstructions to the existence of non-periodic Wannier bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, M. Ludewig and G. C. Thiang introduced a notion of a uniformly localized Wannier basis with localization centers in an arbitrary uniformly discrete subset $D$ in a complete Riemannian manifold $X$. They show that, under certain geometric conditions on $X$, the class of the orthogonal projection onto the span of such a Wannier basis in the $K$-theory of the Roe algebra $C^*(X)$ is trivial. In this paper, we clarify the geometric conditions on $X$, which guarantee triviality of the $K$-theory class of any Wannier projection. We show that this property is equivalent to triviality of the unit of the uniform Roe algebra of $D$ in the $K$-theory of its Roe algebra, and provide a geometric criterion for that. As a consequence, we prove triviality of the $K$-theory class of any Wannier projection on a connected proper measure space $X$ of bounded geometry with a uniformly discrete set of localization centers.</description>

      <title>Towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics from a gas of interacting wave packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present steps towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics in quantum integrable models, starting from the Bethe wave functions, and explained on the example of the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This includes an identification of the generalised hydrodynamics quasi-particles as wave packets in the quantum model. These wave packets evolve according to a classical particle model and collect two-particle scattering shifts similar to solitons in integrable PDEs. We then discuss potential routes to obtain the generalised hydrodynamics equation for average conserved densities in long-wavelength states from this description. As part of this, we provide an explicit formula for the action of the spectral phase-space density operator on Bethe wave functions, and show that it generates local conserved densities.</description>

      <title>Optimal divergence rate of the focusing Gibbs measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with $L^2$-(super)critical focusing interaction potentials. We establish a precise divergence rate of the partition function as we remove regularization, where the optimal constant is given by (i) (the negative of) the minimum value of the Hamiltonian given an $L^2$-constraint in the $L^2$-critical case and (ii) the optimal constant for certain Bernstein's inequality in the mass-supercritical case. In particular, our result in the $L^2$-critical case precisely quantifies the phase transition of the focusing Gibbs measure at the critical $L^2$ threshold, previously studied by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) and Sosoe, Tolomeo, and the fourth author (2022).</description>

      <title>Free energy and fluctuations in the random normal matrix model with spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study large $n$ expansions for the partition function of a Coulomb gas $$Z_n=\frac 1 {\pi^n}\int_{\mathbb{C}^n}\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}|z_i-z_j|^2\prod_{i=1}^n e^{-nQ(z_i)}\, d^2 z_i,$$ where $Q$ is a radially symmetric confining potential on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$.
  The droplet is not assumed to be connected, but may consist of a number of disjoint connected annuli and possibly a central disk. The boundary condition is ``soft edge'', i.e., $Q$ is smooth in a $\mathbb{C}$-neighbourhood of the droplet.
  We include the following possibilities: (i) existence of ``outposts'', i.e., components of the coincidence set which falls outside of the droplet, (ii) a conical (or Fisher-Hartwig) singularity at the origin, (iii) perturbations $Q-\frac h n$ where $h$ is a smooth radially symmetric test-function.
  In each case, the free energy $\log Z_n$ admits a large $n$ expansion of the form \begin{equation*}\log Z_n=C_1n^2+C_2n\log n+C_3 n+C_4\log n+C_5+\mathcal{G}_{n}+o(1)\end{equation*} where $C_1,\ldots,C_5$ are certain geometric functionals. The $n$-dependent term $\mathcal{G}_n$ is bounded as $n\to\infty$; it arises in the presence of spectral gaps.
  We use the free energy expansions to study the distribution of fluctuations of linear statistics. We prove that the fluctuations are well approximated by the sum of a Gaussian and certain independent terms which provide the displacement of particles from one component to another. This displacement depends on $n$ and is expressed in terms of the Heine distribution. We also prove (under suitable assumptions) that the number of particles which fall near a spectral outpost converges to a Heine distribution.</description>

Abstract: We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on $\Z$ with step initial condition and with the presence of a rightward-moving wall that prevents the particles from jumping. This model was first studied in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'21]. We extend their work by determining the limiting distribution of a tagged particle in the case where the wall has influence on its fluctuations in neighbourhoods of multiple macroscopic times.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond approximation schemes. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. The evaluation of path integral reduces to determining the quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions (which can be achieved via an asymptotic analysis), and a discrete sum over the quantum period lattice, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for one-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators, stability of Anderson localization under a class of rank one perturbations implies absence of intervals in spectra. The argument is based on well-known result of Gordon and del Rio--Makarov--Simon, combined with a way to consider perturbations whose ranges are not necessarily cyclic. The main application of the results is showing that a class of quasiperiodic operators with sawtooth-like potentials, for which such a version of stable localization is known, has Cantor spectra. We also obtain several results on gap filling under rank one perturbations for some general (not necessarily monotone) classes of quasiperiodic operators with discontinuous potentials.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a perturbative proof of localization for quasiperiodic operators on $\ell^2(\Z^d)$ with one-dimensional phase space and monotone sampling functions, in the regime of small hopping. The proof is based on an iterative scheme which can be considered as a local (in the energy and the phase) and convergent version of KAM-type diagonalization, whose result is a covariant family of uniformly localized eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We also proof that the spectra of such operators contain infinitely many gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the hot spots conjecture for a class of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are a natural generalization of the lip domains of Atar and Burdzy [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 17 (2004), 243-265] in dimension two, as well as for a class of symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generalizing the domains studied by Jerison and Nadirashvili [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 13 (2000), 741-772]. Our method of proof is based on studying a vector-valued Laplace operator whose spectrum contains the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian. This proof is essentially variational and does not require tools from stochastic analysis, nor does it use deformation arguments. In particular, it contains a new proof of the main result of Jerison and Nadirashvili.</description>

      <title>A vanishing theorem in $K$-theory for spectral projections of a non-periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu) = \nabla_{\bf A}^*\nabla_{\bf A} + \mu V$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry, where $\mu&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter, the magnetic field ${\bf B}=d{\bf A}$ and the electric potential $V$ are uniformly $C^\infty$-bounded, $V\geq 0$. We assume that, for some $E_0&gt;0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $\{V&lt;E_0\}$ of the potential $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that, for sufficiently large $\mu$, the spectrum of $H(\mu)$ in the interval $[0,E_0\mu]$ has a gap, the spectral projection of $H(\mu)$, corresponding to the interval $(-\infty,\lambda]$ with $\lambda$ in the gap, belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C^*(M)$ of the manifold $M$, and, if $M$ is not compact, its class in the $K$ theory of $C^*(M)$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>The 3BF theory as a TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a countable discrete amenable group, we study conditions under which a set map into a Banach space (or more generally, a complete semi-normed space) can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation, such that the realization is asymptotically indistinguishable from the original map. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps, extending previous work for sequences in Banach spaces and on the case of a single non-expansive linear map. Additionally, we develop a relative version of this characterization, identifying when the additive realization can be chosen within a prescribed target set. As an application, our results generalize central aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the additive and asymptotically additive frameworks.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called polynomial ensembles and its subclass P\'olya ensembles. This latter subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the eigenvalue (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <title>Non-modal effects in black hole perturbation theory: Transient Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by using Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem to obtain new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere-packing bound quantifies the error exponent for noisy channel coding for rates above a critical value. Here, we study the zero-rate limit of the sphere-packing bound and show that it has an intriguing single-letter form, which we call the umlaut information of the channel, inspired by the lautum information introduced by Palomar and Verd\'u. Unlike the latter quantity, we show that the umlaut information is additive for parallel uses of channels. We show that it has a twofold operational interpretation: as the zero-rate error exponent of non-signalling-assisted coding on the one hand, and as the zero-rate error exponent of list decoding in the large list limit on the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified free field realization of representations for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ with arbitrary levels, constructed using six free boson fields. This realization arises from a specialized factorization of the structure function within the defining relations of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$. Utilizing this free field realization, we further develop intertwining operators for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subcomodule of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) admit non-equivariant limits. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators.
  As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry.
  We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the modules over the internal skein algebras are generated by one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Correlators in Finite Rigid Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article applies to the open-closed sector and generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients obtained by the evaluation of the torus partition function at projective objects are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</description>

      <title>Spectral flow and application to unitarity of representations of minimal $W$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spectral flow, we provide a proof of [9, Theorem 9.17] on unitarity of Ramond twisted non-extremal representations of minimal $W$-algebras that does not rely on the still conjectural exactness of the twisted quantum reduction functor (see Conjecture 9.11 of [9]). When $\mathfrak g=spo(2|2n)$, $F(4)$, $D(2,1;\frac{m}{n})$, it is also proven that the unitarity of extremal (=massless) representations of the minimal $W$-algebra $W^k_{\min}(\mathfrak g)$ in the Ramond sector is equivalent to the unitarity of extremal representations in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.
  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>On a Super-analogue of Carrollian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Carrollian geometry, we define super-Carrollian manifolds as a supermanifold with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion. As a physically relevant example, we show how a super-Carrollian manifold can be constructed from standard superspace $\mathbb{R}^{4|4}$ via an In\"on\"u--Wigner contraction.</description>

      <title>A new spin on polynomial relations among kappa classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of the fourth named author with P. Norbury that states a system of universal polynomial relations among the kappa classes on the moduli spaces of algebraic curves. The proof involves localization and materialization analysis of the spin Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line and is dictated by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant topological recursion.</description>
