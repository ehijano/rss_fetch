      <title>Measuring Financial Resilience Using Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the resilience rate as a measure of financial resilience. It captures the expected rate at which a dynamic risk evaluation recovers, i.e., bounces back, after the risk-acceptance set is breached. We develop the corresponding stochastic calculus by establishing representation theorems for a suitable time-derivative of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps evaluated at stopping times. These results reveal that our resilience rate can be represented as an expectation of the generator of a BSDE. We analyze the properties of the resilience rate. We also introduce resilience-acceptance sets and study their properties in relation to both the resilience rate and the dynamic risk measure. We illustrate our results in several examples.</description>

      <title>Unwinding Stochastic Order Flow: When to Warehouse Trades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to unwind stochastic order flow with minimal transaction costs. Stochastic order flow arises, e.g., in the central risk book (CRB), a centralized trading desk that aggregates order flows within a financial institution. The desk can warehouse in-flow orders, ideally netting them against subsequent opposite orders (internalization), or route them to the market (externalization) and incur costs related to price impact and bid-ask spread. We model and solve this problem for a general class of in-flow processes, enabling us to study in detail how in-flow characteristics affect optimal strategy and core trading metrics. Our model allows for an analytic solution in semi-closed form and is readily implementable numerically. Compared with a standard execution problem where the order size is known upfront, the unwind strategy exhibits an additive adjustment for projected future in-flows. Its sign depends on the autocorrelation of orders; only truth-telling (martingale) flow is unwound myopically. In addition to analytic results, we present extensive simulations for different use cases and regimes, and introduce new metrics of practical interest.</description>
