      <title>Bad Foundations and Manipulable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine a student -- let's call him `E', and make him a "he" -- that is enrolled in Calculus 2, and who believes that to pass in maths courses he only needs to memorize methods and apply them quickly and without errors. Let's imagine that `E' is an `E'xtreme case of "bad foundations" and that he knows how to solve $x+2=5$ by doing $x=5-2=3$, but he doesn't know how to substitute the $x$ in $x+2=5$ by 3, and the only way that he knows of "testing the solution" is to apply the same method again and check that he got the same result.
  When we are teaching Calculus to classes that have many students that are extreme cases of bad foundations we need new strategies and tools; for example, we can't pretend that "taking a particular case" is an obvious operation anymore -- instead we need ways to make these operations easy to visualize. This article shows a way to do that using Maxima.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and analytic structure of Morikawa's sangaku problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu(r)$ denote the minimal side length of a square inscribed in the curvilinear triangular region formed by two tangent circles of radii $1$ and $r \ge 1$ together with their common tangent line. The problem of finding a closed-form expression for $\mu(r)$ was posed in early nineteenth-century Japan by Morikawa. It was proved by Holly and Krumm (2021) that no expression in radicals exists for $\mu(r)$. In this article we show that $\mu$ is an algebraic function, and consequently real-analytic on $[1,\infty)$ outside a finite explicitly computable set. In particular, although no expression in radicals exists, the function admits convergent Taylor expansions at all non-exceptional values of $r$, whose coefficients may be computed by Newton iteration from the defining algebraic equation. We illustrate the method by explicitly computing the Taylor expansion of $\mu(r)$ centered at $r=1$.</description>
