      <title>Extended (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras as companion structures of extended Rota-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the common theme of splitting of operations, the notions of (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras have attracted sustained attention with broad applications. An important aspect of their studies is as the derived structures of Rota-Baxter operators on associative or Lie algebras. This paper introduces extended versions of (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras, and post-Lie algebras, establishing close relations among these new structures that generalize those among their classical counterparts. These new structures can be derived from the extended Rota-Baxter operator, which combines the standard Rota-Baxter operator and the modified Rota-Baxter operator. To characterize these new notions as the derived structures of extended Rota-Baxter algebras, we define the binary quadratic operad in companion with an operad with nontrivial unary operations. Then the extended (tri)dendriform algebra is shown to be the binary quadratic nonsymmetric operads in companion to the operad of extended Rota-Baxter algebras. As a key ingredient in achieving this and for its own right, the free extended Rota-Baxter algebra is constructed by bracketed words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that subhomogeneous continuous Banach bundles over compact metrizable spaces are equivalent to Hilbert bundles, while examples show that the metrizability assumption cannot be dropped completely. This complements the parallel statement for homogeneous bundles without the metrizability assumption, and generalizes the analogous result to the effect that subhomogeneous $C^*$ bundles over compact metrizable spaces admit finite-index expectations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Correct Sorting in Cubical Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper "Sorting with Bialgebras and Distributive Laws" by Hinze et al. uses the framework of bialgebraic semantics to define sorting algorithms. From distributive laws between functors they construct pairs of sorting algorithms using both folds and unfolds. Pairs of sorting algorithms arising this way include insertion/selection sort and quick/tree sort.
  We extend this work to define intrinsically correct variants in cubical Agda. Our key idea is to index our data types by multisets, which concisely captures that a sorting algorithm terminates with an ordered permutation of its input list. By lifting bialgebraic semantics to the indexed setting, we obtain the correctness of sorting algorithms purely from the distributive law.</description>

      <title>Colimits in 2-dimensional slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize to dimension 2 the well-known fact that a colimit in a 1-dimensional slice is precisely the map from the colimit of the domains of the diagram that is induced by the universal property. For this, we find the need to reduce weighted 2-colimits to cartesian-marked oplax conical ones, and as a consequence the need to consider lax slices. We prove results of preservation, reflection and lifting of 2-colimits for the domain 2-functor from a lax slice. We thus generalize to dimension 2 the whole fruitful calculus of colimits in 1-dimensional slices. We achieve this within the framework of enhanced (or F-)category theory. The preservation result assumes products in the base 2-category and uses an original general theorem which states that a lax left adjoint preserves appropriate 2-colimits if the adjunction is strict on one side and suitably F-categorical. Finally, we apply the same general theorem of preservation of 2-colimits to the 2-functor of change of base along a split Grothendieck opfibration between lax slices. We prove that this change of base 2-functor is indeed a left adjoint of the kind described above by laxifying the proof that Conduch\'{e} functors are exponentiable. We conclude extending the result of preservation of 2-colimits for the change of base 2-functor to any finitely complete 2-category with a dense generator.</description>

      <title>Constructing monoidal structures on fibered categories via factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a small category, and suppose that we are given two (non-full) subcategories $\mathcal{S}^{sm}$ and $\mathcal{S}^{cl}$ that generate all morphisms of $\mathcal{S}$ under composition in the same way as morphisms of quasi-projective algebraic varieties are generated by smooth morphisms and closed immersions. We show that a monoidal structure on a given $\mathcal{S}$-fibered category is completely determined by its restrictions to $\mathcal{S}^{sm}$ and $\mathcal{S}^{cl}$; in fact, any such pair of monoidal structures satisfying a natural coherence condition uniquely determines a monoidal structure over $\mathcal{S}$. The same principle applies to morphisms of $\mathcal{S}$-fibered categories and monoidality thereof. Under further assumptions on the subcategories $\mathcal{S}^{sm}$ and $\mathcal{S}^{cl}$, and with suitable restrictions on the $\mathcal{S}$-fibered categories and morphisms involved, we provide a variant of the above factorization method in which inverse images under closed immersion are partially replaced by the corresponding direct images: the latter variant is more adapted to the setting of perverse sheaves.</description>

      <title>Extending monoidal structures on fibered categories via embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a small category, and suppose that we are given a full subcategory $\mathcal{U}$ such that every object of $\mathcal{S}$ can be embedded into some object of $\mathcal{U}$ in the same way as every quasi-projective algebraic variety admits a closed embedding into a smooth one. We show that every monoidal structure on a given $\mathcal{S}$-fibered category satisfying certain natural conditions is completely determined by its restriction to $\mathcal{U}$; in fact, any monoidal structure over $\mathcal{U}$ satisfying similar natural conditions admits an essentially unique extension to the whole of $\mathcal{S}$. For instance, this allows one to recover the unit constraint on the classical constructible derived categories from the abelian categories of perverse sheaves. The same principle applies to morphisms of $\mathcal{S}$-fibered categories and monoidality thereof.</description>

      <title>Traces for factorization homology in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a circle-invariant trace from the factorization homology of the circle $ {\sf trace} \colon \int^\alpha_{{\mathbb S}^1} \\underline{\sf End}(V) \longrightarrow \uno $ associated to a dualizable object $V\in {\boldsymbol{\mathfrak X}}$ in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. This proves a conjecture of To\"en--Vezzosi on existence of circle-invariant traces. Underlying our construction is a calculation of the factorization homology over the circle of the walking adjunction in terms of the paracyclic category of Getzler--Jones: $ \int_{{\mathbb S}^1} {\sf Adj} ~\simeq~ {\bDelta_{\circlearrowleft}}^{\triangleleft\!\triangleright} ~. $ This calculation exhibits a form of Poincar\'e duality for 1-dimensional factorization homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the "official" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions.

      <description>arXiv:2211.12370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that various combinatorial invariants of matroids such as Chow rings and Orlik--Solomon algebras may be assembled into "operad-like" structures. Specifically, one obtains several operads over a certain Feynman category which we introduce and study in detail. In addition, we establish a Koszul-type duality between Chow rings and Orlik--Solomon algebras, vastly generalizing a celebrated result of Getzler. This provides a new interpretation of combinatorial Leray models of Orlik--Solomon algebras.</description>

      <title>Gluing algebraic quantum field theories on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that, given an algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) on a manifold $M$ and an open cover $\{M_\alpha\}$ of $M$, it is typically not possible to recover the global algebra of observables on $M$ by simply gluing the underlying local algebras subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$. Instead of gluing local algebras, we introduce a gluing construction for AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ and we show that for simple examples of AQFTs, constructed out of geometric data, gluing the local AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ recovers the global AQFT on $M$.</description>

      <title>A duality for the class of compact $T_1$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a contravariant adjunction between compact $T_1$-spaces and a class of distributive lattices which recomprises key portions of Stone's duality and of Isbell's duality among its instantiations. This brings us to focus on $T_1$-spaces, rather than sober spaces, and to identify points in them with minimal prime filters on some base for a $T_1$-topology (which is what Stone's duality does on the base of clopen sets of compact $0$-dimensional spaces), in spite of completely prime filters on the topology (which is what Isbell's duality does on a sober space).
  More precisely our contravariant adjunction produces a contravariant, faithful and full embedding of the category of compact $T_1$-spaces with arrows given by closed continuous map as a reflective subcategory of a category $\mathsf{SbfL} $ whose objects are the bounded distributive lattices isomorphic to some base of a $T_1$-topological space (e.g. subfits, when the lattices are frames) and whose arrows are given by (what we call) set-like-morphisms (a natural class of morphisms characterized by a first order expressible constraint).
  Furthermore this contravariant adjunction becomes a duality when one restricts on the topological side to the category of compact $T_2$-spaces with arbitrary continuous maps, and on the lattice-theoretic side to the category of compact, complete, and normal lattices.
  A nice by-product of the above results is a lattice-theoretic reformulation of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification theorem which we have not been able to trace elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>On The Telescopic Picard Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any prime $p$ and height $n \ge 1$, the telescopic Picard group $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathrm{Sp}_{Tn})$ contains a subgroup of the form $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}/a_p(p^n-1)$, where $a_p = 1$ if $p = 2$ and $a_p = 2$ if $p$ is odd. Using Kummer theory, we obtain an $(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^\times \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/n)$-Galois extension of $\mathbb{S}_{T(n)}$, obtaining the first example of a lift of a non-Abelian Galois extension of the $K(n)$-local sphere to the telescopic world, at arbitrary positive height and prime. Our proof proceeds by setting up a higher categorical framework for the periodicity theorem, utilizing the symmetries of this framework to construct Picard elements.</description>
