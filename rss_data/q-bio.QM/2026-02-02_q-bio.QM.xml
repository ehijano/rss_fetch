      <title>Microbiome association diversity reflects proximity to the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in metagenomics have revealed macroecological patterns or "laws" describing robust statistical regularities across microbial communities. Stochastic logistic models (SLMs), which treat species as independent -- akin to ideal gases in physics -- and incorporate environmental noise, reproduce many single-species patterns but cannot account for the pairwise covariation observed in microbiome data. Here we introduce an interacting stochastic logistic model (ISLM) that minimally extends the SLM by sampling an ensemble of random interaction networks chosen to preserve these single-species laws. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we map the model's phase diagram -- stable, chaotic, and unbounded-growth regimes -- where the transition from stable fixed-point to chaos is controlled by network sparsity and interaction heterogeneity via a May-like instability line. Going beyond mean-field theory to account for finite communities, we derive an estimator of an effective stability parameter that quantifies distance to the edge of instability and can be inferred from the width of the distribution of pairwise covariances in empirical species-abundance data. Applying this framework to synthetic data, environmental microbiomes, and human gut cohorts indicates that these communities tend to operate near the edge of instability. Moreover, gut communities from healthy individuals cluster closer to this edge and exhibit broader, more heterogeneous associations, whereas dysbiosis-associated states shift toward more stable regimes -- enabling discrimination across conditions such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Together, our results connect macroecological laws, interaction-network ensembles, and May's stability theory, suggesting that complex communities may benefit from operating near a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modelling and evaluation of preclinical trials in acute leukaemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models are widely used to mathematically describe biological phenomena that evolve over time. One important area of application is leukaemia research, where leukaemia cells are genetically modified in preclinical studies to explore new therapeutic targets for reducing leukaemic burden. In advanced experiments, these studies are often conducted in mice and generate time-resolved data, the analysis of which may reveal growth-inhibiting effects of the investigated gene modifications. However, the experimental data is often times evaluated using statistical tests which compare measurements from only two different time points. This approach does not only reduce the time series to two instances but also neglects biological knowledge about cell mechanisms. Such knowledge, translated into mathematical models, expands the power to investigate and understand effects of modifications on underlying mechanisms based on experimental data. We utilise two population growth models -- an exponential and a logistic growth model -- to capture cell dynamics over the whole experimental time horizon and to consider all measurement times jointly. This approach enables us to derive modification effects from estimated model parameters. We demonstrate that the exponential growth model recognises simulated scenarios more reliably than the other candidate model and than a statistical test. Moreover, we apply the population growth models to evaluate the efficacy of candidate gene knockouts in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukaemia.</description>

      <title>Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</description>

      <title>InstructPLM-mu: 1-Hour Fine-Tuning of ESM2 Beats ESM3 in Protein Mutation Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.</description>

      <title>Explainable histomorphology-based survival prediction of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (GBM-IDHwt) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival.</description>
