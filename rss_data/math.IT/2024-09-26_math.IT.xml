      <title>Excitation Waveforms for Maximum Instantaneous Power Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a computational approach to identify performance constraints in the time-domain based on optimizing the excitation waveform. The method builds on an optimization algorithm that has been employed for decades to establish fundamental limits in the frequency domain and this paper showcases its first comprehensive application to time-domain pulses. The method is applied to arbitrarily polarized multiport antennas and arrays. The demonstration performed is based on finding an antenna's maximum peak radiation intensity in a given direction and time with limited total input energy available. To highlight the generality of the approach, an analysis on finding optimal illumination for antiferromagnetic memory switching is conducted.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Codes from Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of mathematics, a purely combinatorial equivalent to a simplicial complex, or more generally, a down-set, is an abstract structure known as a family of sets. This family is closed under the operation of taking subsets, meaning that every subset of a set within the family is also included in the family. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to present a comprehensive survey of recent results in the field. This survey intends to provide an overview of the advancements made in codes constructed from simplicial complexes. Secondly, the paper seeks to propose open problems that are anticipated to stimulate further research in this area. By highlighting these open problems, the paper aims to encourage and inspire future investigations and developments in the field of codes derived from simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model-Based Channel Estimation for THz Band Massive MIMO with RF Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz band enabled large scale massive MIMO (M-MIMO) is considered as a key enabler for the 6G technology, given its enormous bandwidth and for its low latency connectivity. In the large-scale M-MIMO configuration, enlarged array aperture and small wavelengths of THz results in an amalgamation of both far field and near field paths, which makes tasks such as channel estimation for THz M-MIMO highly challenging. Moreover, at the THz transceiver, radio frequency (RF) impairments such as phase noise (PN) of the analog devices also leads to degradation in channel estimation performance. Classical estimators as well as traditional deep learning (DL) based algorithms struggle to maintain their robustness when performing for large scale antenna arrays i.e., M-MIMO, and when RF impairments are considered for practical usage. To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to utilize a neural network (NN) that has the ability to study the behaviors of the channel and RF impairment correlations, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RF impairments act as sequential noise data which is subsequently incorporated with the channel data, leading to choose a specific type of RNN known as bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) which is followed by gated recurrent units (GRU) to process the sequential data. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other benchmark approaches at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nyquist USF Spectral Estimation: $K$ Frequencies with $6K + 4$ Modulo Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital acquisition of high bandwidth signals is particularly challenging when Nyquist rate sampling is impractical. This has led to extensive research in sub-Nyquist sampling methods, primarily for spectral and sinusoidal frequency estimation. However, these methods struggle with high-dynamic-range (HDR) signals that can saturate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Addressing this, we introduce a novel sub-Nyquist spectral estimation method, driven by the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF), utilizing a multi-channel system. The sub-Nyquist USF method aliases samples in both amplitude and frequency domains, rendering the inverse problem particularly challenging. Towards this goal, our exact recovery theorem establishes that $K$ sinusoids of arbitrary amplitudes and frequencies can be recovered from $6K + 4$ modulo samples, remarkably, independent of the sampling rate or folding threshold. In the true spirit of sub-Nyquist sampling, via modulo ADC hardware experiments, we demonstrate successful spectrum estimation of HDR signals in the kHz range using Hz range sampling rates (0.078\% Nyquist rate). Our experiments also reveal up to a 33-fold improvement in frequency estimation accuracy using one less bit compared to conventional ADCs. These findings open new avenues in spectral estimation applications, e.g., radars, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, and cognitive radio, showcasing the potential of USF.</description>

      <title>MambaJSCC: Adaptive Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Generalized State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight and efficient neural network models for deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) are crucial for semantic communications. In this paper, we propose a novel JSCC architecture, named MambaJSCC, that achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational and parameter overhead. MambaJSCC utilizes the visual state space model with channel adaptation (VSSM-CA) blocks as its backbone for transmitting images over wireless channels, where the VSSM-CA primarily consists of the generalized state space models (GSSM) and the zero-parameter, zero-computational channel adaptation method (CSI-ReST). We design the GSSM module, leveraging reversible matrix transformations to express generalized scan expanding operations, and theoretically prove that two GSSM modules can effectively capture global information. We discover that GSSM inherently possesses the ability to adapt to channels, a form of endogenous intelligence. Based on this, we design the CSI-ReST method, which injects channel state information (CSI) into the initial state of GSSM to utilize its native response, and into the residual state to mitigate CSI forgetting, enabling effective channel adaptation without introducing additional computational and parameter overhead. Experimental results show that MambaJSCC not only outperforms existing JSCC methods (e.g., SwinJSCC) across various scenarios but also significantly reduces parameter size, computational overhead, and inference delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Hermitian rank-metric codes, a special class of rank-metric codes, focusing on perfect codes and on the analysis of their covering properties. Firstly, we establish bounds on the size of spheres in the space of Hermitian matrices and, as a consequence, we show that non-trivial perfect codes do not exist in the Hermitian case. We conclude the paper by examining their covering density.</description>

      <title>Optimal Denial-of-Service Attacks Against Partially-Observable Real-Time Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of denial-of-service attacks on the status updating of a cyber-physical system with one or more sensors connected to a remote monitor via unreliable channels. We approach the problem from the perspective of an adversary that can strategically jam a subset of the channels. The sources are modeled as Markov chains, and the performance of status updating is measured based on the age of incorrect information at the monitor. Our objective is to derive jamming policies that strike a balance between the degradation of the system's performance and the conservation of the adversary's energy. For a single-source scenario, we formulate the problem as a partially-observable Markov decision process, and rigorously prove that the optimal jamming policy is of a threshold form. We then extend the problem to a multi-source scenario. We formulate this problem as a restless multi-armed bandit, and provide a jamming policy based on the Whittle's index. Our numerical results highlight the performance of our policies compared to baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Algorithm Selection for Interval-Based Coding Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a class of entropy-coding methods which do not substitute symbols by code words (such as Huffman coding), but operate on intervals or ranges. This class includes three prominent members: conventional arithmetic coding, range coding, and coding based on asymmetric numeral systems. To determine the correct symbol in the decoder, each of these methods requires the comparison of a state variable with subinterval boundaries. In adaptive operation, considering varying symbol statistics, an array of interval boundaries must additionally be kept up to date. The larger the symbol alphabet, the more time-consuming both the search for the correct subinterval and the updating of interval borders become.
  Detailed pseudo-code is used to discuss different approaches to speed up the symbol search in the decoder and the adaptation of the array of interval borders, both depending on the chosen alphabet size. It is shown that reducing the $\mathcal{O}$-complexity does not lead to an acceleration in practical implementations if the alphabet size is too small. In adaptive compression mode, the binary indexing method proves to be superior when considering the overall processing time. Although the symbol search (in the decoder) takes longer than with other algorithms, the faster updating of the array of interval borders more than compensates for this disadvantage. A variant of the binary indexing method is proposed, which is more flexible and has a partially lower complexity than the original approach.</description>

      <title>Random ensembles of symplectic and unitary states are indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unitary state $t$-design is an ensemble of pure quantum states whose moments match up to the $t$-th order those of states uniformly sampled from a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Typically, unitary state $t$-designs are obtained by evolving some reference pure state with unitaries from an ensemble that forms a design over the unitary group $\mathbb{U}(d)$, as unitary designs induce state designs. However, in this work we study whether Haar random symplectic states -- i.e., states obtained by evolving some reference state with unitaries sampled according to the Haar measure over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ -- form unitary state $t$-designs. Importantly, we recall that random symplectic unitaries fail to be unitary designs for $t&gt;1$, and that, while it is known that symplectic unitaries are universal, this does not imply that their Haar measure leads to a state design. Notably, our main result states that Haar random symplectic states form unitary $t$-designs for all $t$, meaning that their distribution is unconditionally indistinguishable from that of unitary Haar random states, even with tests that use infinite copies of each state. As such, our work showcases the intriguing possibility of creating state $t$-designs using ensembles of unitaries which do not constitute designs over $\mathbb{U}(d)$ themselves, such as ensembles that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$.</description>

      <title>Distributed Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna: Unveiling Directional Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces based on channel spatial distribution. However, the existing works on 6DMA have assumed a central processing unit (CPU) to jointly process the signals of all 6DMA surfaces to execute various tasks. This inevitably incurs prohibitively high processing cost for channel estimation. Therefore, we propose a distributed 6DMA processing architecture to reduce processing complexity of CPU by equipping each 6DMA surface with a local processing unit (LPU). In particular, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of 6DMA channels, where each user has significant channel gains only for a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from users. In addition, we propose a practical three-stage protocol for the 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) to conduct statistical CSI acquisition for all 6DMA candidate positions/rotations, 6DMA position/rotation optimization, and instantaneous channel estimation for user data transmission with optimized 6DMA positions/rotations. Specifically, the directional sparsity is leveraged to develop distributed algorithms for joint sparsity detection and channel power estimation, as well as for directional sparsity-aided instantaneous channel estimation. Using the estimated channel power, we develop a channel power-based optimization algorithm to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the users by optimizing the antenna positions/rotations. Simulation results show that our channel estimation algorithms are more accurate than benchmarks with lower pilot overhead, and our optimization outperforms fluid/movable antennas optimized only in two dimensions (2D), even when the latter have perfect instantaneous CSI.</description>

      <title>Is speckle noise more challenging to mitigate than additive noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a function in the presence of both speckle and additive noises. Although additive noise has been thoroughly explored in nonparametric estimation, speckle noise, prevalent in applications such as synthetic aperture radar, ultrasound imaging, and digital holography, has not received as much attention. Consequently, there is a lack of theoretical investigations into the fundamental limits of mitigating the speckle noise.
  This paper is the first step in filling this gap. Our focus is on investigating the minimax estimation error for estimating a $\beta$-H\"older continuous function and determining the rate of the minimax risk. Specifically, if $n$ represents the number of data points, $f$ denotes the underlying function to be estimated, and $\hat{\nu}_n$ is an estimate of $f$, then $\inf_{\hat{\nu}_n} \sup_f \mathbb{E}_f\| \hat{\nu}_n - f \|^2_2$ decays at the rate $n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$. Interestingly, this rate is identical to the one achieved for mitigating additive noise when the noise's variance is $\Theta(1)$.
  To validate the accuracy of our minimax upper bounds, we implement the minimax optimal algorithms on simulated data and employ Monte Carlo simulations to characterize their exact risk. Our simulations closely mirror the expected behaviors in decay rate as per our theory.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Benders Decomposition Approach for Optimal Large-Scale Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests to a common shared network infrastructure and allocate network resources to meet diverse service requirements. This paper proposes an efficient customized Benders decomposition algorithm for globally solving the large-scale NP-hard NS problem. The proposed algorithm decomposes the hard NS problem into two relatively easy function placement (FP) and traffic routing (TR) subproblems and iteratively solves them enabling the information feedback between each other, which makes it particularly suitable to solve large-scale problems. Specifically, the FP subproblem is to place service functions into cloud nodes in the network, and solving it can return a function placement strategy based on which the TR subproblem is defined; and the TR subproblem is to find paths connecting two nodes hosting two adjacent functions in the network, and solving it can either verify that the solution of the FP subproblem is an optimal solution of the original problem, or return a valid inequality to the FP subproblem that cuts off the current infeasible solution. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution of the NS problem. By taking the special structure of the NS problem into consideration, we successfully develop two families of valid inequalities that render the proposed algorithm converge much more quickly and thus much more efficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed valid inequalities effectively accelerate the convergence of the decomposition algorithm, and the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both solution efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>Byzantine Multiple Access Channels -- Part II: Communication With Adversary Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the problem of determining the identity of a byzantine user (internal adversary) in a communication system. We consider a two-user discrete memoryless multiple access channel where either user may deviate from the prescribed behaviour. Since small deviations may be indistinguishable from the effects of channel noise, it might be overly restrictive to attempt to detect all deviations. When neither user deviates, correct decoding is required. When one user deviates, the decoder must either output a pair of messages of which the message of the non-deviating user is correct or identify the deviating user. The users and the receiver do not share any randomness. The results include a characterization of the set of channels where communication is feasible, and an inner and outer bound on the capacity region. We also show that whenever the rate region has non-empty interior, the capacity region is same as the capacity region under randomized encoding, where each user shares independent randomness with the receiver. We also give an outer bound for this randomized coding capacity region.</description>

      <title>Additive Complementary Pairs of Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An additive code is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, which is not a linear subspace over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Linear complementary pairs (LCP) of codes have important roles in cryptography, such as increasing the speed and capacity of digital communication and strengthening security by improving the encryption necessities to resist cryptanalytic attacks. This paper studies an algebraic structure of additive complementary pairs (ACP) of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Further, we characterize an ACP of codes in analogous generator matrices and parity check matrices. Additionally, we identify a necessary condition for an ACP of codes. Besides, we present some constructions of an ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ from LCP codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and also from an LCP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Finally, we study the constacyclic ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and the counting of the constacyclic ACP of codes.</description>

      <title>Learnable Wireless Digital Twins: Reconstructing Electromagnetic Field with Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully harvesting the gain of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) requires accurate channel information. However, conventional channel acquisition methods mainly rely on pilot training signals, resulting in significant training overheads (time, energy, spectrum). Digital twin-aided communications have been proposed in [1] to reduce or eliminate this overhead by approximating the real world with a digital replica. However, how to implement a digital twin-aided communication system brings new challenges. In particular, how to model the 3D environment and the associated EM properties, as well as how to update the environment dynamics in a coherent manner. To address these challenges, motivated by the latest advancements in computer vision, 3D reconstruction and neural radiance field, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for future generation wireless systems that can reconstruct the 3D EM field covered by a wireless access point, based on widely available crowd-sourced world-locked wireless samples between the access point and the devices. This visionary framework is grounded in classical EM theory and employs deep learning models to learn the EM properties and interaction behaviors of the objects in the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learnable digital twin can implicitly learn the EM properties of the objects, accurately predict wireless channels, and generalize to changes in the environment, highlighting the prospect of this novel direction for future generation wireless platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Intermittent CSI Estimation with Adaptive Intervals in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the distinct objectives and multipath utilization mechanisms between the communication module and radar module, the system design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) necessitates two types of channel state information (CSI), i.e., communication CSI representing the whole channel gain and phase shifts, and radar CSI exclusively focused on target mobility and position information. However, current ISAC systems apply an identical mechanism to estimate both types of CSI at the same predetermined estimation interval, leading to significant overhead and compromised performances. Therefore, this paper proposes an intermittent communication and radar CSI estimation scheme with adaptive intervals for individual users/targets, where both types of CSI can be predicted using channel temporal correlations for cost reduction or re-estimated via training signal transmission for improved estimation accuracy. Specifically, we jointly optimize the binary CSI re-estimation/prediction decisions and transmit beamforming matrices for individual users/targets to maximize communication transmission rates and minimize radar tracking errors and costs in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) ISAC system. Unfortunately, this problem has causality issues because it requires comparing system performances under re-estimated CSI and predicted CSI during the optimization. Additionally, the binary decision makes the joint design a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, resulting in high complexity when using conventional optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement online learning (DROL) framework that first implements an online deep neural network (DNN) to learn the binary CSI updating decisions from the experiences. Given the learned decisions, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the remaining beamforming design problem efficiently.</description>

      <title>Synchronizable hybrid subsystem codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum synchronizable codes are quantum error correcting codes that can correct not only Pauli errors but also errors in block synchronization. The code can be constructed from two classical cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$ satisfying $\mathcal{C}^{\perp} \subset \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{D}$ through the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code construction. In this work, we establish connections between quantum synchronizable codes, subsystem codes, and hybrid codes constructed from the same pair of classical cyclic codes. We also propose a method to construct a synchronizable hybrid subsystem code which can correct both Pauli and synchronization errors, is resilient to gauge errors by virtue of the subsystem structure, and can transmit both classical and quantum information, all at the same time. The trade-offs between the number of synchronization errors that the code can correct, the number of gauge qubits, and the number of logical classical bits of the code are also established. In addition, we propose general methods to construct hybrid and hybrid subsystem codes of CSS type from classical codes, which cover relevant codes from our main construction.</description>

      <title>Separable Bregman Framework for Sparsity Constrained Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the minimization of a continuously differentiable function over a cardinality constraint. We focus on smooth and relatively smooth functions. These smoothness criteria result in new descent lemmas. Based on the new descent lemmas, novel optimality conditions and algorithms are developed, which extend the previously proposed hard-thresholding algorithms. We give a theoretical analysis of these algorithms and extend previous results on properties of iterative hard thresholding-like algorithms. In particular, we focus on the weighted $\ell_2$ norm, which requires efficient solution of convex subproblems. We apply our algorithms to compressed sensing problems to demonstrate the theoretical findings and the enhancements achieved through the proposed framework.</description>
