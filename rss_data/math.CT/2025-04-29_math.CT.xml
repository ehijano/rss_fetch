      <title>Directories: A Convenient and Well-Behaved Formalism for Hierarchical Organization in Categorical Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19389v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an inherently strict presentation of categories with products, coproducts, or symmetric monoidal products that is inspired by file systems and directories. Rather than using nested binary tuples to combine objects or morphisms, the presentation uses named tuples. Specifically, we develop 2-monads whose strict 2-algebras are product categories, coproduct categories, or symmetric monoidal categories, in a similar vein to the classical Fam construction, but where the elements of the indexing set are period-separated identifiers like $\mathtt{cart.motor.momentum}$. Our development of directories is also intended to serve the secondary purpose of expositing certain aspects of polynomial monads, and is accompanied by Haskell code that shows how the mathematical ideas can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Semi-abelian by Design: Johnstone Algebras Unifying Implication and Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Johnstone demonstrated that Heyting semilattices form a semi-abelian category via a specific triple of terms. Inspired by this work, we introduce \emph{Johnstone algebras} or J-algebras. The algebraic $(*,\to,e)$-theory $J$ of arities $(2,2,0)$ consists of three axioms carefully chosen to ensure protomodularity in alignment with Johnstone's terms. Johnstone algebras generalize well-known structures such as groups (division) and Heyting semilattices (implication) providing a unified framework within the well-behaved setting of semi-abelian categories.
  We present two primary contributions. First, we identify the M-axiom, \[ (t(x,y)\to x)\to (t(x,y)\to z) \approx x\to z, \text{ where }t(x,y) = (x\to y)\to y. \] The M-axiom is satisfied by residuated Johnstone algebras, and it can be considered a weakening of the H-axiom to comparable elements. We show that $t(x,y)$ defines a \emph{relative closure term} in MBC-algebras, and it implies that MBC-algebras form a variety of algebras, thereby generalizing the corresponding theorem related to HBCK-algebras. Second, we prove several no-go results, demonstrating that balanced theories or theories admitting non-discrete monotone or inflationary algebras cannot possess Malcev terms.
  Together, these results establish Johnstone algebras as significant structures that achieve desirable categorical properties by carefully integrating both logical and symmetric features, while closely avoiding the constraints imposed by our no-go results.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Premonoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06075v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Premonoidal categories are monoidal categories without the interchange law while effectful categories are premonoidal categories with a chosen monoidal subcategory of interchanging morphisms. In the same sense that string diagrams, pioneered by Joyal and Street, are an internal language for monoidal categories, we show that string diagrams with an added "runtime object", pioneered by Alan Jeffrey, are an internal language for effectful categories and can be used as string diagrams for effectful, premonoidal, and Freyd categories.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Double categories of profunctors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize virtual double categories of enriched categories, functors, and profunctors by introducing a new notion of double-categorical colimits. Our characterization is strict in the sense that it is up to equivalence between virtual double categories and, at the level of objects, up to isomorphism of enriched categories. Throughout the paper, we treat enrichment in a unital virtual double category rather than in a bicategory or a monoidal category, and, for consistency and better visualization of pasting diagrams, we adopt augmented virtual double categories as a fundamental language for double-categorical concepts.</description>

      <title>Additivity and Fiber Sequences for Combinatorial K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (A)CGW categories of Campbell and Zakharevich show how finite sets and varieties behave like the objects of an exact category for the purpose of algebraic $K$-theory. These structures admit a well-behaved Q-construction akin to Quillen's, and satisfy analogues of the D\'evissage and Localization theorems. In this work, we modify Campbell and Zakharevich's axioms to obtain a framework called ECGW categories that allows for an $S_\bullet$-construction akin to Waldhausen's, and show how it produces a K-theory spectrum which satisfies an analogue of the Additivity Theorem. We also define a notion of ``relative ECGW categories'' which have weak equivalences determined by a subcategory of acyclic objects satisfying minimal conditions; these satisfy analogues of the Fibration and Localization Theorems that generalize previous versions in the literature. We illustrate these results with examples including exact categories, extensive categories, algebraic varieties, and polytopes up to scissors congruence.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and Calabi-Yau structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper Calabi-Yau structures. This result is a generalization and conceptual explanation of the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For a topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of chains on the based loop space of X.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories, demonstrating that under certain general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Building on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Almost mathematics, Persistence module, and Tamarkin category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We precisely uniform 3 theories that are widely used for symplectic geometers: (Almost) modules over Novikov ring, Persistence module, and Tamarkin category. Along with our method, we also give a neat understanding and language for the related results, in particular, Vaintrob's Novikov/log-perfectoid mirror symmetry for Novikov toric varieties. The results of this paper can also be treated as a study of persistent homology from a higher algebra point of view. Some of our results are shown in the literature, but our method is higher-categorical and sophisticated.
  As applications, we discuss a Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties and propose a conjecture for Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>
