      <title>Towards Agentic AI on Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show two examples, where we demonstrate viability of such architecture.</description>

      <title>Realizing Steady-State Microbunching with Optical Stochastic Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) is a state-of-the-art beam cooling technology first demonstrated in 2021 at the IOTA storage ring at Fermilab's FAST facility. A second phase of the research program is planned to run in early 2025 and will incorporate an optical amplifier to enable significantly increased cooling rates and greater operational flexibility. In addition to beam cooling, an OSC system can be configured to enable advanced control over the phase space of the beam. An example operational mode could enable crystallization, where the particles in a bunch are locked into a self-reinforcing, regular microstructure at the OSC fundamental wavelength; we refer to this as Optical Stochastic Crystallization (OSX). OSX represents a new path toward Steady-State Microbunching (SSMB), which may enable light sources combining the high brightness of a free-electron laser with the high repetition rate of a storage ring. Such a source has applications from the terahertz to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), including high-power EUV generation for semiconductor lithography. This contribution will discuss the status of the OSC experimental program and its potential to achieve the first demonstration of SSMB during the upcoming experimental run.</description>
