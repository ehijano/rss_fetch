      <title>Estimation of nanometer-thickness layer of 6B graphite: an experimental activity to study Ohm's law in higher education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ohm's law is crucial for understanding electrical circuits and conductive materials. Formulated by Georg Simon Ohm in the 19th century, it describes the direct proportional relationship between electric voltage and electric current in ohmic conductors. Despite its apparent simplicity, the literature has pointed out that students at different educational levels have difficulty understanding it, especially due to the abstraction associated with the concepts of electric voltage, electric current, and electrical resistance. In order to provide possibilities to overcome this abstraction and the associated learning difficulties, the present work proposes an experimental activity that applies Ohm's law to determine the nanometer-scale thickness of 6B graphite traces deposited on tracing paper. The employed methodology is based on measuring physical quantities such as electric voltage, electric current, and length, and on analyzing the collected data. The thickness of the graphite traces determined by this method was also compared with values obtained using a scanning probe microscope (SPM). Based on the proposed methodology, the thickness of the traces was determined to be 456.5(34)~nm, while SPM measurements yielded an average thickness of 440(50)~nm. Thus, the results show good agreement between the measurements within experimental uncertainties, validating the effectiveness of the suggested methodology and indicating that it is a viable proposal for electricity courses in higher education and, with adaptations, even for high school.</description>

      <title>AI-Supported Mini-Labs: Combining Smartphone-Based Experiments and Multimodal AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept of AI-supported Mini-Labs, combining smartphone-based experiments with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Smartphones, with their integrated sensors and computational power, function as versatile mobile laboratories for physics education. While they enable the collection of rich experimental data, the analysis of complex everyday phenomena has often been limited in the classroom. Advances in MLLMs now allow learners to process multimodal data, text, images, audio, and video, and receive support in experiment design, data analysis, and scientific interpretation. Three case studies highlight the approach: determining a vehicle drag coefficient from accelerometer data, measuring the ionospheric reflection height from lightning-generated signals analyzed as audio spectrograms, and real-time spectroscopy of blood volume dynamics using smartphone video. The results show clear advantages over conventional methods, including time savings, high-quality visualizations, and individualized guidance. Beyond simplifying data analysis, AI-augmented pocket labs foster representational competence, critical thinking, and 21st-century skills. This hybrid approach offers a promising pathway for individualized and inquiry-based science education, though further studies are needed to assess long-term learning effects and potential risks.</description>

      <title>Coupled Oscillators, Frequency Transfer and the Higgs Mechanism's Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple model to teach the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics. The basic idea is associated with the analysis of two particles' motion subjected to specific potentials that, in certain situations, will reproduce oscillatory motions with a frequency transfer effect.</description>
