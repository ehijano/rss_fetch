      <title>Improving the Precision of First-Principles Calculation of Parton Physics from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for computing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first principles using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field theory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion and perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables -- quasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon resummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates higher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative and power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical uncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further simplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of transverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative region. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton observables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently proposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access to unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios, which will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power corrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state contamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions, are expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state isolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have entered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement, which will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <title>$S$-wave kaon-nucleon interactions from lattice QCD on the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate S-wave kaon-nucleon ($KN$) interactions with strangeness $S=+1$ in lattice QCD using the time-dependent HAL QCD method. Employing $(2+1)$-flavor gauge configuration with $m_{\pi}\approx 137~\textrm{MeV}$ and $m_{K}\approx 502~\textrm{MeV}$, we calculate the $KN$ potentials at the leading order in the derivative expansion. The potentials in both isospin channels ($I=1$ and $I=0$) exhibit repulsion at short distances, while only the $I=0$ potential has a small attractive pocket at intermediate distances. The phase shifts computed from these potentials show no signals corresponding to resonances or bound states in both isospin channels, suggesting the absence of the $\Theta^{+}(1540)$ pentaquark in the S-wave $KN$ systems. The scattering lengths result in $a^{I=1}_{0} = -0.226(5)(^{+5}_{-0})~\textrm{fm}$ and $a^{I=0}_{0} = +0.031(62)(^{+0}_{-29})~\textrm{fm}$. Our results of the S-wave cross sections for $I=1$ are consistent with some of the experimental data within $2-3$ $\sigma$, while they deviate from others. The results for $I=0$, combined with recent studies on chiral perturbation theory, suggest that the scattering amplitudes in this channel are dominated by P-wave components rather than S-wave.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group approach to entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) using the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. The reduced density matrix of a $d$-dimensional quantum system is represented as a $(d+1)$-dimensional tensor network. We develop an explicit algorithm for $d=1$ that enables the calculation of EE for single-interval subsystems of arbitrary size. We test our method in two-dimensional tensor network of the Ising model. The central charge is obtained as $c=0.49997(8)$ for $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical prediction within an error, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fermion Discretization Effects in the Two-Flavor Lattice Schwinger Model: A Study with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive tensor network study of staggered, Wilson, and twisted mass fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation, using the massive two-flavor Schwinger model as a benchmark. Particular emphasis is placed on twisted mass fermions, whose properties in this context have not been systematically explored before. We confirm the expected O(a) improvement in the free theory and observe that this improvement persists in the interacting case. By leveraging an electric-field-based method for mass renormalization, we reliably tune to maximal twist and establish the method's applicability in the two-flavor model. Once mass renormalization is included, the pion mass exhibits rapid convergence to the continuum limit. Finite-volume effects are addressed using two complementary approaches: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume scaling. Our results show excellent agreement with semiclassical predictions and reveal a milder volume dependence for twisted mass fermions compared to staggered and Wilson discretizations. In addition, we observe clear isospin-breaking effects, suggesting intriguing parallels with lattice QCD. These findings highlight the advantages of twisted mass fermions for Hamiltonian simulations and motivate their further exploration, particularly in view of future applications to higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow for parton distribution functions: first application to the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are central to precision QCD phenomenology. Their Mellin moments can be computed on the lattice, but direct determinations using local operators, besides $\langle x \rangle$, face severe challenges from reduced hypercubic symmetry, limiting results to the lowest moments. A recently proposed method resolves these issues using gradient flow. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by computing ratios of flavor non-singlet pion PDF moments up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$, on four lattice spacings at $m_\pi \simeq 411$ MeV. The moments and reconstructed PDF agree quantitatively with recent phenomenological extractions.</description>

      <title>Mass-deformed Super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb T^4$: sum over twisted sectors, $\mathbf{\theta}$-angle, and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory with a small gaugino mass $m$ and vacuum angle $\theta$ on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Introducing a detuning parameter $\Delta$, which measures the deviation from an exactly self-dual $\mathbb{T}^4$, and working in the limits $mLN \ll \Lambda LN \ll 1$ and $ \frac{(N-1) m^2 L^2}{4 \pi} \ll \Delta \ll 1$, where $L$ is the torus size and $\Lambda$ the strong-coupling scale, we compute the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates to leading order in $m^2L^2/\Delta$. The twists generate fractional-charge instantons, and we show that summing over all such contributions is crucial for reproducing the correct physical observables in the decompactified strong-coupling regime. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the sum over twisted sectors, already at small torus size, projects in the $m=0$ limit onto a definite superselection sector of the $\mathbb{R}^4$ theory. In the massless limit, we recover the exact value of the gaugino condensate $|\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle| = 16\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, and demonstrate how a spurious $U(1)$ symmetry eliminates all $CP$-violating effects. Our results are directly testable in lattice simulations, and our method extends naturally to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important class of observables in the heavy-ion collision programme concerns probes which are not sensitive to the prevailing strong interactions of QCD. The emission of photons, weak gauge bosons, and leptons fall into this category. Here I will describe the current status of such investigations, focusing on the emerging theoretical picture and its uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. I) An improved z-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the implementation of two novel ingredients in the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) approach [1-4]. The first new ingredient is the explicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input data for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually taken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL $z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach fully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes hadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative way. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable kernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the application of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever data and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be useful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak semileptonic decays of hadrons. An explicit numerical application will be presented in the companion paper [6], where the effects of sub-threshold branch-cuts are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. II) Sub-threshold branch-cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the general framework of multiple dispersive bounds, firstly discussed in the companion paper [1], to the study of sub-threshold branch-cuts. We propose the simultaneous application of a double dispersive bound as a proper way to take into account unitarity constraints within phenomenological analyses of hadronic form factors in the presence of sub-threshold branch-cuts. Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5], is modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the pair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the effects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model and the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production region are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or lattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is presented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound. The comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the $z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that the $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most precise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable results with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the pair-production region.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the QCD sum rule method to study the semileptonic weak decay of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*-}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$ into the single charmed baryon $\Omega_{c}^{*0}$ with spin $\frac{3}{2}$, corresponding to a $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}$ weak transition. A three-point correlation function is calculated in both the physical and theoretical sides to derive the sum rules for the form factors of the transition. The analysis incorporates both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions up to mass dimension six. After determining the working regions of the auxiliary parameters and performing numerical calculations of the sum rules of the form factors, we extract the $q^2$-dependent fit functions for the form factors. The obtained fit functions are then applied to compute the decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transition in all lepton channels. Our results, when compared with the future experimental data, can test the Standard Model predictions and probe potential deviations from the theoretical expectations in the $\Omega_{b}^{*-}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*0}\ \ell\ \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decay.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and eigenvalue dynamics of stochastic gradient descent in multilayer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.</description>

      <title>On $\Omega_{3c}NN$ and $\Omega_{3c} \Omega_{3c} N$ systems with HAL QCD potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs the Faddeev formalism in configuration space to investigate the $\Omega_{3c}NN$ cluster containing a triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{3c}$). Using the recently reported HAL QCD $S$-wave $\Omega_{3c}N$ potentials in the $^3S_1$ and $^5S_2$ channels, together with the MT-I--III nucleon--nucleon potential and neglecting the Coulomb force, we find no bound state for the $\Omega_{3c}np$ system. We predict near-threshold resonances in the $J^{\pi}=5/2^{+}$ (maximal total spin) and $J^{\pi}=1/2^{+}$ (minimal total spin) states, with resonance energies of $1.1~\mathrm{MeV}$ below and $0.0~\mathrm{MeV}$ at the three-body breakup threshold, respectively, at Euclidean time $t/a = 16$. A similar analysis of the $\Omega_{3c}\Omega_{3c}N$ system likewise reveals no bound states, though a possible resonance is indicated. The short-distance behavior of the HAL QCD $\Omega_{3c}N$ potential is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis of DECAL Sensor Noise for the Generation of Truly Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore here the stochastic behavior of the DECAL sensor's noise output, and we evaluate its potential application as a true random number generator (TRNG) using time series analysis. The main objectives are twofold: first, to characterize the intrinsic noise properties of the DECAL sensor in the absence of external stimuli, and second, to determine the feasibility of employing the sensor as a source of randomness. The collected sensor data are examined through statistical and time series methodologies, and subsequently modeled using an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. This modeling approach enables the transformation of the sensor's raw noise into a Gaussian white noise sequence, which serves as the basis for generating random bits. The resulting random numbers are subjected to a series of statistical tests for randomness, including the NIST test suite. Our findings indicate that the method produces statistically sound random numbers. However, the rate of bit generation is relatively low, limiting its practicality for real-time TRNG applications under the current configuration. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that time series modeling presents a promising framework for extracting randomness from the DECAL sensor, and that with further optimization, the sensor could serve as a reliable and effective TRNG.</description>

      <title>Moments from Momentum Derivatives in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. In this Letter for the first time we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to nucleon's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization approach, specifically within the Krankl and Manashov renormalization scheme. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Taking the nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) determined from the recent lattice simulations as input, we find that the state-of-the-art pQCD predictions significantly underestimate the available nucleon Dirac form factors in both space-like and time-like domains. This nuisance indicates that some additional soft nonfactorizable contribution might be called for to account for the measured nucleon electromagnetic form factor data up to $Q^2\approx 30\;{\rm GeV^2}$.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Calculation of Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass effects in off-light-cone distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop correction to the forward matrix element of an off-light-cone bi-local quark correlator characterised by a space-like separation $z^2$ in the presence of heavy quarks with mass $m$. This calculation allows us to extract the one-loop matching kernel, necessary to connect quasi and pseudo-distributions to collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), accounting for heavy-quark mass effects. Our result is exact in that it includes all powers of $z^2m^2$ at one loop in $\alpha_s$. In the limit $z^2m^2\rightarrow 0$, it consistently reduces to the known massless result. We also carry out an implementation of our expression, which allows us to compute the charm pseudo-distribution of the proton given its PDF. We finally comment on the quantitative impact of heavy-quark mass corrections.</description>

      <title>Creation of Wave Packets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>2d Cardy-Rabinovici model with the modified Villain lattice: Exact dualities and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories to study various oblique confinement states associated with the nonzero $\theta$ angles. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism, and we establish the exact $\theta$ periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of this model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.</description>
