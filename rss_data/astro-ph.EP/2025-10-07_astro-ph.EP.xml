      <title>The impact of internal versus external perturbations on close-in exoplanet architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a "preferred" end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mixture Modeling with Laboratory Near-Infrared Data I: Insights into Compositional Analysis of Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths ($\sim$1.2-2.5 $\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025). The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (&gt;80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).</description>

      <title>Edge-On Disk Study (EODS) II: HCO$^+$ and CO vertical stratification in the disk surrounding SSTTau042021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the \textsc{DiskFit} model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of $\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\sim 3 \times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\sim$ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius ($\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\sim$ 35 K above.</description>

      <title>Heat Reveals What Clouds Conceal: Global Carbon &amp; Longitudinally Asymmetric Chemistry on LTT 9779 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LTT-9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune (Rp ~ 4.7 Re, Mp ~ 29 Me) orbiting its Sun-like host star in just 19 hours, placing it deep within the "hot Neptune desert," where Neptunian planets are seldom found. We present new JWST NIRSpec G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2, indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert.</description>

      <title>A Link Between Rocky Planet Density and Host Star Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive \textsl{Ab Initio}~Calculations of \ce{CO2-H2} and \ce{CO2-He} Collisional Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present comprehensive \textsl{ab initio} calculations of CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He collisional properties from first principles, employing CCSD(T), potential calculations together with close-coupling dynamical scattering in the \YUMI~framework. We derive (in)elastic cross sections, rate coefficients, and pressure-broadening parameters -- incl., their rotational dependence up to $|m|=50$, and temperature dependence over the range of 100-800 K. We provide Pad\'e fits for the broadening coefficients as a function of rotational quantum number, enabling extrapolation of the results and integration into spectroscopic databases, including HITRAN and HITEMP. The computed potentials for both CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He have a sub-percent precision, and the dynamics-solving code YUMI ultimately yields the collisional parameters. Among these, the scaled pressure broadening experimental values meet the 10\% precision requirement for exoplanetary sciences with \textit{JWST}. This contrasts with the parameters available before the present calculations, which at higher temperatures (T$&gt;$400 K) deviate as much as 5$\times$ from the desired precision requirement. All derivations and collisional properties are provided with this manuscript, establishing the first of such a comprehensive ab initio foundation for collisional systems with a target molecule having more than two atoms.</description>

      <title>Observation of undepleted phosphine in the atmosphere of a low-temperature brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheres of low-temperature brown dwarfs and gas giant planets are expected to contain the phosphine molecule, PH$_3$ However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted by atmospheric chemistry models. We report JWST spectroscopic observations of phosphine in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf Wolf 1130C. Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine are detected around 4.3 ${\mu}$m, from which we calculate a phosphine abundance of 0.100$\pm$0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduce the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn, and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Kiladze Caldera: A Possible Cryovolcano on Pluto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast with regional primarily methane composition, Kiladze and its surroundings exhibit a water-ice spectral signature that carries an ammoniated compound, similar to two other cryovolcanic sites on Pluto. The faulted structure of Kiladze, including shaping by numerous collapse pits and the distortion of the shape of the depression, are compatible with the surroundings in Hayabusa Terra, east of Sputnik Planitia. They are further compatible with an interpretation as a caldera formed during an era of an active cryovolcanic period that appears to be significantly more recent than the overall age of the planet's surface, possibly in the last several million years. In view of the size of the caldera and the large scale of the surrounding distribution of water ice, we suggest that Kiladze may have been a cryovolcano, in which one or more explosive events may have erupted $\sim$1000 km$_{3}$ of icy cryomagma onto the surface.</description>

      <title>Competing chemical signatures in the atmosphere of TOI-270 d: Inference of sulfur and carbon chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST measurements allow access to the near-infrared spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, for which two different interpretations, a high-metallicity miscible envelope and a lower metallicity hycean world, are currently in conflict. Here, we reanalyze the published data and reproduce previously retrieved molecular abundances based on an independent data reduction and a different retrieval framework. The aim of this study is to refine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST data analysis. Additionally, we test the impact of data resolution on atmospheric retrieval calculations. We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H and one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a custom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native resolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR retrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions. Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at the red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular weight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and find statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich chemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of CH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these scenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Our analysis reinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere. However, its exact nature remains uncertain and warrants further detailed photochemical modeling and observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interior Structure and Mode of Tidal Heating in Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14743v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.</description>

      <title>The Roman Space Telescope as a Planetary Defense Asset</title>

Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch in October 2026, will serve a critical role in the characterization and threat assessment of near-Earth Objects (NEOs), thus contributing to national and international planetary defense objectives. Operating from the Earth-Sun L2 point and observing in the near-infrared, Roman has the high sensitivity and high spatial resolution needed to measure the physical properties, compositions, and orbital trajectories of NEOs in order to understand their physical nature and potential hazards to Earth. Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Local Hubble Parameter from the Thermal Evolution of Earth and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a long time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular interest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the Solar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.</description>
