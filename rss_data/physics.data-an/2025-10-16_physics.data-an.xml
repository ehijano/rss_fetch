      <title>Efficiency correction of particle-averaged quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytic formulas to reconstruct particle-averaged quantities from experimental results that suffer from the efficiency loss of particle measurements. These formulas are derived under the assumption that the probabilities of observing individual particles are independent. The formulas do not agree with the conventionally used intuitive formulas.</description>

      <title>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</description>

      <title>MCbiF: Measuring Topological Autocorrelation in Multiscale Clusterings via 2-Parameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datasets often possess an intrinsic multiscale structure with meaningful descriptions at different levels of coarseness. Such datasets are naturally described as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical sequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences, we use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales. The MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and reduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely presented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions characterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In particular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement order of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order inconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through experiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for downstream machine learning tasks. MCbiF feature maps outperform information-based baseline features on both regression and classification tasks on synthetic sets of non-hierarchical sequences of partitions. We also show an application of MCbiF to real-world data to measure non-hierarchies in wild mice social grouping patterns across time.</description>

      <title>Relationship between unpredictability and intermittency in shell models of turbulence and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the predictability of turbulent velocity signals using probabilistic analog-forecasting. Here, predictability is defined by the accuracy of forecasts and the associated uncertainties. We study the Gledzer--Ohkitani--Yamada (GOY) shell model of turbulence as well as experimental measurements from a fully developed turbulent flow. In both cases, we identify the extreme values of velocity at small scales as localized unpredictable events that lead to a loss of predictability: worse mean predictions and increase of their uncertainties. The GOY model, with its explicit scale separation, allows to evaluate the prediction performance at individual scales, and so to better relate the intensity of extreme events and the loss of forecast performance. Results show that predictability decreases systematically from large to small scales. These findings establish a statistical connection between predictability loss across scales and intermittency in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</description>
