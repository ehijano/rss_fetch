      <title>Spintronic Bayesian Hardware Driven by Stochastic Magnetic Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring reliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS implementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement in the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency, energy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's potential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing non-Hermitian tunneling phenomena using non-reciprocal active acoustic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems have been shown to exhibit various interesting wave phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect, which causes accumulation of modes at boundaries. Recent research on discrete systems showed that this effect can pose a barrier for waves hitting an interface between reciprocal and non-reciprocal systems. Under certain conditions, however, waves can tunnel through this barrier, similar to the tunneling of particles in quantum mechanics. This work proposes and investigates an active acoustic metamaterial design to realize this tunneling phenomenon in the acoustical wave domain. The metamaterial consists of an acoustic waveguide with microphones and loudspeakers embedded in its wall. Starting from a purely discrete non-Hermitian lattice model of the system, a hybrid continuous-discrete acoustic model is derived, resulting in distributed feedback control laws to realize the desired behavior for acoustic waves. The proposed control laws are validated using frequency and time domain finite element method simulations, which include lumped electro-acoustic loudspeaker models. Additionally, an experimental demonstration is performed using a waveguide with embedded active unit cells and a digital implementation of the control laws. In both the simulations and experiments the tunneling phenomenon is successfully observed.</description>

      <title>Photonic chip-based optical frequency division with PZT-integrated soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) produces low-noise microwave and millimeter-wave signals by transferring the exceptional stability of optical references to electronic frequency domains. Recent developments in integrated optical references and soliton microcombs have paved the way for miniaturizing OFD oscillators to chip scale. Critical to this realization is a rapid tunable frequency comb that is stabilized to the optical references, thereby coherently linking optical and electronic frequencies. In this work, we advance the on-chip OFD technology using an integrated high-speed PZT stress-optic actuator on the SiN soliton microcomb resonator. The integrated PZT actuator tunes the resonance frequency of the soliton-generating microresonator with a bandwidth exceeding 10s MHz and independently adjusts the soliton repetition rate without perturbing the frequency comb offset. Optical frequency division and low-noise mmWave generation are demonstrated by feedback control of the soliton repetition rate through the integrated PZT-actuator, and the soliton microcomb is stabilized to a pair of reference lasers that are locked to an integrated 4-meter SiN coil reference cavity. Our approach provides a fast, versatile and integrated control mechanism for OFD oscillators and their applications in advanced communications, sensing, and precise timing.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed, as first envisioned by Einstein, offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Recent breakthroughs show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering (TBS) pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The design of an integrated optical chip is proposed containing a rotation sensing ring resonator (optical gyroscope) coupled to an inverse weak value amplified Sagnac interferometer that amplifies the signal containing the phase information. We show that, for conservative parameter choices, our setup has a minimum detectable angular rotation rate of 0.1 deg/hr and an Allan deviation of 0.08 deg/hr under expected ideal conditions. We also show that for an appropriate amount of input power, our design can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the precision of angular rotation rate, and error in detection by more than ten times compared to a Sagnac interferometer coupled to a ring resonator.</description>

      <title>Low loss monolithic barium titanate on insulator integrated photonics with intrinsic quality factor &gt;1 million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) has been experiencing a surge of interest for integrated photonics technologies because of its large nonlinear optical coefficients, especially the Pockels coefficient, and in part due to newly available thin-film substrates. In this work, we report on the development of a redeposition-free dry etching technique for monolithic BTO-on-insulator photonics, that produces very low-roughness and high-verticality waveguides. Using this, we experimentally demonstrate the first BTO microresonators with intrinsic Q-factor $&gt; 1$ million, and waveguide propagation loss as small as 0.32 dB/cm, representing the lowest losses reported in any BTO-based integrated platform to date. We additionally demonstrate Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators with $V_{\pi}L = 0.54$ V$\cdot$cm and effective electro-optic coefficient $r_\text{eff} = 162$ pm/V.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann machine as a probabilistic Enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a symmetric encryption scheme based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines that functions as a probabilistic Enigma device, encoding information in the marginal distributions of visible states while utilizing bias permutations as cryptographic keys. Theoretical analysis reveals significant advantages including factorial key space growth through permutation matrices, excellent diffusion properties, and computational complexity rooted in sharp P-complete problems that resist quantum attacks. Compatible with emerging probabilistic computing hardware, the scheme establishes an asymmetric computational barrier where legitimate users decrypt efficiently while adversaries face exponential costs. This framework unlocks probabilistic computers' potential for cryptographic systems, offering an emerging encryption paradigm between classical and quantum regimes for post-quantum security.</description>

Abstract: Systematic studies on different SiN films in terms of propagation losses are presented, and deuterated SiN emerges as a good candidate for ultralow loss (&lt; 0.1 dB/cm) and reliability by simple 8-inch process with low thermal budget. Frequency comb generation in high-Q (~1 million) deuterated silicon nitride microring is demonstrated and used for intensity modulated direct detection transmission. Negligible power penalty for 25.78 GBaud/s NRZ and PAM4 is achieved at error rates &lt;10-6, below the FEC limit.</description>

      <title>Giant Spin-to-Charge Conversion by Tailoring Magnetically Proximitized Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While ferromagnet and topological material bilayers are widely studied to obtain efficient spin charge conversion via topological surface states (TSS), the influence of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on the TSS evolution and conversion efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally probe and reveal the behavior of spin momentum locked TSS through spin pumping measurements in heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic Fe and the topological Dirac semimetal alpha Sn. As the alpha Sn thickness (tSn) increases from 9 to 35 nm, the Gilbert damping constant of the Fe layer exhibits a pronounced peak at tSn = 25 nm, followed by a decrease at greater thicknesses. Our rigorous theoretical analysis, combining analytical modeling and first principles calculations, attributes this behavior to the TSS disappearance at the Fe and alpha Sn interface and exchange gap opening on the opposite surface, both induced by the long range MPE and its influence on the spin charge conversion efficiency. At tSn = 25 nm, we demonstrate highly efficient spin charge conversion with an inverse Edelstein length of 3.14 nm, the highest value reported at room temperature for ferromagnet and topological material bilayers. These findings underscore the critical role of tuning TSS properties under MPE for advancing topological materials in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>High-Q Millimeter-Wave Acoustic Resonators in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Using Higher-Order Antisymmetric Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents miniature millimeter wave (mmWave, above 30 GHz) acoustic resonators based on a single-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. More specifically, we present high performance third-order antisymmetric (A3) mode laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBAR). Compared to prior demonstrations, the proposed platform features a compact footprint due to a smaller lateral wavelength and aperture. We showcase an A3 mode device operating at 39.8 GHz with a high extracted electromechanical coupling (k^2) of 4%, a high 3-dB series resonance quality factor (Q_s) of 97, and a high 3-dB anti-resonance quality factor (Q_p) of 342, leading to a figure of merit (FoM=k^2*Q_p) of 13.7 with a footprint of 32x44 micron^2. To demonstrate frequency scalability, the piezoelectric film thickness is varied while keeping the device layout. As a result, we present a multitude of high-performance devices covering a wide frequency range of 30-50 GHz, validating the proposed XBAR design at mmWave.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>
