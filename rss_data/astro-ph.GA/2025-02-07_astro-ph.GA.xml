      <title>Emission-Line Diagnostics at z&gt;4: [OIII]{\lambda}4363/H\gamma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) observations from the the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey (CEERS), GLASS-JWST ERS (GLASS), and JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 90 galaxies at z&gt;4. The stacked spectra of galaxies with and without a broad-line feature reveal a difference in the [OIII]$\lambda$ 4363 and H$\gamma$ ratios. This motivated our investigation of the [OIII]/H$\gamma$ vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram. We define two AGN/SF classification lines based on 1869 SDSS galaxies at z$\sim$0. After applying a redshift correction to the AGN/SF lines we find 76.8% of BLAGN continue to land in the AGN region of the diagnostic largely due to the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio. However, 40.2% of non-BLAGN land in the AGN region as well, this could be due to star forming galaxies having harder ionization of there are narrow line AGN which are not accounted for. This indicates the potential of the [NeIII]/[OII] ratio to continue classifying galaxies to z$\sim$6. We further inspect galaxies without broad emission lines in each region of [OIII]/H\gamma vs [NeIII]/[OII] diagram and found that they have slightly stronger CIII]$\lambda$1908 fluxes and equivalent width when landing in the BLAGN region. However, the cause of this higher ionization is unclear. Additionally, we find that BLAGN are characterized by a higher ionization (at constant electron temperature) compared to non-broad line galaxies.</description>

      <title>Towards characterizing dark matter subhalo perturbations in stellar streams with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [$10^8$, $10^7$, $10^6$] $M_\odot$ perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with $10 \times$ fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.</description>

      <title>Realistic predictions for Gaia black hole discoveries: comparison of isolated binary and dynamical formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.</description>

      <title>Stellar population synthesis models with a physically varying IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting galactic luminosity requires assumptions about the galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF), often assumed invariant in most stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. If stars form in clusters with metallicity- and density-dependent \textit{stellar IMFs}, the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) can be calculated, with its shape depending on the star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity. The shape of the IGIMF thus depends on the star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity. We develop the \texttt{SPS-VarIMF} code which enables us for the first time to compute the spectra, luminosities, and remnant populations of galaxies in the context of the varying gwIMF with time, SFR, and an assumed metallicity. Using the \texttt{SPS-VarIMF} code one can calculate how the interpretation from the integrated galactic light may change if the underlying galaxy-wide IMF is assumed to be environmentally dependent instead of being invariant. In particular, we compare the time evolution of the galaxy color and the stellar mass-to-light ratio in different bands for the IGIMF and invariant canonical gwIMF assuming constant and delayed-$\tau$ star formation histories. We show that the underlying gwIMF can be determined by examining the colors and luminosities of late-type galaxies in UV and optical bands. On the other hand, for early-type galaxies, it is difficult to distinguish which gwIMF is valid since adopting the different gwIMFs yields almost identical colors. However, their gwIMF-dependent $M/L$ ratios differ by up to an order of magnitude. Massive present-day elliptical galaxies would have been $10^4$ times as bright as at present when they were forming.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: The emergence of the Hubble Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the wide area coverage of the COSMOS-Web survey, we quantify the abundance of different morphological types from $z\sim 7$ with unprecedented statistics and establish robust constraints on the epoch of emergence of the Hubble sequence. We measure the global (spheroids, disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, peculiar) and resolved (stellar bars) morphologies for about 400,000 galaxies down to F150W=27 using deep learning, representing a two-orders-of-magnitude increase over previous studies. We then provide reference Stellar Mass Functions (SMFs) of different morphologies between $z\sim 0.2$ and $z\sim 7$ and best-fit parameters to inform models of galaxy formation. All catalogs and data are made publicly available. (a)At redshift z &gt; 4.5, the massive galaxy population ($\log M_*/M_\odot&gt;10$) is dominated by disturbed morphologies (~70%) -- even in the optical rest frame -- and very compact objects (~30%) with effective radii smaller than ~500pc. This confirms that a significant fraction of the star formation at cosmic dawn occurs in very dense regions, although the stellar mass for these systems could be overestimated.(b)Galaxies with Hubble-type morphologies -- including bulge and disk-dominated galaxies -- arose rapidly around $z\sim 4$ and dominate the morphological diversity of massive galaxies as early as $z\sim 3$. (c)Using stellar bars as a proxy, we speculate that stellar disks in massive galaxies might have been common (&gt;50%) among the star-forming population since cosmic noon ($z\sim2$-2.5) and formed as early as $z\sim 7$ (d)Massive quenched galaxies are predominantly bulge-dominated from z~4 onward, suggesting that morphological transformations briefly precede or are simultaneous to quenching mechanisms at the high-mass end. (e) Low-mass ($\log M_*/M_\odot&lt;10$) quenched galaxies are typically disk-dominated, pointing to different quenching routes in the two ends of the stellar mass spectrum from cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>The relationship between galaxy size and halo properties: Insights from the IllustrisTNG simulations and differential clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of the radial sizes of galaxies and how galaxy sizes are correlated with the properties of their host dark matter halos is an open question in galaxy formation. In observations, the large-scale clustering of galaxies selected by stellar mass is significantly different for large and small galaxies, and Behroozi et al. (2022) showed that these results are in tension with some of the correlations between galaxy size and halo properties in the literature. We analyze the IllustrisTNG suite of large volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulations along with dark matter only simulations with matched initial conditions. We investigate correlations between the ratio of galaxy size to halo virial radius ($r_{\rm gal}/R_{\rm vir}$) and halo spin, concentration, and formation time at redshift 0-3. We find a significant correlation between $r_{\rm gal}/R_{\rm vir}$ and concentration, but only above a critical value $c \simeq 16$, and we also find a correlation between $r_{\rm gal}/R_{\rm vir}$ and halo formation time. We suggest that galaxy formation history and environment, in addition to halo properties at a given output time, play an important role in shaping galaxy size. In addition, we directly measure size-based differential clustering in the TNG300 simulation and compare directly with the observational results. We find significant scale-dependent size-based differential clustering in TNG, in qualitative agreement with observations. However, correlations between $r_{\rm gal}/R_{\rm vir}$ and secondary halo properties are not the drivers of the differential clustering in the simulations; instead, we find that most of this signal in TNG arises from satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ruling out AGNs as the dominant source of cosmic reionization with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Universe. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of objects (including galaxies and AGNs) in a specific redshift range between 7.15 and 7.75 that has a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. Assuming all point-source components are AGNs, we obtain an absolute upper limit for the density of the AGN population. This fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of $M_{\rm UV} \approx -15$ mag. Based on this sample, we find that AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons required to ionize the Universe in this redshift range. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.</description>

      <title>Iron-corrected Single-epoch Black Hole Masses of DESI Quasars at low redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the possible overestimation of single-epoch supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in previous works, based on more than 55,000 type 1 quasars at $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$ from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm that iron emission strength serves as a good tracer of the Eddington ratio, and estimate SMBH masses using an iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relation for H$\beta$, where $R$ is the broad line region size and $L$ is the continuum luminosity. Compared to our measurements, previous canonical measurements without the iron correction are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 on average. The overestimation can be up to a factor of 5 for super-Eddington quasars. The fraction of super-Eddington quasars in our sample is about 5%, significantly higher than 0.4% derived from the canonical measurements. Using a sample featuring both H$\beta$ and MgII emission lines, we calibrate MgII-based SMBH masses using iron-corrected, H$\beta$-based SMBH masses and establish an iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relation for MgII. The new relation adds an extra term of $-0.34R_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ to the $R$-$L$ relation, where $R_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ denotes the relative iron strength. We use this formula to build a catalog of about 0.5 million DESI quasars at $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.6$. If these iron-corrected $R$-$L$ relations for H$\beta$ and MgII are valid at high redshift, current mass measurements of luminous quasars at $z\ge6$ would have been overestimated by a factor of 2.3 on average, alleviating the tension between SMBH mass and growth history in the early universe.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between the cosmic web and the alignment of galaxies and AGN jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the evolution of galaxies explains the steep decrease in the number density of the most massive galaxies in the Universe. However, the fueling of the AGN and the efficiency of this feedback largely depend on their environment. We use data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 to make the first study of the orientations of radio jets and their optical counterpart in relation to the cosmic web environment. We find that close to filaments ($\lesssim 11 \,\rm Mpc$), galaxies tend to have their optical major axes aligned with the nearest filaments. On the other hand, radio jets, which are generally aligned perpendicularly to the optical major axis of the host galaxy, show more randomised orientations with respect to host galaxies within $\lesssim 8 \,\rm Mpc$ of filaments. These results support the scenario that massive galaxies in cosmic filaments grow by numerous mergers directed along the orientation of the filaments while experiencing chaotic accretion of gas onto the central black hole. The AGN-driven jets consequently have a strong impact preferentially along the minor axes of dark matter halos within filaments. We discuss the implications of these results for large-scale radio jet alignments, intrinsic alignments between galaxies, and the azimuthal anisotropy of the distribution of circumgalactic medium and anisotropic quenching.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing \textit{JWST} discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity ($\rm L_{X}$) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, $\rm L_X$ and SFR. The detection of a $\sim$ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at $z \geq$ 5 or a $\sim$ 2000 nJy flux at $z =$ 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are $\rm &lt; 30~ M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}$. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Identifying Compton-thick AGNs in the COSMOS. I. Among X-ray AGNs with Low Photon Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), characterized by a significant absorption with column densities of $\mathrm{N_H}\geqslant 1.5\times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, emit feeble X-ray radiation and are even undetectable by X-ray instruments, making them difficult to identify. X-ray radiation from AGNs is the predominant source of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Based on AGN synthesis models for the CXB, the fraction of CT-AGNs should constitute a substantial portion of AGN population, approximately 30\% or more. The fraction of CT-AGNs discovered in the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is significantly lower than this value. This means that many CT-AGNs may be hidden in AGNs that exhibit low photon counts or that have not been detected by X-ray instruments. This work focuses on identifying CT-AGNs hidden in AGNs with low photon counts. Firstly, we selected 440 AGNs with abundant multiwavelength data as our sample. Secondly, we analyzed multiwavelength data, extracting crucial physical parameters required for the CT-AGN diagnosis. Finally, we used multiwavelength approaches to identify CT-AGNs. We have successfully identified 18 CT-AGNs in our sample. Among the CT-AGNs, four AGNs show discrepant results across different diagnostic methods. We discuss the potential reasons behind these diagnostic discrepancies. We explore the impact of estimating [O~III]$\lambda~5007$ luminosities based on [O~II]$\lambda~3727$ luminosities for the CT-AGN diagnosis. We have also found that the properties of host galaxies for CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs do not show significant discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Candidate RR Lyrae Associated with the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Aquarius III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the search of RR Lyrae in the vicinity of a newly discovered ultrafaint dwarf galaxy, Aquarius III. Based on the known RR Lyrae catalogs and $gri$-band light curves retrieved from public archives, we identified a RR Lyrae with distance, metallicity, and proper motion consistent with Aquarius III. Therefore, this RR Lyrae is the first variable star identified to be associated with Aquarius III, despite its projected distance is more than 15 times the half-light radius of Aquarius III. On the other hand, a dedicated time-series monitoring of the central part of Aquarius III, out to a projected radius of approximately four half-light radius, revealed there is no RR Lyrae in this region. We ran a set of synthetic color-magnitude diagrams with properties similar to Aquarius III, and found a non-negligible probability that Aquarius III could have (at least one) RR Lyrae. We have also identified a RR Lyrae candidate but most likely it is a background halo star.</description>

      <title>Estimating the evolution and the content fractions of baryonic gas for Luminous Infrared Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) play a crucial role in understanding of galaxy evolution. The present study examined 82 LIRGs, using data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), and HyperLEDA to explore their gas fractions and optical properties. The analysis of data highlights the relationship between molecular-to-atomic mass of hydrogen gas ratio MH2/MH1 and morphological types, gas mass fractions, and galaxy characteristics such as color and luminosity. The results showed that the regressions between Mdust - M*,V and Mdust - SFR are not quite flat (when correlation coefficient &gt; 0.5), which indicates a decrease in the dust-to-stellar content ratio as the gas is consumed and transformed into stars, and also a relatively flat trend for M dust - M*,V and fdust,bar - M*,V. Moreover, as the star mass declines, the total gas mass fraction (fgas) increases quickly, with a high negative correlation coefficient of - 0.7 and a regression of - 0.85. Therefore, it can be inferred that galaxies with a high gas fraction (fgas) are either accreting gas at a rate sufficient to meet their energy requirements for star formation or converting gas into stars less effectively. According to the findings, the gas exhaustion time in these galaxies quickly reduces as the stellar mass increases, with a significant negative correlation coefficient of - 0.7 and a regression that is a nearly linear regression of - 0.9. On the other hand, when the baryonic gas mass fraction grows, which makes up the majority of the baryonic gas, grows, the gas depletion time increases quickly.</description>

      <title>ALMA observations of massive clouds in the central molecular zone: slim filaments tracing parsec-scale shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits widespread emission from SiO and various complex organic molecules (COMs), yet the exact origin of such emission is uncertain. Here we report the discovery of a unique class of long ($&gt;$0.5 pc) and narrow ($&lt;$0.03 pc) filaments in the emission of SiO 5$-$4 and eight additional molecular lines, including several COMs, in our ALMA 1.3 mm spectral line observations toward two massive molecular clouds in the CMZ, which we name as slim filaments. However, these filaments are not detected in the 1.3 mm continuum at the 5$\sigma$ level. Their line-of-sight velocities are coherent and inconsistent with being outflows. The column densities and relative abundances of the detected molecules are statistically similar to those in protostellar outflows but different from those in dense cores within the same clouds. Turbulent pressure in these filaments dominates over self gravity and leads to hydrostatic inequilibrium, indicating that they are a different class of objects than the dense gas filaments in dynamical equilibrium ubiquitously found in nearby molecular clouds. We argue that these newly detected slim filaments are associated with parsec-scale shocks, likely arising from dynamic interactions between shock waves and molecular clouds. The dissipation of the slim filaments may replenish SiO and COMs in the interstellar medium and lead to their widespread emission in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Gaps in stellar streams as a result of globular cluster fly-bys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin stellar streams, such as those resulting from the tidal disruption of globular clusters, have long been known and used as probes of the gravitational potential of our Galaxy, both its visible and dark contents. In particular, the presence of under-density regions, or gaps, along these streams is commonly interpreted as being due to the close passage of dark matter sub-halos. In this work, we investigate the perturbations induced on streams by the passage of dense stellar systems, such as globular clusters themselves, to test the possibility that they may cause the formation of gaps as well. In particular, we focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster in the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this purpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when subjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular clusters. Our study shows that the tails of Palomar 5 can be strongly perturbed by the close passage of other clusters, in particular of NGC 2808, NGC 7078, NGC 104, and that these perturbations induce the formation of gaps in the tails. These results show that globular clusters are capable of inducing gaps in streams--as other baryonic components such as giant molecular clouds and the galactic bar have been shown to do in other works. Therefore, when searching to construct the distribution function of dark matter sub halos within the Milky Way, the gap contribution from globular clusters must be included.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry at Low Surface Brightness as an Indicator of Environmental Processes in the Fornax Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies play an important role in studying the effects of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution. In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between the morphology, in particular the asymmetries of galaxies, and their distances to the cluster centre. For galaxies in the Fornax Deep Survey, we quantified the morphologies of dwarf galaxies using Asymmetry (A) and Smoothness (S). Unlike previous work, we use isophotal CAS-parameters, which are sensitive to the outer parts of galaxies. We constructed the A-r and S-r diagrams to investigate the relationship between morphology and distance. Additionally, we examined the effects of asymmetry on magnitude and colour. Furthermore, to better understand the assembly history of the galaxy cluster, we performed a phase-space analysis for Fornax dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxies in the outer regions of the Fornax cluster have higher values of asymmetry compared to other dwarfs in the cluster, indicating a greater degree of morphological disturbances within dwarf galaxies in these regions. We also find that galaxies in the very inner regions are more asymmetric than those further out. The A-magnitude relation reveals a trend where asymmetry increases as galaxies become fainter, and the A-colour relation shows that galaxies with bluer colours tend to exhibit higher asymmetry. We do not find any correlations with smoothness, except that smoothness strongly decreases with stellar mass. We propose that the higher asymmetry of dwarfs in the outer regions is most likely caused by ram pressure stripping. In the very inner parts, the asymmetries most likely are caused by tidal effects. In addition, our phase-space diagram suggests that galaxies near pericentre in the Fornax cluster exhibit significantly higher asymmetry, indicating that morphological disturbances happened during their first pericentric passage.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

      <title>The Young Ages of 70 {\mu}m-dark Clumps Inferred from Carbon Chain Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical conditions of the earliest environment of high-mass star formation are currently poorly understood. To that end, we present observations of the carbon chain molecules HC$_5$N , CCS, and HC$_7$N in the 22-25 GHz band towards 12 high-mass 70 micron-dark clumps (SMDC) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We detect HC$_5$N and CCS towards 11 of these SMDC sources. We calculate column densities and abundances relative to H$_2$ for HC$_5$N and CCS. We do not find any clear HC$_7$N detections in the 11 sources individually, but by stacking the HC$_7$N spectra, we do detect HC$_7$N on average in these sources. We also calculate the ratio of the column densities of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N using the stacked spectra of both species. We compare our measured abundances of HC$_5$N and our measured ratio of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N to the UMIST dark cloud chemistry models to constrain an age for the gas assuming a fixed volume density and temperature. The chemical models favor a chemical evolutionary age less than 1 Myr at densities of n(H2) = 2 x 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The consistent carbon-chain detections and young model-derived ages support the conclusion that these 11 70 micron-dark clumps lack high mass protostars because they are young and not because they are inefficient and incapable of high mass star formation.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $\Sigma_1$-$M_\star$ quenching boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have considered a phenomenologically motivated model in which galaxies are quenched when the energy output of the central black hole exceeds a hundred times the gravitational binding energy of the baryons in the host halo. The model reproduces the mass functions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5 and the quenching boundary on a $\Sigma_1$-stellar mass diagram. The quenching boundary arises because of the colour-morphology relation. The stellar surface density $\Sigma_1$ in the central kiloparsec is a morphological indicator. Galaxies becomes redder as $\Sigma_1$ increases until they cross the quenching boundary and enter the passive population. Mergers drive the growth of supermassive black holes and the morphological evolution that accompany the migration to the red sequence. That is the origin of the population of high-mass passive galaxies. At lower masses, passive galaxies are mainly satellites that ceased to form stars because of environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Closing in on Pop-III Stars: Constraints and Predictions Across the Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absence of direct high redshift observations poses a significant challenge in understanding the properties of first stars. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of entire stellar populations can be studied with current data. In this work we use a combination of high redshift observables in order to infer the formation and emission properties of the first stellar populations: high redshift UVLFs, the optical depth of CMB photons to reionization, hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, and measurements of the soft cosmic X-ray background. We study two minimal models of stellar population: i) a single, Pop-II, stellar population which dominates throughout Cosmic Dawn, ii) two distinct stellar populations, Pop-II and Pop-III, dominating at different times with the transition between them taken as a free parameter. We set strong constraints on the properties of Pop-II stars, and upper limits on the formation and multi-wavelength emission of Pop-III stars. After applying the constraints above, we present the viable envelopes of the 21-cm global signal with and without Pop-III stars. We identify a region in the parameter space of the two population model which predicts a global 21-cm signal distinctive from that of the single population one. A measurement of such a signal would be a strong indication for the presence of Pop-III stars at early times.</description>

      <title>Elliptical multipoles for gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing galaxies are commonly modeled with elliptical density profiles, to which angular complexity is sometimes added through a multipole expansion - encoding deformations of the elliptical iso-density contours. The formalism that is widely used in current studies and software packages, however, employs perturbations that are defined with respect to a circle. In this work, we show that this popular formulation (the "circular multipoles") leads to perturbation patterns that depend on the axis ratio and do not agree with physical expectations (from studies of galaxy isophotal shapes) when applied to profiles that are not near-circular. We propose a more appropriate formulation, the "elliptical multipoles", representing deviations from ellipticity suited for any axis ratio. We solve for the lensing potentials associated with the $m=1$ circular multipole (previously undetermined in the isothermal case), as well as the elliptical multipoles of any order $m$, assuming a near-isothermal reference profile. We implement these solutions into the lens modeling package $\mathtt{lenstronomy}$, and assess the importance of the multipole formulation by comparing flux-ratio perturbations in mock lensed systems with quadruply imaged quasars: we show that elliptical multipoles typically produce smaller flux-ratio perturbations than their circular counterparts.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES). II. Machine Learning-Based Stellar parameters for 21 million stars from the First Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar parameters for large samples of stars play a crucial role in constraining the nature of stars and stellar populations in the Galaxy. An increasing number of medium-band photometric surveys are presently used in estimating stellar parameters. In this study, we present a machine-learning approach to derive estimates of stellar parameters, including [Fe/H], logg, and Teff, based on a combination of medium-band and broad-band photometric observations. Our analysis employs data primarily sourced from the SAGE Survey , which aims to observe much of the Northern Hemisphere. We combine the $uv$-band data from SAGES DR1 with photometric and astrometric data from Gaia EDR3, and apply the random forest method to estimate stellar parameters for approximately 21 million stars. We are able to obtain precisions of 0.09 dex for [Fe/H], 0.12 dex for logg, and 70 K for Teff. Furthermore, by incorporating 2MASS and WISE infrared photometric and GALEX ultraviolet data, we are able to achieve even higher precision estimates for over 2.2 million stars. These results are applicable to both giant and dwarf stars. Building upon this mapping, we construct a foundational dataset for research on metal-poor stars, the structure of the Milky Way, and beyond. With the forthcoming release of additional bands from SAGE Survey such DDO51 and H-alpha, this versatile machine learning approach is poised to play an important role in upcoming surveys featuring expanded filter sets</description>

      <title>Environmental effects on nearby debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the effect of the ISM on debris disc occurrence rates and on the morphologies of the discs. We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory DUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical depths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically thick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local Interstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar conditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single indicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they interact with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend on the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars with higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their circumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample reaches a maximum of $\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component values, $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for larger $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the average disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ is also observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the reported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the impact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar space velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles, and radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own, they collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the occurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Multi-band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tip of red giant branch (TRGB) stars have attracted intensive attention in recent years because their $I$-band absolute magnitudes, $M_\rm I$, are often used for distance calibration in the Hubble constant measurements because of its almost independence on metallicity ([Fe/H]). However, a discrepancy exists between various studies and the theoretical stellar model predicts dependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here we present a careful study of the dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in optical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic globular clusters by the reddest color in the $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ vs. $G_{\rm RP}$ diagram, it is confirmed that $M_\rm I$ is almost constant of $-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027$ mag when $[\rm Fe/H]&lt;-1.2$, which would give $H_0=70.86\pm 1.2\pm0.9$ $\rm kms^{-1} Mp c^{-1}$ with this updated luminosity calibration for type Ia supernovae. However, for $[\rm Fe/H]&gt;-1.2$, $M_\rm I$ is found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger Hubble constant. In the optical $G_{\rm BP}, G_{\rm RP}$ and $V$ bands, the absolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in the infrared $J, H$, and $K_{\rm S}$ bands, the variation with metallicity shows an inverse tendency. In addition, the analytical relations of the color indexes with metallicity are presented, which have smaller dispersion than those derived for the corresponding absolute magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Newly Catalogued Open Star Cluster UPK~220 with Gaia DR3 and TESS: Discovering Member Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies on star clusters with the same age and initial chemical composition have gained momentum in recent years with the use of \textit{Gaia}. In addition, the discovery of new clusters with Gaia has increased the number of open clusters to be examined. Many of these discovered sources are intermediate-age open clusters and have not been analyzed in detail yet. In this study, we focused on newly cataloged open cluster UPK~220. The fundamental parameters (distance, age, metallicity and reddening) of UPK~220 were determined by analysing the variable stars within the cluster, while simultaneously constraining the parameters of the variable stars using these cluster parameters. To achieve this, we combined GaiaDR3 and TESS photometric observations. Using GaiaDR3, we derive fundamental parameters of UPK~220 through membership analyses, and with TESS, we discovered eight member variable stars. We also extracted the atmospheric parameters ($logg$, $[Fe/H]$ and $T_{\rm eff}$) for the variable stars using SED, GSP-Phot and GSP-Spec, and MESA models.</description>

      <title>Spectuner: A Framework for Automated Line Identification of Interstellar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves an overall recall of ~ 74% - 93%, and an average precision of ~ 78% - 92%. Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Neural Infalling Cloud Equations (NICE): Increasing the Efficacy of Subgrid Models and Scientific Equation Discovery using Neural ODEs and Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic systems are inherently multiphase, and understanding the roles and interactions of the various phases is key towards a more complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution. For instance, these interactions play a pivotal role in the cycling of baryons which fuels star formation. The transport and dynamics of cold clouds in their surrounding hot environment are governed by complex small scale processes (such as the interplay of turbulence and radiative cooling) that determine how the phases exchange mass, momentum and energy. Large scale models thus require subgrid prescriptions in the form of models validated on small scale simulations, which often take the form of coupled differential equations. In this work, we explore using neural ordinary differential equations which embed neural networks as terms in the model to capture an uncertain physical process. We then apply Symbolic Regression to potentially discover new insights into the physics of cloud-environment interactions. We test this on both generated mock data and actual simulation data. We also extend the neural ODE to include a secondary neural term. We show that neural ODEs in tandem with Symbolic Regression can be used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subgrid models, and/or discover the underlying equations to improve generality and scientific understanding. We highlight the potential of this scientific machine learning approach as a natural extension to the traditional modelling paradigm, both for the development of semi-analytic models and for physically interpretable equation discovery in complex non-linear systems.</description>

      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. II. Resolving the Virgo Cluster with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d $=$ 16.17 $\pm$ 0.25 (stat) $\pm$ 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a VLBI pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos (free-floating or sub-halos) and free-floating supermassive black holes in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9\,M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of new sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. By using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and contaminant objects that mimick them. Using the above constraints, we rule out 31 out of our initial 40 candidates of milli-lens systems, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we found many new candidate compact symmetric objects, which are thought to be primarily short-lived jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the Search for MIlli-LEnses (SMILE) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>

      <title>Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for [$\alpha/M$] information in Gaia BP/RP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for Gaia BP/RP spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and accompanying 'scatter' without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in Gaia XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality, without relying on stellar label correlations for stars with $T_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 5000 K, while also being sensitive to the anomalous abundances of Gaia-Enceladus stars. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry I: HST Observations and Modeling with GIGA-Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lens Foundry. We discovered $\sim 3500$ new strong gravitational lens candidates in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using residual neural networks (ResNet). We observed a subset (51) of our candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). All of them were confirmed to be strong lenses. We also briefly describe spectroscopic follow-up observations by DESI and Keck NIRES programs. From this very rich dataset, a number of studies will be carried out, including evaluating the quality of the ResNet search candidates and lens modeling. In this paper, we present our initial effort in these directions. In particular, as a demonstration, we present the lens model for DESI-165.4754-06.0423, with imaging data from HST, and lens and source redshifts from DESI and Keck NIRES, respectively. In this effort, we have applied a \emph{fully} forward-modeling Bayesian approach (GIGA-Lens), using \emph{multiple} GPUs, for the first time in both regards, to a strong lens with HST data, or any high resolution imaging.</description>
