      <title>Factorization in deep inelastic scattering at Bj\"{o}rken limit: Reduction to (1+1)D integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structure functions in deep inelastic scattering processes (DIS) at Bj\"{o}rken limit and found that they are factorized into the longitudinal and transversal parts. We see that the longitudinal part can be linked to exact form factors calculated earlier in 1+1 dimensional integrable quantum field theories, such as sine-Gordon model. We extract asymptotic of Form-factors at small Bj\"{o}rken parameter $x$ and compare it with experimental data of HERA and ZEUS collaborations on Deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering. We observe the factorization of the structure functions $F_2(x,q^2)$ and find out its power behavior on scaling parameter $x$.</description>

      <title>First constraints on QCD axion dark matter using James Webb Space Telescope observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the first constraints on QCD axion dark matter using measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope. By utilizing publicly available MIRI and NIRSpec blank-sky observations, originally collected for sky subtraction purposes, I derive strong limits on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ in the mass range 0.1-4 eV. These constraints improve upon previous studies by more than two orders of magnitude for a range of masses. This analysis underscores the potential of blank-sky observations as a powerful tool for constraining dark matter models and demonstrates how astrophysical missions can be repurposed for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>From obstacle to opportunity: uncovering the silver lining of pileup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of evidence for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles might be due to their light mass and very weak interactions, as exemplified by BSM long-lived particles (LLPs). Such particles can be produced from $B$ or $D$ hadron decays. Typically, the high values of pileup (PU) in hadron colliders are expected to pose a major challenge in light new physics searches. We propose a fresh perspective that counters this conventional wisdom: instead of viewing PU solely as an impediment, we highlight its potential benefits in searches for light LLPs from $B$ or $D$ hadron decays at HL-LHC and FCC-hh. In particular, certain forward detectors in LHC experiments, such as the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC), which are currently not utilized for LLP searches, can be repurposed with strategic modifications to play a crucial role in this endeavor. Leveraging a combination of forward and central detectors, along with smart strategies for triggering and offline analysis, we demonstrate the potential for exploring light LLPs in high PU scenarios.</description>

      <title>Testing the QCD formation time with reconstructed parton splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy elementary collisions the space-time ordering of parton branching processes is not accessible experimentally. In contrast, in heavy-ion collisions, parton showers interact with a spatially extended dense medium. This sets a reference length scale with respect to which the space-time ordering may be analysed. Here, we explore the possibility of identifying experimental signatures of the QCD formation time, $\tau_f$, on the level of a single parton splitting. Since heavy flavour offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium, we focus on the $g\to c\bar{c}$ splitting. Combining adapted versions of the Cambridge-Aachen and FlavourCone jet finding algorithms with grooming techniques, we show how the kinematics of such splittings can be reconstructed with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons, and how the formation time distribution of parton splittings can be constructed therefrom. Medium modification leads to a characteristic modification of this $\tau_f$ distribution. This effect can be used to construct experimentally-accessible ratios of $\tau_f$ distributions, in which the sensitivity of the medium modification to the QCD formation time becomes measurable.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions: Confronting COHERENT and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complementarity between COHERENT and LHC searches in testing neutrino non-standard interactions through the completion of the effective field theory approach within a $Z'$ simplified model. Our results show that LHC bounds are strongly dependent on the $Z'$ mass, with relatively large masses excluding regions in the parameter space that are allowed by COHERENT data and its future expectations. We demonstrate that the combination of low energy and high energy experiments results on a viable approach to break NSI degeneracies within the context of simplified models.</description>

      <title>NNPDFpol2.0: unbiased global determination of polarized PDFs and their uncertainties at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NNPDFpol2.0, a new set of collinear helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton based on legacy measurements of structure functions in inclusive neutral-current longitudinally polarised deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and of W -boson, single-inclusive, and di-jet production asymmetries in longitudinally polarised proton-proton collisions. The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>The ${\phi NN,J/\psi NN,\eta_c NN}$ systems based on HAL QCD interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of bound states and resonances in the ${\phi NN, J/\psi NN, \eta_c NN}$ systems using HAL QCD interactions for ${\phi N, J/\psi N}$, and ${\eta_c N}$. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"odinger equation and find no resonances or bound states in the ${J/\psi NN}$ and ${\eta_c NN}$ systems. We estimate the interaction between charmonium and nuclei, concluding that the $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ is likely to bind with ${}^3\mathrm{H}$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}$, ${}^4\mathrm{He}$, and heavier nuclei. For the $\phi NN$ system, the lattice QCD $\phi N\left({ }^2 S_{1 / 2}\right)$ interaction is absent. We combine the $\phi p$ correlation function analysis and HAL QCD results in Model A. We assume the spin-spin interactions for $J/\psi N$ and $\phi N$ systems are inversely proportional to their masses in Model B. Model A predicts a stronger $\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties. In contrast, these states are very loosely bound in Model B, with binding energies below 1 MeV and an existent probability of about 60\% when parameter uncertainties are considered. In both models, there exist very loosely bound $I(J^P) = 0(2^-)$ three-body states which resemble a $\phi$-d atom with the $\phi$ meson surrounding the deuteron, but their existences are sensitive to parameter uncertainties. No bound states or resonances are found in the isovector $I(J^P) = 1(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ system.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Fully-heavy tetraquarks in the vacuum and in a hot environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal behavior of quarkonia and fully-heavy tetraquark states associated to the charmonium, bottomonium and bottom-charmonium mass spectra. The starting point is the Schr\"odinger formalism with a vacuum Cornell-like potential. The spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor contributions are also considered to describe the structure of the vacuum quarkonia $Q\bar Q$ spectra ($Q$ denoting $c,b$ quarks). The parameters of the model are fixed using the experimental data of the $Q\bar Q$ states. After that, this formalism is extended to the fully-heavy tetraquark states within the $1^3 S_1$ axial diquark--$1^3 S_1$ axial antidiquark configuration $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$, and their vacuum mass spectra are obtained and compared to the experimental data recently obtained. Our predictions support the interpretation of the $X(6600)$ (or $X(6552)$), $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ states as the radially-excited $T_{4c}(n^1S_0)$ configurations with $n=2,3,4$. In the sequence, we evaluate the mass spectra behavior in a thermal medium, by introducing a modified temperature-dependent Cornell potential. As a consequence, this formalism enables us to get some insight into the dissociation mechanism of $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$ states caused by a thermal medium, and into the temperature range at which the tetraquark states might be formed. We find that these structures cannot be formed in the thermal medium when the system has a temperature higher than about twice the critical temperature. These findings may be useful to better understand the features of the exotics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Gluonic structure from instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instanton vacuum provides an effective description of chiral symmetry breaking by local topological fluctuations of the gauge fields, as observed in lattice QCD simulations. The resulting effective dynamics at momenta below $1/\bar\rho \approx$ 0.6 GeV explains the basic features of light-quark correlation functions and is used extensively in studies of hadron structure. The instanton fields also make definite contributions to the gluonic structure of light hadrons, as expressed in the matrix elements of composite quark-gluon or gluon operators. The article reviews the gluonic structure of light hadrons (nucleon, pion) induced by instantons. This includes: (i) twist-2 parton distributions and momentum sum rule; (ii) twist-3 angular momentum and spin-orbit interactions; (iii) twist-3 and 4 quark-gluon correlations and power corrections; (iv) trace anomaly and hadron mass decomposition; (v) scalar gluon form factors and mechanical properties; (vi) axial anomaly and pseudoscalar gluon form factors. It also discusses possible further applications of the methods and recent developments including gauge field configurations beyond instantons.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decays $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow \Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decays of $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow\Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in all lepton channels. To do this, we first obtain the form factors defining these decay modes within the framework of QCD sum rules. Then, using the transferred momentum squared-dependent form factors, we compute the decay widths and branching fractions for all lepton channels and compare the results of our calculations with those obtained from other theoretical methods. We also estimate the branching ratios and the ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels to provide useful information for future experiments may be planned at different Colliders. Such comparison will provide valuable information about the consistency/inconsistency of the SM theory predictions with experimental data in weak semileptonic single heavy baryon decays.</description>

Abstract: We conducted a study using the modified Godfrey-Isgur (MGI) quark model and quark pair creation model (QPC model) to investigate the spectrum and two body strong decays of the newly discovered $\kappa$(2600) meson in LHCb collaboration. Our analysis revealed that this resonant can be assigned as the fourth radial excitation within the $0^{+}$ light strange meson family. Furthermore, we predicted additional radial excitations in this meson family and systematically discussed their spectra, decay behaviors, and branching ratios. These results provide critical guidance for future to identify their signatures in experiments</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}$ in light-front quark model with nonvalence contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive semilpetonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda/n) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}~(\ell=e,\mu)$ within the standard model by using the light-front quark model (LFQM). The form factor behaviors are obtained from the effective treatment of nonvalence contributions in addition to the valence ones in the Drell-Yan-West frame due to the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. Based on these form factors, we find that the decay branching ratios of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda e^{+} \nu_{e},\,\Lambda \mu^{+} \nu_{e} ,\, n e^{+} \nu_{e},\, n \mu^{+} \nu_{e})$ are about $ (3.39,\,3.21,\,0.36,\,0.35)\%$ with the non-valence contributions, which are consistent with the recent experimental measurements at BESIII. Furthermore, we use the experimental data to fit the $\beta$ parameters in the baryonic distribution amplitudes under the LFQM, resulting in ($\beta_{\Lambda_{c}},\beta_{\Lambda}, \beta_{n})= (0.58\pm0.08, 0.52\pm0.08,0.44\pm0.04)$.</description>

      <title>$B \rightarrow TT$ decays in the QCD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the nonleptonic two-body $B$ decays into two tensor mesons (including $a_2(1320)$, $K^*_2(1430)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f^\prime_2(1525)$, denoted generically as $T$) are investigated in the QCD factorization approach. The branching ratios, longitudinal polarization fractions, and CP asymmetries are predicted systematically. It is found that, from the perspective of central values, the branching ratios for the decays $B \rightarrow \{a_2 f^\prime_2, f_2 f^\prime_2\}$, $\{a_2f_2, f_2 f_2\}$ and $\{f_2 K^*_2, K^*_2f^\prime_2\}$ are at the order of $10^{-8}$, $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-6}$, respectively. The branching ratios for the decays into $\{a_2 a_2, K^*_2 K^*_2\}$ and $a_2 K^*_2$ are at the order of $10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ and $10^{-7} - 10^{-6}$, respectively. The longitudinal polarization fractions are approximately $0.7-1$. Especially, for the $\bar{B}^0/B^0 \rightarrow \{K^{*-}_2 K^{*+}_2, f^\prime_2 f^\prime_2\}$ decays, the longitudinal polarization fractions are equal to $1$. The CP asymmetry for the $B^\pm \rightarrow a^\pm_2 f_2$ modes is most significant, roughly $-22\%$. The CP asymmetries for the decays $B \rightarrow \{a_2 f^\prime_2, f_2 f^\prime_2, f^\prime_2 f^\prime_2\}$ and $\bar{B}^0/B^0 \rightarrow K^{*-}_2 K^{*+}_2$ are equal to zero. Our results may be tested by more precise experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Family Unification in a Six Dimensional Theory with an Orthogonal Gauge Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of family unification, which is a six dimensional $SO(20)$ gauge theory with a single fermion in the spinorial representation. After compactification to five dimensions, our model gives a five dimensional model where the Standard Model Higgs field is unified into the fifth component of the five dimensional gauge field as well as three generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a single spinor field.</description>

      <title>Dark Spin-2 Field Solitons as a Source of Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-$s$ light dark boson particles can exhibit wave-like behavior, capable of forming long-lived, coherent, spatially localized structures known as solitons. This work considers the possibility that a light spin-2 particle might be part of or all the dark matter content of the Universe, which could result in a significant fraction of solitons existing today in galactic halos. If these dark matter particles interact with electromagnetism through dimension-6 operators, the solitons may experience parametric resonance of photons triggered by the surrounding electromagnetic field. We explore the feasibility and key characteristics of this electromagnetic radiation, as well as the potential for detection through soliton mergers using ground-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Gluon gravitational form factors of the proton in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton using a light-front spectator model based on soft-wall AdS/QCD, where the active parton is a gluon. The model parameters are determined by fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution function to the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Subsequently, we predict the polarized gluon distribution, finding consistency with global analyses. Our predictions for the gluon GFFs show good agreement with recent lattice QCD simulations and experimental extractions. Using these gluon GFFs, we compute the contribution of the gluon to the proton mass and mechanical radii. We also analyze the gluonic contribution to the two-dimensional Galilean densities, including energy density, radial and tangential pressure, isotropic pressure, and pressure anisotropy of the proton.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic $A_4$ modular invariance for fermion masses and mixing in SU(5) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the fermion flavor structures using modular invariance is a challenging task in the framework of quark-lepton unification. Building on recent applications of modular symmetry in non-supersymmetric models, we propose the first renormalizable $SU(5)$ grand unified theory incorporating level 3 non-holomorphic modular symmetry, $\Gamma_3 \simeq A_4$. This framework constrains Yukawa couplings to polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms, significantly reducing the number of free parameters while enhancing the predictive power of the models. We present a comprehensive analysis of fermion masses and mixing while tackling key GUT queries such as gauge coupling unification and proton decay. Beyond the minimal $SU(5)$ framework, the Higgs sector incorporates the $45_H$ dimensional Higgs field crucial in differentiating the masses of down quarks and charged leptons, and the fermion sector is extended with three right-handed neutrinos enabling neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We analyze two benchmark models with distinct modular weight and $A_4$ charge assignments. The predicted effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta \beta}$ values align with current neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, and the effective neutrino mass $m_\beta$ is within the reach of future beta decay searches. The predicted sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_i$, satisfies the upper bound set by recent cosmological observations. The gauge coupling unification is achieved through a light scalar triplet $\phi_3 \sim (3,3,-1/3)$ and a scalar octet $\phi_5 \sim (8,2,1/2)$ belonging to the $45_H$ Higgs, while proton decay constraints require a highly suppressed Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Does finetuning make $D$-term contributions smaller in natural grand unified theories with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the natural grand unified theory (GUT) with spontaneous supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, focusing on the contribution to sfermion and Higgs masses. Natural GUTs solve various problems in SUSY GUTs with the natural assumption that all terms allowed by $SO(10)\times U(1)_A$ symmetry are introduced with $O(1)$ coefficients. %, solve various the problems in SUSY GUTs. It is also possible to introduce spontaneous SUSY breaking in the natural GUT. This scenario predicts $D$-term contribution to sfermion and Higgs masses dominates the $F$-term contribution, that potentially leads to the SUSY flavor problem. Fortunately, it also predicts high-scale SUSY, which avoids the SUSY flavor problem but leads to the instability of the %need for fine-tuning to obtain the electroweak scale. The $D$-term domination results in the superheavy Higgsino unless the $D$-term contribution becomes comparable with the $F$-term contribution. We discuss whether it is possible to suppress the $D$-term contribution while maintaining the $F$-term contribution through the tuning of $O(1)$ coefficients in the natural GUT with spontaneous SUSY breaking. Our results indicate that it is impossible. %the D-term is proportional to the F-term and its derivatives, making it difficult to suppress the D-term independently. This also suggests that the mass spectrum of the sfermions can be predicted by the $D$-term contributions, and that the Higgsino is not a candidate for dark matter in the scenario.</description>

      <title>Exploring Physics beyond the Standard Model with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos, being elusive subatomic particles having only weak interactions, provide an ideal platform to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present era of neutrino physics, various experiments are focusing towards the precision measurements of the oscillation parameters. Hence, various new physics scenarios which can affect the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter, be in need of careful investigation. There is a slight tension at the level of $2 \sigma$ between the recently reported results on the CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ by NOvA and T2K experiments, which can be attributed to the role of non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the propagation of neutrinos through matter. Another interesting possibility is that though neutrinos are electrically neutral, they can possess electromagnetic properties such as electric and magnetic dipole moments in the presence of new physics, and the neutrino oscillation experiments can put limits on them. In this work, we will focus on these two aspects and show how they can be used to probe the nature of new physics from model-building perspectives.</description>

      <title>RelExt: A New Dark Matter Tool for the Exploration of Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the {\tt C++} program \texttt{RelExt} for Standard Model (SM) extensions that feature a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The tool allows to efficiently scan the parameter spaces of these models to find parameter combinations that lead to relic density values which are compatible with the measured value within the uncertainty specified by the user. The code computes the relic density for freeze-out (co-)annihilation processes. The user can choose between several pre-installed models or any arbitrary other model featuring a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, by solely providing the corresponding \texttt{FeynRules} model files. The code automatically generates the required (co-)annihilation amplitudes and thermally averaged cross sections, including the total widths in the $s$-channel mediators, and solves the Boltzmann equation to determine the relic density. It can easily be linked to other tools like e.g.~\texttt{ScannerS} to check for the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, or to \texttt{BSMPT} to investigate the phase history of the model and possibly related gravitational waves signals.</description>

      <title>3+1 neutrino mixings model with $A_4$ triplet Majorana neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixings model using an $A_4$ triplet right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$ and a singlet eV-scale sterile neutrino under $A_4\times Z_3 \times Z_2$ discrete symmetry. Four scalar flavons are considered to reproduce neutrino oscillation parameters within the experimental 3$\sigma$ range. The model also studies the effective mass parameter in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Deviation from $\mu-\tau$ symmetry in the active neutrino mass matrix is generated through an antisymmetric interaction of $\nu_R$. This model successfully explains active-sterile neutrino mixings consistent with the cosmological upper bound on the sum of active neutrino mass $\sum m_i &lt; 0.113$ eV (0.145 eV) in NH(IH).</description>

      <title>Isospin-violating decay of $D^{*}_{s}\to D_{s} \pi^0$ with intermediate meson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isospin-violating decay $D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}$ in an effective Lagrangian approach by taking into account the corrections from the one-loop transitions. Namely, We distinguish the transition mechanisms of the long-distance interactions through the intermediate meson loops from the short-distance interactions through the $\eta-\pi^{0}$ mixing at the tree level. In our approach the higher order corrections to the isospin-violating effects can involve the intermediate $D^{(*)}$ and $K^{(*)}$ scatterings. We find that the contributions from the destructive interference of intermediate meson loops via $D^{(*)0}(c\bar{u}){K}^{(*)+}(u\bar{s})$ and $D^{(*)+}(c\bar{d}){K}^{(*)0}(d\bar{s})$ rescatterings are significant. Within the commonly accepted ultra-violet (UV) cutoff range we obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma[D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}] = 9.92^{+0.76}_{-0.66}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the degree of hydrodynamic behaviour in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in O+O collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an experimentally accessible observable to distinguish whether collective behaviour builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or through few rescatterings in a non-equilibrated dilute medium. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on the total resulting anisotropic flow. We validate the ability of our proposed observable to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory in the Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA). As a proof of concept, we extract the degree of hydrodynamization for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC from experimental data.</description>

      <title>D-shell mixing in light baryons and its effect on the orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard description of the nucleon in the non-relativistic quark model is an $1S,L=0$ state without orbital motion. Yet, there are several indications from phenomenology that an admixture of states with nonzero orbital motion maybe substantial. In this paper we focus on the ``second shell" of the nucleon excitations (D-shell), for which we give a modern description of the wave functions. We follow it by investigating what we call a ``maximal mixing" scenario, assuming a hypothetical long-range tensor force.
  We give the explicit wave functions for all states, before and after mixing, and re-assess many predictions such as the magnetic moments, the standard and transitional form-factors from the nucleon to $N^*$. Unexpectedly, in this scenario we can reproduce the long-puzzling features of the Roper resonance $N^*( 1440)$. But even in this extreme case, the
  admixture of the $1D,L=2$ state to a nucleon remains significantly smaller
  than expected from phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections on vortical spin polarization in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative corrections on spin polarization of relativistic fermions induced by vortical fields in thermal-equilibrium QCD matter at weak coupling. Such corrections stem from the self-energy gradients in quantum kinetic theory, which are further obtained by a more systematic and general approach through the Keldysh equation. By applying the hard-thermal-loop approximation, we obtain new corrections upon the spin-polarization spectrum and also the axial-charge current in connection to the axial/chiral vortical effect for massive quarks up to the leading order of the QCD coupling. Further influence on spin alignment of vector mesons from similar effects is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) Higgs Inflation is a novel approach to relate the Higgs boson and its interaction with Electroweak gauge bosons with cosmic inflation, with the potential of solving both the fine-tuning issues in the Higgs mass and inflationary potentials. In this work, we present a linear perturbation analysis of the minimal implementation of pNG Higgs inflation using the symmetry coset SU($5$)/SO($5$). Similar to Chromo-natural inflation, this model exhibits a period of instability in the tensor modes that exponentially enhance left-handed gravitational waves. Thus, large Chern-Simons couplings $\beta \gtrsim 6 \times 10^8$ and decay constants $f\gtrsim1\times10^{18}~\mathrm{GeV}$ are required to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ to be compatible with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement. These large couplings also cause an overproduction of the scalar modes, making the minimal construction of pNG Higgs inflation disfavored by CMB observations. However, this tension could potentially be relieved by considering multi-field inflation. The pNG Higgs construction naturally contains multiple scalar fields via the interplay of spontaneously broken global and gauge symmetries. The rich structure enables a broad range of multi-field inflation, and we conclude by briefly discussing this possibility and future work.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high frequency spikes of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximal frequency domain of the cosmic gravitons falls in the THz region where, without conflicting with the existing phenomenological bounds, only few particles with opposite (comoving) three-momenta are produced. Although any reliable scrutiny of the ultra-high frequency spikes should include all the sources of late-time suppression at lower and intermediate frequencies, some relevant properties of the averaged multiplicities and of the spectral energy density can be derived within a reduced set of approximations that may become invalid as the frequency decreases well below the Hz. The accuracy of these concurrent approaches is assessed from the properties of the transition matrix that relates the late-time spectra to the values of the mode functions during an inflationary stage. In the obtained framework the bounds on the post-inflationary expansion rate are swiftly deduced and compare quite well with the ones including a more faithful numerical treatment. It also follows that the timeline of the post-inflationary expansion rate might be observationally accessible, in the years to come, provided the electromechanical detectors (like microwave cavities or waveguides) operating between the MHz and the THz shall eventually reach sensitivities in the chirp amplitudes which are (at least) twelve orders of magnitude smaller than the ones experimentally attainable in the audio band (i.e. between few Hz and the kHz).</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Particle Mediated Dark Matter and Neutron Star Properties in the QHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the ALP-mediated dark matter (DM) model on neutron star properties using the Quantum Hadrodynamics model (QHD). Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f &lt; 0.05$ MeV and $m_{\chi} &lt; 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model.</description>

      <title>Effect of transverse momentum conservation and flow on symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric cumulants can improve our understanding of the joint probability distribution function $ P\left ( v_{m},v_{n},v_{k}, \dots,\Psi _{m},\Psi _{n},\Psi _{k},\dots \right )$, potentially offering new insights into the nature of the fluctuations of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the four-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, six-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nsc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ originating from transverse momentum conservation, collective flow, and the interplay between the two effects are calculated. Our results are consistent with the ATLAS data using the subevent cumulant method and the simulations using the realistic Monte Carlo models of iEBE-VISHNU and HIJING, facilitating a more profound understanding of the origins of these symmetric cumulants in small systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(\kappa\)}{kappa}-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Constraining the parameters of heavy dark matter and memory-burdened primordial black holes with DAMPE electron measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based instrument for detecting GeV-TeV cosmic rays and gamma rays. High-energy cosmic rays could be emitted from several dark matter candidates theoretically, such as the heavy dark matter (HDM) and the primordial black holes (PBHs). HDM particles with a mass of $&gt;100\,{\rm TeV}$ could decay into $\gtrsim 10\,{\rm TeV}$ electron/positron pairs. PBHs with a mass of $\lesssim 10^{10}\,{\rm g}$ would survive to the present day if the Hawking radiation is significantly suppressed due to the memory burden effect and can also lead to the emission of $\gtrsim 10\,{\rm TeV}$ electrons. In this work, we use the DAMPE electron measurements to obtain the constraints on the decay lifetime $\tau$ of HDM and the entropy index $k$ of memory-burdened PBHs at $95 \%$ confidence level. The constraints on the fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ are also derived with a fixed $k$. Furthermore, the high-energy tail of the DAMPE electron spectrum shows a sign of going upwards, possibly suggesting the presence of an additional component; we discuss if this spectral behavior is real, which parameter space is required for it to be attributed to HDM or PBH. We will show that the required parameters have been constrained by existing limits.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and spin alignment of $\phi$ meson in QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the spin alignment of a vector meson is predicted to be correlated with its spectral properties, we study the spectral properties of the $\phi$ meson using two microscopic Lagrangians based either on chiral effective field theory or the quark-meson model. We calculate the self-energies and spectral functions of the $\phi$ meson for these two Lagrangians at the one-loop level within the Matsubara formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory, employing various parameters to represent different physical scenarios. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained, connecting the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson to hydrodynamic gradients. Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior in their $p_T$ and centrality dependence, similar to those observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Double-mixing CP violation in $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a long-overlooked CP violation observable, termed double-mixing CP violation, which arises from the interference between two neutral meson oscillating paths involved in a decay chain. The double-mixing CP violation is beneficial for the precise test of the Standard Model CKM mechanism, as it offers the potential to extract weak phases without pollution from strong dynamics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the double-mixing CP violation, we perform phenomenological analyses on the cascade decays of the $B^0_d$ and $B^0_s$ mesons. Our results show that the double-mixing CP violation can be very significant in certain decay channels, such as $B^0_s \to \rho^0 K \to \rho^0(\pi^-\ell^+\nu_\ell)$. In addition, we employ the decay process $B^0_d \to D^0 K \to (K^-\pi^+)(\pi\ell\nu)$ to demonstrate that the involved strong and weak phases can be directly determined from the experimental data without any theoretical inputs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the processes $g\to W{+}\,q'$ and $q\to Z{+}\,q$ and derive the respective splitting functions as functions of two kinematic variables: the longitudinal momentum fraction $z$ and transverse momentum $p_T$ of the produced bosons with respect to the parent quark. We take into account kinematic (phase space) restrictions connected with nonzero masses of the gauge bosons and with limited initial energy. We separately consider three different polarization states of the bosons.</description>

Abstract: The structure of hadronic form factors at high energies and their deviations from perturbative quantum chromodynamics provide insight on nonperturbative dynamics. Using an approach that is consistent with dispersion relations, we construct a model that simultaneously accounts for the pion wave function, gluonic exchanges, and quark Reggeization. In particular, we find that quark Reggeization can be investigated at high energies by studying scaling violation of the form factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}^M/\mu_B$ is around $10^{-20}$ $\sim$ $10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>Interstellar medium gas heating by primordial black holes and dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Leo T dwarf galaxy has been utilized to investigate the heating of interstellar medium gas by both primordial black holes (PBHs) and dark matter (DM) particles. Previous studies have typically assumed that either PBHs or DM particles are responsible for heating the interstellar medium gas. In contrast, this study considers the simultaneous contribution of both PBHs and DM particles to the heating process.
  If both PBHs and dark photons heat the gas in Leo T, a stringent constraint on the PBH fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}=\rho_{\rm PBH}/\rho_{\rm DM}$ is obtained for $4 \lesssim M_{\rm PBH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^2$, where $\rho_{\rm PBH}$, $\rho_{\rm DM}$, represent the energy densities of PBHs and DM, respectively, and $M_{\rm PBH}$, and $M_\odot$ denote the masses of PBHs and Sun, respectively. Conversely, if both PBHs and millicharged particles heat the gas, it becomes challenging to impose a more significant constraint on the PBH fraction than previously achieved, due to the very small allowed values of charge parameters within the model.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space (CFT$_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel relaxation time approximation for kinetic theory with spin which takes into account the nonlocality of particle collisions. In particular, it models the property of the microscopic nonlocal collision term to vanish in global, but not in local equilibrium. We study the asymptotic distribution function obtained as the solution of the Boltzmann equation within the nonlocal relaxation time approximation in the limit of small gradients and short relaxation time. We show that the resulting polarization agrees with the one obtained from the Zubarev formalism for a certain value of a coefficient that determines the time scale on which orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. This coefficient can be identified with a parameter related to the pseudo gauge choice in the Zubarev formalism. Finally, we demonstrate how the nonlocal collision term generates polarization from vorticity by studying a nonrelativistic rotating cylinder both from kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches, which are shown to be equivalent in this example.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. The decays to $DD$ and $BB$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilations of $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $ m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(140 \pm 13)~ \mathrm{MeV }$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

Abstract: Elastic light-by-light(LbL) scattering, one of the most fascinating processes in the Standard Model(SM), has recently been observed in the ultraperipheral collisions(UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions in the Atlas and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider LHC. Recognizing that the incident quasi-real photons in LbL scattering are strongly linearly polarized, we re-investigate the LbL scattering in UPCs by incorporating the joint dependence of the impact parameter and transverse momenta of the incident photons. We show that the linear polarization of incident photons generates a sizable $\cos2\phi$-type azimuthal modulation, which awaits the test in future LHC and EIC experiments.</description>

      <title>Controlling the polarization and vortex charge of $\gamma$ photons via nonlinear Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy vortex $\gamma$ photons have significant applications in many fields, however, their generation and angular momentum manipulation are still great challenges. Here, we first investigated the generation of vortex $\gamma$ photons with controllable spin and orbital angular momenta via nonlinear Compton scattering of two-color counter-rotating circularly polarized (CP) laser fields. The radiation probabilities of vortex photons are calculated using the semiclassical approach that resolves angular momenta of emitted photons. We find that the angular momenta transferred to emitted photons are determined by the dominating photon absorption channel, leading to a structured spectrum with alternations in helicity and twist directions. By tuning the relative intensity ratio of the two-color CP laser fields, %the preferred photon absorption channel can be enhanced, providing the polarization and vortex charge of the emitted $\gamma$ photons can be controlled, enabling the generation of circularly polarized vortex $\gamma$ photons with a user-defined polarization and topological charge, which may have a plenty of applications in nuclear physics, astrophysics, particle physics, etc.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin correlation of back-to-back dihadron in unpolarized collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin correlation of back-to-back dihadron emerges in unpolarized high-energy collision, empowering unpolarized experiments to shed light on the spin-dependent fragmentation functions. This work investigates the transverse spin correlation of back-to-back dihadron in unpolarized $e^+e^-$, $pp$, and $\gamma p$ collisions, which serves as a novel probe of the chiral-odd fragmentation function $H_{1T}(z)$. We compute the transverse spin correlation at the partonic level and establish a connection with helicity amplitudes. Measuring this observable in future experiments can reveal valuable information on the hadronization of transversely polarized quarks.</description>

      <title>Energy-Enhanced Dimension Eight SMEFT Effects in VBF Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Higgs boson production via vector boson fusion at the LHC, focusing on the process $pp \to H + jj$ and capturing the leading energy-enhanced contributions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to order $1/\Lambda^4$. Employing energy-scaling arguments, we predict the magnitude of each higher-dimensional operator's contribution. Utilizing the geometric formulation of SMEFT, our analysis incorporates dimension-eight operators not previously considered. We find that the kinematics of vector boson fusion - characterized by two highly forward jets - tend to suppress contributions from higher-dimensional operators, requiring a lower scale $\Lambda$ for SMEFT effects to become observable. This suggests that the SMEFT remains valid for lower $\Lambda$ than expected. Combined with the fact that LEP constrains the dimension-six operators with the most considerable impact on vector boson fusion, a regime exists where dimension-eight operators can have significant effects. In many cases, these dimension-eight operators also influence associated production processes like $pp \to H V(jj)$, though differences in analysis cuts and kinematics mean this is not always the case. Our findings provide insights that could refine the search for SMEFT signals in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Boosted Dark Matter Driven by Cosmic Rays and Diffuse Supernova Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection of light dark matter can be significantly enhanced by up-scattering of dark matter with energetic particles in the cosmic ambient. This boosted dark matter flux can reach kinetic energies up to tens of MeV, while the typical kinetic energies of GeV mass dark matter particles in the Milky Way halo are of the order of keV. Dark matter boosted by energetic diffuse supernova background neutrinos can be detected only through nuclear or electron scattering in ground-based detectors requiring a non-zero interaction of dark matter with nucleon or electron, in addition to its interaction with neutrino. However, in the presence of dark matter-nucleon (electron) interaction, the scattering of dark matter with cosmic rays is unavoidable. Thus, we consider boosted dark matter resulting from diffuse supernova neutrinos as well as cosmic protons (electrons) considering both energy-dependent and energy-independent scattering cross-sections between dark matter and standard model particles. We explore this scenario in dark matter detectors such as XENONnT and neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande.</description>

Abstract: Absolute values of the neutrino mass are not known still now although their upper bounds are constrained through several experiments and observations. Recent analyses of cosmological observations present severe constraint on the sum of neutrino masses. It might suggest an interesting possibility for the absolute values of neutrino mass and their ordering. In this paper, taking it as a useful hint, we study possible neutrino models with a zero mass eigenvalue from a view point of neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. We focus our study on the seesaw type mass generation by making a certain assumption for origin of right-handed neutrino mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis on flavour anomalies in semileptonic rare $B$-meson decays using an effective field theory approach and assuming that new physics affects only one generation in the interaction basis and non-universal mixing effects are generated by the rotation to the mass basis. A global fit to experimental data is performed, focusing on LFU ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $R_{J/\psi}$ and branching ratios that exhibit tensions with Standard Model predictions on $B \rightarrow K^{(*)} \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays. We use a Machine Learning Montecarlo algorithm in our analysis. Comparing three different scenarios, we show that the one that introduces only mixing between the second and third quark generations and no mixing in the lepton sector, as well as independent coefficients for the singlet and triplet four fermion effective operators, provides the best fit to experimental data. A comparison with previous results is performed.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamically assisted Schwinger effect, the generation of fermion-antifermion pairs in vacuum under a strong, slow-varying field and a weak, high-frequency field, has become a promising avenue to probe the vacuum structure and the nonlinear dynamics of QED. However, the role of axial fields in this phenomenon has remained underexplored. This study aims at analyzing how spatial axial fields influence particle production in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect. Employing the high-frequency effective theory based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion, we demonstrate that a spatial axial field can occur as the effective field of a circular polarized high-frequency plane wave and significantly increase the number of fermions produced across different timescales. This enhancement offers both theoretical insights and useful tools for the experimental implementation of the Schwinger effect.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_{c}\to \chi_{cJ}$ ($J=0,1,2$) and $B_{c}\to h_{c}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the calculated vector and axial vector form factors, we directly study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}l \bar{\nu}_l, h_{c}l \bar{\nu}_l$ $(l=e, \mu$ and $\tau)$ and analyze the nonleptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}\pi^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{-}, \chi_{cJ}\rho^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{*-}$, $B_{c}^{-}\to h_{c}\pi^{-}, h_{c}K^{-}, h_{c}\rho^{-}, h_{c}K^{*-}$ by using the naive factorization approach (NFA). These results can provide more information to understand the properties of $B_{c}$ meson and $P$-wave charmonia and to study the heavy quark dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities using the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel and higher resolution using renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We perform analysis of the small x non-linear evolution equation formulated in momentum space supplemented by higher order terms. The equation is defined in wide range of transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum fraction extending previous studies performed in \cite{Kutak:2003bd,Kutak:2004ym}. The linear part of the equation is motivated by the renormalization group improved small x approach which accounts for resummation of higher orders, and includes collinear splitting function and kinematical constraint. The solution to the equation is then used to perform the fit to Deep Inelastic Scattering reduced cross section data.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Decay Mechanisms of $1^{-+}$ Hybrid States in Light Meson Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of exotic mesons, which transcend the conventional quark-antiquark framework, is pivotal for advancing our understanding of QCD and the strong interaction. Among these, states possessing the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, such as $\pi_1(1600)$, $\pi_1(2015)$, and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$, have attracted significant attention due to their potential hybrid nature, which involves gluonic excitations. However, the physical interpretation of these states remains contentious, primarily due to inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations regarding their decay widths and mass spectra. To address these challenges, we employ a potential model inspired by SU$(3)$ lattice gauge theory to calculate the masses of light-flavor $1^{-+}$ hybrid states and utilize the constituent gluon model to analyze their strong decay properties. Our mass calculations suggest that while the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ masses are in close agreement with the predicted hybrid states, the corresponding decay widths for $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\pi_1(2015)$ do not support their classification as hybrids, implying alternative interpretations, such as tetraquark or molecular configurations. Conversely, the $\eta_1(1855)$ is consistent with a mixed hybrid state composed of $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})g/\sqrt{2}$ and $s\bar{s}g$ components, with mixing angles ranging from $17.7^\circ$ to $84.2^\circ$. Additionally, we predict the masses and decay widths of yet-unobserved isoscalar and excited hybrid states, providing valuable targets for future experimental searches. This study not only clarifies the hybrid nature of certain exotic mesons but also contributes to the systematic classification of hybrid states within the meson nonet, thereby enhancing our comprehension of exotic hadronic states.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the recent findings regarding inverse phase transitions in the early universe, we present the first natural realisation of this phenomenon within a supersymmetry-breaking sector. We demonstrate that inverse hydrodynamics, which is characterized by the fluid being aspirated by the bubble wall rather than being pushed or dragged, is actually not limited to a phase of (re)heating but can also occur within the standard cooling cosmology. Through a numerical analysis of the phase transition, we establish a simple and generic criterion to determine its hydrodynamics based on the generalised pseudo-trace. Our results provide a proof of principle highlighting the need to account for these new fluid solutions when considering cosmological phase transitions and their phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>A Classical Interpretation of the Nonrelativistic Quark Potential Model: Color Charge Definition and the Meson Mass-Radius Relationship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing quark interactions, and various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, there is no direct classical analogy for hadronic structures.This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux.Furthermore, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate the key parameters of our model using available data from several heavy mesons. We then extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states, obtaining structural radii that show good agreement with the root mean square (RMS) radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon in a meson dominance approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization for the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Sigma_b$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we compute the masses and light-front wave functions of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and its isospin triplet counterparts $\Sigma_b^+$, $\Sigma_b^0$, and $\Sigma_b^-$ using a light-front effective Hamiltonian in the leading Fock sector. These wave functions are obtained as eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian, which incorporates the one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. With the quark masses and the couplings as adjustable parameters, the computed masses are set within the experimental range. The resulting predictions for their electromagnetic properties align well with other theoretical calculations. Additionally, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these baryons are obtained for the first time, with gluon and sea quark distributions dynamically generated through QCD evolution of the valence quark PDFs.</description>

      <title>Attractive features of Higgsino Dark Matter in the GNMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Higgsino dark matter(DM) scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the mixing of Gaugino and Higgsino influences the mass splitting between neutralinos predominantly composed of Higgsino and introduces coupling between the DM and Higgs bosons. These effects modify the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, causing conflicts with the latest direct detection experiment results from LZ for both substantial and minute mixings. Consequently, the experimental measurement of DM relic density necessitates the Higgsino DM mass to be approximately 1.1 TeV. We discovered that in the Higgsino DM scenario of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model(NMSSM), the mixing of Singlino and Higgsino introduces analogous effects, with a crucial distinction being that the current LZ experiment permits significant mixing between Singlino and Higgsino. This pronounced mixing effect effectively attenuates the interactions between Higgsino-dominated neutralinos and standard model particles, enabling DM masses exceeding roughly 700 GeV to achieve the correct relic abundance. Through analytical formulas and numerical results, we elucidated these characteristics. Our research reveals that in the NMSSM, when comprehensively examining the mixing effects of Higgsino, Gaugino, and Singlino, the properties of Higgsino DM become markedly more intricate compared to the MSSM predictions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to energy spectrum of hydrogen due to the full one-photon-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present expressions for the full effective potential corresponding to the one-photon exchange interaction within the framework of an effective Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics. The final effective potential is expressed in terms of eight scalar functions. When these eight scalar functions are expanded in terms of velocities order by order, we can return to the non-relativistic effective potential systematically organized by velocities. By retaining the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential, we estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. The comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using conventional bound-state perturbative theory is discussed. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extend these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and scenarios involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter in String Theory: Haloscopes and Helioscopes as Probes of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments have the capacity to detect the QCD axion in the next decade, and precisely measure its mass, if it composes the majority of the dark matter. In type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the geometric regime, the QCD axion mass, $m_a$, is strongly correlated with the topological Hodge number $h^{1,1}$. We compute $m_a$ in a scan of $185{,}965$ compactifications of type IIB string theory on toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds. We compute the range of $h^{1,1}$ probed by different experiments under the condition that the QCD axion can provide the observed dark matter density with minimal fine-tuning. Taking the experiments DMRadio, ADMX, MADMAX, and BREAD as indicative on different mass ranges, the $h^{1,1}$ distributions peak near $h^{1,1}=24.9, \ 65.4, \ 196.8,$ and $310.9,$ respectively. We furthermore conclude that, without severe fine tuning, detection of the QCD axion as dark matter \emph{at any mass} disfavours 80% of models with $h^{1,1} =491$, which is thought to have the most known Calabi-Yau threefolds. Measurement of the solar axion mass with IAXO is the dominant probe of all models with $h^{1,1}\gtrsim 250$. This study demonstrates the immense importance of axion detection in experimentally constraining the string landscape.</description>

      <title>A study of bound states of $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}$, $B^{0}$, $\bar{B^{0}}$, $\bar{K^{0}}$ and $\phi$ mesons with light and heavy nuclei within chiral SU(3) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the possibilities of the formation of bound states of neutral pseudoscalar mesons $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ and the vector meson $\phi$, with the nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, calculating their binding energy and absorption decay width. To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we shall use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ and the scalar-isovector field $\delta$. The scalar-isovector field $\delta$ account for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some of possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral SU(3) model, the mesons $ \eta, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ are observed to have significant negative mass shift upto nuclear saturation density which lead to the possibility of the bound states at least for ground states and some of excited states in case of heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet $\eta^{'}$ and the vector meson $\phi$ the mass shift obtained are found to be small and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with different studies available in the field and will be useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study higher-derivative supersymmetric effective field theories focusing on the systematic procedure for the elimination of ghosts from the spectrum. Particular attention is paid to the auxiliary fields, for which the higher-derivative terms induce non-algebraic equations of motion. By employing field redefinitions or the reduction of order procedure (both in component and superfield language) we show that the auxiliary fields remain non-dynamical in the EFT and that on shell they give rise to both derivative and non-derivative corrections to the scalar action. These methods are applied to the search for a SUSY embedding of the DBI action and to the dimensional reduction of HD terms for the K\"ahler moduli in type IIB string compactifications.</description>

      <title>From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the primordial black hole reheating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas, especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any early matter-dominated universe scenario.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

Abstract: We study the longitudinal spin polarization of a relativistic fluid of massive spin-1/2 particles undergoing a boost-invariant expansion in the longitudinal direction and rotating in the transverse plane. We express the polarization vector in terms of spin moments and derive closed equations of motion for the latter using spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation. These equations of motion are valid at any time of the evolution, from the free-streaming regime to the hydrodynamic regime. At late time, the polarization features contributions from gradients of the fluid velocity and of the temperature, that emerge from the nonlocal part of the collision term. Our results can be used to explore polarization phenomena in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE Collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD Collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered. Predictions for the tidal deformability of neutron stars with hyperons are found to be in agreement with the observational constraints from the gravitational wave event GW170817 in the mass range $1.1-1.3$ $M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

Abstract: Quarkonia, the bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, are important tools for studying the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this study, we examine the behavior of in-medium quarkonium bound states in the QGP by analyzing their spectral functions at two temperatures, $T = 220\,\textrm{MeV}$ and $T = 293\,\textrm{MeV}$. We use physics-motivated information to reconstruct the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator. Near the threshold, the spectral function is estimated through a complex potential, determined non-perturbatively from Wilson line correlators. Our results show that the real part of the potential undergoes color screening above $T_{pc}$, while the imaginary part grows rapidly with increasing distance and temperature. For the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectral function, we use the perturbative vacuum spectral function, as the temperature effects are suppressed in this region. In the absence of a transport peak in the pseudoscalar channel, we find that this combination effectively describes the pseudoscalar correlator on the lattice, calculated using relativistic quark fields. Our results show that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) experiences significant thermal effects, as indicated by the broadening of the $\eta_c(1S)$ state. In contrast, the $\eta_b(1S)$ state remains intact, with a sharp bound state peak.</description>

Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission and absorption in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, in which photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction-picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. First, we examine this effect in a thermal bath in a Minkowski background and find that emission or absorption occurs depending on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of ${O}(0.1)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at frequencies of ${O}(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a possible mechanism for amplifying gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it highlights potential advancements in gravitational wave detection. The significant effect observed in a flat background implies a backreaction of the thermal bath on spacetime. Thus, understanding this effect in an expanding universe is essential. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, gravitons within the horizon at reheating undergo stimulated absorption. We find a secular logarithmic growth for the superhorizon mode, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis, which requires further investigation in future.</description>

      <title>Potential search for direct slepton pair production in $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV at CEPC</title>

Abstract: The center-of-mass energy of Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) could be upgrade to 360 GeV level (CEPC@360GeV) after its ten-year running at 240 GeV. Besides SM precision measurements, CEPC@360GeV also has good potential for BSM physics searches, which is a good complementary for hadron colliders. This paper presents the sensitivity study of direct stau and smuon pair production at CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV by full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. With 1.0 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity and the assumption of flat 5% systematic uncertainty, the CEPC@360 GeV has the potential to discover the production of combined left-handed and right-handed stau up to 170 GeV if exists, or up to 169 ( 162 ) GeV for the production of pure left-handed (right-handed) stau; the discovery potential of direct smuon reaches up to 178 GeV with the same assumption.</description>
