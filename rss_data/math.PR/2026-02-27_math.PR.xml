      <title>Sum of Gaussian vectors and large sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for some constant $\kappa&gt;0$, any centered $\kappa$-subgaussian random variable is equal to the sum of three standard Gaussian random variables, confirming a conjecture of M. Talagrand. We also prove that given $\Lambda\geq 1$, any centered random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|X\|\leq \Lambda$ almost surely and $\|\mathrm{Cov}(X)\|\leq {\Lambda^2 }{e^{-\Lambda^2}}$ is equal to the sum of a universal number of standard Gaussian random vectors. In particular, a centered random vector is subgaussian if and only if it is a finite sum of Gaussian random vectors. We apply these results to settle the permutation invariant case of M. Talagrand's convexity problem, and to give optimal estimates on the largest ellipsoid contained in a sum of large sets in Gaussian spaces.</description>

      <title>IDS for subordinate Brownian motions in Poisson random environment on nested fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Lifshitz singularity of the integrated density of states (IDS) for random Schr\"odinger operators \[ H^{\omega} = \phi(-\mathcal{L}) + V^{\omega} \] on planar unbounded nested fractals with the Good Labeling Property. Here, $\mathcal{L}$ is the Laplacian on the fractal, $\phi$ is an operator monotone function with mild regularity, and $V^{\omega}$ is a Poissonian random potential with a sufficiently regular profile. The main novelty of our work lies in showing that the study of $V^{\omega}$ can be effectively reduced to the analysis of certain alloy-type potential, where the sites are no longer lattice points as in the classical $\mathbb{Z}^d$ case, but fractal complexes. This observation enables us to apply an approach, new in the setting of Poissonian random fields, which allows us to treat a broad class of Bernstein functions $\phi$. In particular, it covers the case $\phi(\lambda)=(\lambda+m^{d_w/\vartheta})^{\vartheta/d_w}-m$, $\vartheta \in (0,d_w)$, $m&gt;0$, corresponding to relativistic models, which were previously unattainable on fractals by known methods.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the weakly coupled 4D Anderson Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak coupling limit of the Anderson Hamiltonian in the critical dimension $d=4$. In a perturbative sense, we prove Gaussian fluctuations about the Green's function of the Laplacian. The fluctuations are described by an explicit effective variance, up to a critical value of the coupling constant at which we expect a phase transition in the structure of the fluctuations. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis of Feynman diagrams, and on a detailed study of the BPHZ renormalisation of the model. We characterise the limiting distribution in terms of primitive blow-ups, and prove that no Laplacian renormalisation is present. Our approach seems applicable to a broad class of equations.</description>

      <title>Mean-field games with rough common noise: the compactification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field game (MFG) problems with rough common noise where the representative state dynamics is governed by a controlled rough stochastic differential equation driven by an idiosyncratic Brownian motion and a deterministic rough path noise affecting the whole population. Within this new framework, we introduce a canonical weak formulation based on relaxed controls and rough martingale problems. We prove the existence of a pathwise mean-field equilibrium in this context by developing new technical tools for compactification to accommodate rough integration, which deviate substantially from classical compactification arguments in the literature. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the pathwise problem and the classical MFG problem with randomized Brownian common noise: conditioning yields the pathwise problem almost surely; and conversely, under a suitable causality/measurable-selection requirement, pathwise mean-field equilibria can be aggregated to produce randomized mean-field equilibria in the classical problem.</description>

      <title>Branching random walks with ageing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching processes are models used to describe populations that reproduce and die over time. In the classical setting, an individual's reproductive capacity remains constant throughout its lifetime. However, in real-world situations, reproductive capacity typically undergoes ageing - that is, after reaching a peak, it decreases over time. In this work, we study the influence of ageing on the behaviour of the process and how modifying its parameters, along with reproduction rates, affects the destiny of the process.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian point processes for coalescing particles via checkerboard duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalescing particles on a line merge when they meet. When every site is initially occupied, only finitely many particles survive at any positive time, and their positions form a Pfaffian point process: all correlation functions are determined by pairwise quantities arranged in antisymmetric matrices. Previous proofs of this structure relied on analytic methods specific to time-homogeneous dynamics. We identify the checkerboard duality as the structural reason for the Pfaffian: on a discrete planar graph, binary random choices create two complementary non-crossing forests, one tracing ancestral lineages backward and the other carrying the coalescing particles forward as domain boundaries. This duality converts the absence of particles in an interval into coalescence of ancestral lineages at its endpoints. A cancellative labeling then converts coalescence into annihilation, for which a companion paper provides a Pfaffian formula. The resulting empty-interval formula holds for any discrete graph with the checkerboard structure and arbitrary inhomogeneous edge probabilities, requiring no symmetry or specific distributions. This covers settings beyond existing methods, including totally asymmetric dynamics and position-dependent transition rules, and yields an explicit Pfaffian point process in each setting. For Brownian motion, the formula recovers the known Pfaffian point process and the empty-interval probabilities previously derived by PDE methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian chains with long-range dependence and their scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well-established theory linking certain semi-Markov chains and continuous-time random walks to time-fractional equations and anomalous diffusion. In this work, we go beyond the semi-Markov framework by considering some non-Markovian chains, which exhibit long-memory behaviour, due to stochastic dependence among their waiting times. Particular attention is devoted to the so-called para-Markov chains. Their waiting times share the same marginal distributions as those of the above mentioned semi-Markov chains, but they are dependent; their joint distribution is of Schur-constant type and is closely related to complete Bernstein functions and De Finetti's theorems. A second model that we focus on is given by time-changed Markov chains, where the random time is the inverse of an increasing stable process. This generalizes well-known semi-Markov models available in the literature, which typically focus solely on the inverse of the Levy stable subordinator. The above mentioned models are unified by a general theory of time change of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of randomly weighted sums without moment conditions of random weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, under a suitable condition, we study the asymptotics of randomly weighted sums and randomly weighted stopped sums with upper tail asymptotically independent increments, where no moment condition is made on random weights, and we provide an example to show the suitable condition is necessary in some sense. To this end, we firstly consider the uniform asymptotics of the corresponding weighted sums with a large convergence range than the existing results. Then, using the above results, we obtain an asymptotic estimation of the finite-time and random-time ruin probabilities in a discrete-time risk model. In the case of regular variation increments, a more explicit estimation is given by an extended Breiman's theorem. Finally, through some examples we illustrate that the conditions of the above results are relaxed and clear, and that there exist random variables are upper tail asymptotically independent rather than tail asymptotically independent.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Lacunary/Hereditary Laws of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Komlos asserts that L1-boundedness is sufficient for a given sequence of functions to contain a subsequence along which (in a "lacunary" manner), and along whose every further subsequence ("hereditarily"), a strong law of large numbers holds. We identify here slightly weaker, Egorov-type conditions, as not only sufficient in this context, but necessary as well. Necessary and sufficient conditions are developed also for the lacunary/hereditary version of the weak law of large numbers for general sequences, as well as for the weak law of large numbers in the context of exchangeable sequences, both long-open questions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for hyperbolic Anderson model with L\'evy colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the spatial integral $F_R(t)$ of the solution to the hyperbolic Anderson model in dimension $d=1$, driven by the L\'evy colored noise introduced in Balan and Jim\'enez (2026). We assume that the spatial coloration kernel of the noise is either integrable on $\mathbb{R}$, or is the Riesz kernel of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$, and the L\'evy measure of the noise has finite moments of order $p$ and $2p$ for some $p \in (1,2]$. By applying a recent result of Trauthwein (2025), we prove that $F_R(t)/\sqrt{{\rm Var}\big(F_R(t)\big)}$ converges to the standard normal distribution as $R \to \infty$, and we give an estimate for the rate of this convergence in the Fortet-Mourier distance, the 1-Wasserstein distance, or the Kolmogorov distance. We also provide the corresponding functional limit result.</description>

      <title>Interface for variants of the contact process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two one-dimensional variants of the contact process: the contact-and-barrier process, where the population evolves in a region delimited by a randomly moving barrier, and the multitype contact process, in which two species compete for space. The contact-and-barrier process is started with the barrier at the origin and all sites to its right occupied, while the multitype contact process is started from the Heaviside configuration with species 1 to the left of the origin and species 2 to the right. We prove that both models exhibit tight interfaces and that, after centring by an appropriate deterministic speed, the interface position satisfies a central limit theorem. Our analysis relies on a renewal-time method based on a novel construction called patchwork construction, in which the processes are built by concatenating space-time evolutions over successive time intervals of random length, providing a more convenient framework for defining the renewal times that drive the proofs.</description>

      <title>Spin Glass Concepts in Computer Science, Statistics, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glass theory studies the structure of sublevel sets and minima (or near-minima) of certain classes of random functions in high dimension. Near-minima of random functions also play an important role in high-dimensional statistics and statistical learning, where minimizing the empirical risk (which is a random function of the model parameters) is the method of choice for learning a statistical model from noisy data. Finally, near-minima of random functions are obviously central to average-case analysis of optimization algorithms. Computer science, statistics, and machine learning naturally lead to questions that are traditionally not addressed within physics and mathematical physics. I will try to explain how ideas from spin glass theory have seeded recent developments in these fields.

      <title>Support Tokens, Stability Margins, and a New Foundation for Robust LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.</description>

      <title>Queue occupancy and server size distribution of a queue length dependent vacation queue with an optional service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete time queueing system is highly applicable to modern telecommunication systems, where it provides adaptive packet handling, congestion controlled security/inspection, energy efficient operation, and supports bursty traffic common in 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing environments. In this article, we analyze an infinite-buffer discrete-time batch-arrival queue with single and multiple vacation policy where customers are served in batches, in two phases, namely first essential service (FES) and second optional service (SOS). In such systems, the FES corresponds to basic data processing or packet routing, while SOS represents secondary tasks such as encryption, error checking, data compression, or deep packet inspection that may not be necessary for every packet. Here, we derive the bivariate probability generating functions for the joint distribution of the number of packets waiting for transmission and the number are being processed immediately after the completion of both the FES and SOS. Furthermore, the complete joint distribution at arbitrary time slots, including vacation completion states, is established. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, including an example with discrete phase type service time distribution. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters on marginal system's probabilities and different performance measures have been investigated through several graphical representations.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Constrained Gibbs Measures: with Applications to High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a non-standard problem of generating samples from a low-temperature Gibbs distribution with \emph{constrained} support, when some of the coordinates of the mode lie on the boundary. These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics. Key examples of low-temperature Gibbs distributions include Bayesian posteriors, and we demonstrate our results on three canonical examples: a high-dimensional logistic regression model, a Poisson linear model, and a Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Noise: A Better Predator-Prey Modeling Framework with Cross-Covariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of stochasticity into continuous ecological models frequently relies on phenomenological, diagonal diffusion terms that lack a rigorous microscopic basis. We demonstrate that this standard practice fundamentally misrepresents the geometry of demographic fluctuations. By deriving a stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur model directly from an integer-valued, Bernoulli-coupled continuous-time Markov chain, we isolate the exact diffusion covariance structure dictated by event stoichiometry. We mathematically prove that coupled predation--conversion events inherently generate a structurally negative predator--prey cross-covariance, exposing the severe mathematical and biological limitations of standard diagonal-noise approximations. Furthermore, we resolve a persistent ambiguity in stochastic population modeling by explicitly formalizing the bifurcation between open-domain formulations (for survival-conditioned interior dynamics) and absorbed formulations (for extinction-permitting dynamics). To rigorously support this distinction, we develop a tailored two-stage Lyapunov well-posedness architecture that separates non-explosion criteria from boundary-barrier positivity invariance. By bridging microscopic event stoichiometry with macroscopic boundary-degenerate diffusions, this work replaces ad hoc noise constructs with a definitive, mathematically exact template for covariance-consistent and boundary-aware ecological modeling.</description>

      <title>Anchoring and Mixed-Norm Contractions in Averaging-Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single informed agent can draw an arbitrarily large network to the ground truth. This is the sharpest consequence of the "Averaging plus Learning" framework studied here, where agents update opinions by socially averaging neighbours while some receive private feedback at heterogeneous rates. The key is a graph-theoretic property we call condensely anchored, which implies convergence to the correct consensus on fixed networks. In the original framework of Popescu and Vaidya (2023), every agent was required to learn. Removing that requirement changes the problem fundamentally: the underlying graph must now carry the signal from a handful of anchors to everyone else. When learning rates decay to zero, a persistence condition on the rates alone suffices, with no uniform connectivity or aperiodicity assumed. The hardest case is intermittent connectivity, where no single time step contracts in any standard norm. A mixed-operator-norm framework is developed that extracts two-step contraction from the interplay between aggregate learning mass and entrywise diffusion of influence, a mechanism new to consensus literature. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness: vanishing noise preserves convergence to the ground truth, whereas persistent noise drives the system to a limiting law.</description>

      <title>Generalized fluctuation bounds for stochastic algorithms in the presence of compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a convergence result for sequences of random variables taking values in a metric space that satisfy a stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity condition, in the context of a (local) compactness assumption. Our result is quantitative in that we derive an explicit and effective construction which, in terms of only a few moduli representing quantitative witnesses to key properties of the sequence of random variables and the underlying metric space involved, provides a metastable rate of pointwise convergence, a type of generalized fluctuation bound. That quantitative result in particular relies on the development of a finitary theory of martingales, culminating in a fully finitary Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We outline how this result particularises to the circumstances of the seminal work of Combettes and Pesquet on stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, and we provide an initial application by illustrating how these results can be used to provide a metastable rate of pointwise convergence for a stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann scheme solving a stochastic common fixed point problem for nonexpansive maps over proper Hadamard spaces. This work is set in the context of recent applications of the logic-based methodology of proof mining to probability theory, and represents its most sophisticated case study to date.</description>

      <title>Are sparse graphs typically determined by their spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether it is typical for a sparse graph to be uniquely characterized by its adjacency spectrum up to isomorphism. Our first result shows that the giant component of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph is cospectral when the average degree is sufficiently small. The proof relies on the existence of a specific pendant tree, combined with a method by Schwenk that swaps trees to construct a cospectral mate.
  It seems possible that pendant trees are essentially the only obstruction, meaning that the giant should become characterized by spectrum with high probability if one prunes these by considering the 2-core. The majority of the paper is devoted to theoretical and numerical evidence supporting this concept. Our main theorem in this direction establishes that local switching methods can not cause the 2-core to be cospectral. We also discuss R-cospectrality and rational cospectrality at fixed level.</description>

      <title>Remarks on stationary GARCH processes under heavy tail distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X_n)_{n\in \mathbb Z}$ be a GARCH process with $E(X_0^4)&lt;\infty$, and let $\mu_n$ denote the distribution of $\frac 1{{\sqrt n}}\sum_{i=1}^n [X_i^2-\mathbb E(X_0^2)]$. We derive a numerical approximation of $\mu_n$ when $x_1,...,x_n$ are observed. This yields the derivation of confidence intervals for $\mu= E(X_0^2)$ and we investigate the accuracy of these confidence intervals in comparison with standard ones based on normal approximation. Moreover, when the innovation process has heavy tail distribution, we improve the method using a new resampling method.</description>

      <title>Low-degree Lower bounds for clustering in moderate dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of clustering $n$ points into $K$ groups drawn from a mixture of isotropic Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $\Delta$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $\Delta$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a "non-parametric rate". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Laplace asymptotics up to the concentration threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional Laplace-type integrals of the form $I(\lambda):=\int_{\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-\lambda f(x)}dx$ in the regime where $d$ and $\lambda$ are both large. Until now, rigorous bounds for Laplace expansions in growing dimension have been restricted to the "Gaussian-approximation" regime, known to hold when $d^2/\lambda\to0$. This excludes many practically relevant regimes, including those arising in physics and modern high-dimensional statistics, which operate beyond this threshold while still satisfying the concentration condition $d/\lambda\to0$. Here, we close this gap. We develop an explicit asymptotic expansion for $\log I(\lambda)$ with quantitative remainder bounds that remain valid throughout this intermediate region, arbitrarily close to the concentration threshold $d/\lambda\to0$.
  Fix any $L\ge1$ and suppose $g(0)=1$. Assume that, in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$, the operator norms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are bounded independently of $d$ and $\lambda$ through orders $2(L+1)$ and $2L$, respectively. Assuming also some mild global growth conditions on $f$ and $g$, we prove that $$ \log I(\lambda)=\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} b_k(f,g)\lambda^{-k}+O(d^{L+1}/\lambda^L),\quad d^{L+1}/\lambda^L\to0, $$ and that the coefficients satisfy $b_k(f,g)= O(d^{k+1})$. Moreover, the coefficients $b_k(f,g)$ coincide with those arising from the formal cumulant-based expansion of $\log I(\lambda)$.
  The proof is constructive and proceeds via explicit polynomial changes of variables that iteratively "quadratize" the exponent while controlling Jacobian effects, thereby avoiding heavy Gaussian concentration machinery. We illustrate the expansion on two representative examples.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic fluctuation theory of particle systems driven by Poisson noise: study of the $q$-TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a moment formula for generalized fractional polynomial processes, i.e., for polynomial-preserving Markov processes time-changed by an inverse L\'evy-subordinator. If the time change is inverse $\alpha$-stable, the time-derivative of the Kolmogorov backward equation is replaced by a Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha$, and we demonstrate that moments of such processes are computable, in a closed form, using matrix Mittag-Leffler functions. The same holds true for cross-moments in equilibrium, generalizing results of Leonenko, Meerschaert and Sikorskii from the one-dimensional diffusive case of second-order moments to the multivariate, jump-diffusive case of moments of arbitrary order. We show that also in this more general setting, fractional polynomial processes exhibit long-range dependence, with correlations decaying as a power law with exponent $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On convex order and supermodular order without finite mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many results on the convex order in the literature were stated for random variables with finite mean. For instance, a fundamental result in dependence modeling is that the sum of a pair of random random variables is upper bounded in convex order by that of its comonotonic version and lower bounded by that of its counter-monotonic version, and all existing proofs of this result require the random variables' expectations to be finite. We show that the above result remains true even when discarding the finite-mean assumption, and obtain several other results on the comparison of infinite-mean random variables via the convex order. To our surprise, we find two deceivingly similar definitions of the convex order, both of which exist widely in the literature, and they are not equivalent for random variables with infinite mean. This subtle discrepancy in definitions also applies to the supermodular order, and it gives rise to some incorrect statements, often found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Zero-Waiting Load Balancing with Heterogeneous Servers in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the steady-state delay performance of load balancing in large-scale systems with heterogeneous servers in the heavy-traffic regimes. The system consists of $N$ servers, each with a local buffer of size $b-1$, serving jobs in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda N$, where $\lambda = 1 - N^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed with fully heterogeneous rates, where the service rate of each server can differ and may scale with the system size $N$. We study a queue length aware and service rate aware load balancing policy, Join-the-Fastest-Shortest-Queue (JFSQ), and demonstrate that it achieves asymptotic zero waiting time and probability under the heavy traffic regimes, including both the Sub-Halfin-Whitt ($\alpha \in (0,0.5)$) and Super-Halfin-Whitt ($\alpha \in [0.5,1)$) regimes. The performance bounds of waiting time and probability explicitly capture the convergence rate w.r.t. the system size $N$ and show the negative effect of server heterogeneity. Our analysis builds on the general framework of Stein's method with iterative state-space peeling, where we design a sequence of Lyapunov functions to analyze the high-dimensional heterogeneous system without assuming exchangeability and monotonicity. Our analysis shows that JFSQ efficiently utilizes servers with higher capacities, and the steady-state system can be coupled with a single-server queue via Stein's method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish delay performance bounds of a load-balancing system with size $N$ and fully heterogeneous servers in heavy traffic.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of $N$ interacting particles described by the classical and relativistic Langevin dynamics with singular forces and multiplicative noises. For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity and High-Dimensional Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose \textit{DeepMartingale}, a deep-learning framework for the dual formulation of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems under continuous-time models. Leveraging a martingale representation, our method implements a \emph{pure-dual} procedure that directly optimizes over a parameterized class of martingales, producing computable and tight \emph{dual upper bounds} for the value function in high-dimensional settings without requiring any primal information or Snell-envelope approximation. We prove convergence of the resulting upper bounds under mild assumptions for both first- and second-moment losses. A key contribution is an expressivity theorem showing that \textit{DeepMartingale} can approximate the true value function to any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ using neural networks of size at most $\tilde{c} d^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, with constants independent of the dimension $d$ and accuracy $\varepsilon$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Since expressivity in this setting translates into scalability, our theory also motivates estimating the dimension scaling law to guide architecture design and the training setup in deep learning-based numerical computation and the choice of rebalancing frequency for the related hedging strategy. The learned martingale representation further yields a practical and dimension-scalable \emph{deep delta hedging strategy}. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional Bermudan option benchmarks confirm convergence, expressivity, scalable training, and the stability of the resulting upper bounds and hedging performance.</description>

      <title>Extreme-Path Benchmarks for Sequential Probability Forecasts</title>

Abstract: Real-time probability forecasts for binary outcomes are routine in sports, online experimentation, medicine, and finance. Retrospective narratives, however, often hinge on pathwise extremes: for example, a forecast that becomes "90% certain" for an event that ultimately does not occur. Standard pointwise calibration tools do not quantify how frequently such extremes should arise under correct sequential calibration, where the ideal forecast sequence is a bounded martingale that ends at the realized outcome. We derive benchmark distributions for extreme-path functionals conditional on the terminal outcome, emphasizing the peak-on-loss: the largest forecast value attained along realizations that end in failure. In continuous time with continuous paths we obtain an exact closed-form benchmark; in discrete time we prove sharp finite-sample bounds together with an explicit correction decomposition that isolates terminal-step crossings and overshoots. These results yield model-agnostic null targets and one-sided tail probabilities for diagnosing sequential miscalibration from extreme-path behavior. We also develop competitive extensions tailored to win-probability feeds and illustrate the approach using ESPN win-probability series for NFL and NBA regular-season games (2018-2024), finding broad agreement with the benchmark in the NFL and systematic departures in the NBA.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Random Network Distillation, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.</description>
