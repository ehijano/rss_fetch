      <title>StochasticGW-GPU: rapid quasi-particle energies for molecules beyond 10000 atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.</description>

      <title>Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</description>

      <title>Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Framework for Neural Network Quantum States in Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NQS) in discrete Fock spaces is limited by sampling variance and slow mixing. We present a deterministic framework that optimizes a neural backflow ansatz within dynamically adaptive configuration subspaces, corrected by second-order perturbation theory. This approach eliminates Monte Carlo noise and, through a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, exhibits sub-linear scaling with respect to subspace size. Benchmarks on bond dissociation in H2O and N2, and the strongly correlated chromium dimer Cr2, validate the method's accuracy and stability in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Fewest-Switches Surface Hopping with Combined Deep Learning Potential and Long Short-Term Memory Network Propagator for Simulating Realistic Photochemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) is the most popular method for simulating photochemical processes of molecular systems. Recently, we have constructed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks as a propagator for electronic subsystems in FSSH dynamics simulations. The collective results on Tully's three models have been reproduced satisfactorily. In the present work, we develop an extended LSTM-FSSH framework to simulate realistic photochemical reactions. The input features of LSTM as well as the training procedure are redesigned to represent high-dimensional nuclear degrees of freedom in an effective way. Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference. Only 10 reference trajectories are required for training LSTM networks, and then a trajectory ensemble can be generated with very efficient LSTM-FSSH dynamics simulations to obtain collective results.</description>

      <title>Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.</description>

      <title>Excited-State Intermolecular Proton Transfer and Competing Pathways in 3-Hydroxychromone: A Non-adiabatic Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) is a fundamental photochemical process in which photoexcitation induces proton transfer within a molecule, leading to the formation of a tautomeric excited state. It was observed experimentally that the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system exhibits two distinct proton-transfer time scales upon excitation to the lowest "bright" singlet excited state: an ultrafast component on the femtosecond time scale and a slower one on the picosecond time scale, largely insensitive to solvent effects. Up to now, the microscopic origin of the second time constant has only been hypothesised. Here, using mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we explicitly observe the two ESIPT time constants and we rationalise the origin of the second time scale by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. Comprehensive analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories enables us to construct an explicit reaction network for 3-HC, delineating the interplay between canonical ESIPT and torsion-mediated pathways. This unified mechanistic framework reconciles the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Molecular structure, binding, and disorder in TDBC-Ag plexcitonic assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Nanopore Wall Geometry on Electrical Double-Layer Charging Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement strongly influences electrochemical systems, where structural control has enabled advances in nanofluidics, sensing, and energy storage. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models. This work establishes a scalable approach to link pore geometry with double-layer dynamics and offers new design principles for optimizing supercapacitor performance.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inorganic Electrides Discovery by Generative Models and Hierarchical Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Torsion-Induced Transformation of Adenosine Monophosphate: Insights into Prebiotic Chemistry of RNA by Astronomical Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of life is yet a compelling scientific mystery that has sometimes been attributed to high-pressure impacts by small solar system bodies such as comets, meteoroids, asteroids, and transitional objects. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

      <title>The roles of bulk and surface thermodynamics in the selective adsorption of a confined azeotropic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid mixtures that exhibit an azeotrope cannot be purified by simple bulk distillation. Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a "train once, learn many" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits.</description>

      <title>Model density approach to Ewald summations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of the electrostatic potential is fundamental to the study of condensed phase systems. We discuss the calculation of the relevant lattice summations by Ewald-type techniques. A model charge density is introduced, that cancels multipole moments of the crystalline charge distribution up to a desired order, for accelerating convergence of the Ewald sums. The method is applicable to calculations of bulk systems, employing arbitrary unit cells in a classical or quantum context, and with arbitrary basis functions to represent the charge density. The approach clarifies a decades-old implementation in the CRYSTAL code.</description>

Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems</title>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>

Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory</title>

Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>
