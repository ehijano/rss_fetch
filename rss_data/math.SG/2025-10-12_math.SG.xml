      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adams operations in quasimap K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define quantum deformations of Adams operations in $K$-theory, in the framework of quasimap quantum $K$-theory. They provide $K$-theoretic analogs of the quantum Steenrod operations from equivariant symplectic Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the compatibility of these operations with the Kahler and equivariant $q$-difference module structures, provide sample computations via $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant localization, and identify them with $p$-curvature operators of the Kahler $q$-difference connections as studied in Koroteev-Smirnov. We also formulate and verify a $K$-theoretic quantum Hikita conjecture at roots of unity, and propose an indirect algebro-geometric definition of quantum Steenrod operations</description>

      <title>Duistermaat-Heckman measures for Hamiltonian groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a source proper, source connected regular symplectic groupoid acting locally freely and effectively in a Hamiltonian way, and assume that the moment map is proper and has connected fibres. In this case there is an associated Duistermaat-Heckman measure on the quotient orbifold. We show that this measure is polynomial with respect to the natural affine measure.</description>
