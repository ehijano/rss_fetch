      <title>Extended (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras as companion structures of extended Rota-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the common theme of splitting of operations, the notions of (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras have attracted sustained attention with broad applications. An important aspect of their studies is as the derived structures of Rota-Baxter operators on associative or Lie algebras. This paper introduces extended versions of (tri)dendriform algebras, pre-Lie algebras, and post-Lie algebras, establishing close relations among these new structures that generalize those among their classical counterparts. These new structures can be derived from the extended Rota-Baxter operator, which combines the standard Rota-Baxter operator and the modified Rota-Baxter operator. To characterize these new notions as the derived structures of extended Rota-Baxter algebras, we define the binary quadratic operad in companion with an operad with nontrivial unary operations. Then the extended (tri)dendriform algebra is shown to be the binary quadratic nonsymmetric operads in companion to the operad of extended Rota-Baxter algebras. As a key ingredient in achieving this and for its own right, the free extended Rota-Baxter algebra is constructed by bracketed words.</description>

      <title>Koszul Lie algebras and their subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines (restricted) Koszul Lie algebras, a class of positively graded Lie algebras with a quadratic presentation and specific cohomological properties. The study employs HNN-extensions as a key tool for decomposing and analysing these algebras.
  Building on a previous work on Koszul Lie algebras ("Kurosh theorem for certain Koszul Lie algebras", S. Blumer), this paper also deals with Bloch-Kato Lie algebras, which constitute a distinguished subclass of that of Koszul Lie algebras where all subalgebras generated by elements of degree $1$ have a quadratic presentation.
  It is shown that Bloch-Kato Lie algebras satisfy a version of the Levi decomposition theorem and that they satisfy the Toral Rank Conjecture. Two new families of such Lie algebras are introduced, including all graded Lie algebras generated in degree $1$ and defined by two quadratic relations.
  Throughout the paper, we show many properties of right-angled Artin graded (RAAG) Lie algebras, which form a large class of Koszul Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Extending Structures for Rota-Baxter family Hom-associative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first define extending datums and unified products of Rota-Baxter family Hom-associative algebras, and theoretically solve the extending structure problem. Moreover, we consider flag datums as an application, and give an example of the extending structure problem. Second, we introduce matched pairs of Rota-Baxter family Hom-associative algebras, and theoretically solve the factorization problem. Finally, we define deformation maps on a Rota-Baxter family Hom extending structure, and theoretically solve the classifying complements problem.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras associated with Gorenstein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic structure of indecomposable $\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras $V = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty} V_n$, emphasizing the intricate interactions between the commutative associative algebra $V_0$, the Leibniz algebra $V_1$ and how non-degenerate bilinear forms on $V_0$ influence their overall structure. We establish foundational properties for indecomposability and locality in $\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras, with our main result demonstrating the equivalence of locality, indecomposability, and specific structural conditions on semiconformal-vertex algebras. The study of symmetric invariant bilinear forms of semiconformal-vertex algebra is investigated. We also examine the structural characteristics of $V_0$ and $V_1$, demonstrating conditions under which certain $\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras cannot be quasi vertex operator algebras, semiconformal-vertex algebras, or vertex operator algebras, and explore $\mathbb{N}$-graded vertex algebras $V=\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}V_n$ associated with Gorenstein algebras. Our analysis includes examining the socle, Poincar\'{e} duality properties, and invariant bilinear forms of $V_0$ and their influence on $V_1$, providing conditions for embedding rank-one Heisenberg vertex operator algebras within $V$. Supporting examples and detailed theoretical insights further illustrate these algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of chromatic polynomials and graphical arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first observe a mysterious similarity between the braid arrangement and the arrangement of all hyperplanes in a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. These two arrangements are defined by the determinants of the Vandermonde and the Moore matrix, respectively. These two matrices are transformed to each other by replacing a natural number $n$ with $q^n$ ($q$-deformation).
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of ``$q$-deformation of graphical arrangements'' as certain subarrangements of the arrangement of all hyperplanes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This new class of arrangements extends the relationship between the Vandermonde and Moore matrices to graphical arrangements. We show that many invariants of the ``$q$-deformation'' behave as ``$q$-deformation'' of invariants of the graphical arrangements. Such invariants include the characteristic (chromatic) polynomial, the Stirling number of the second kind, freeness, exponents, basis of logarithmic vector fields, etc.</description>

      <title>(Co)module algebras and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the "official" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions.

      <title>The generalized inverses of tensors via the C-Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the issues about the generalized inverses of tensors under the C-Product. The aim of this paper is threefold. Firstly, this paper present the definition of the Moore-Penrose inverse, Drazin inverse of tensors under the C-Product. Moreover, the inverse along a tensor is also introduced. Secondly, this paper gives some other expressions of the generalized inverses of tensors by using several decomposition forms of tensors. Finally, the algorithms for the Moore-Penrose inverse, Drazin inverse of tensors and the inverse along a tensor are established.</description>
