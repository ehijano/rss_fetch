      <title>Glucagon and insulin production in pancreatic cells modeled using Petri nets and Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes is a civilization chronic disease characterized by a constant elevated concentration of glucose in the blood. Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.</description>

      <title>Topology, Kinetics and Inheritance in Clonal Colonies of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent skeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to produce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may severely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore, reaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on the factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy, we study the structure of N=28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony derived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh generation. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the replicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics are strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors linking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a lineage's topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible for the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an entropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random clustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find a clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of inactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.</description>
