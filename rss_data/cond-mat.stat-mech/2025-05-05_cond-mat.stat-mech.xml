      <title>The dynamical law behind eye movements: distinguishing between L\'evy and intermittent strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foraging is a complex spatio-temporal process which is often described with stochastic models. Two particular ones, L\'evy walks (LWs) and intermittent search (IS), became popular in this context. Researchers from the two communities, each advocating for either L\'evy or intermittent approach, independently analyzed foraging patterns and reported agreement between empirical data and the model they used. We resolve this L\'evy-intermittent dichotomy for eye-gaze trajectories collected in a series of experiments designed to stimulate free foraging for visual information. By combining analytical results, statistical quantifiers, and basic machine learning techniques, we devise a method to score the performance of the models when they are used to approximate an individual gaze trajectory. Our analysis indicates that the intermittent search model consistently yields higher scores and thus approximates the majority of the eye-gaze trajectories better.</description>

      <title>Family-Vicsek universality of the binary intrinsic dimension of nonequilibrium data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium. Yet, its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherences can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore, in addition to the single qubit coherence, how the quantum coupling between the two qubits affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}=\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TLS}\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm min}^{\rm TQS}\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR.</description>

      <title>Topological pump and its plateau transitions of $N$-leg spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological pump on an $N\textrm{-}$leg spin ladder is discussed by introducing spatial clusterization whose adiabatic limit is a set of $2N\textrm{-}$site staircase clusters. We set a pump path in the parameter space that connects two different symmetry protected topological phases. By introducing a symmetry breaking staggered magnetic field, the system is always gapped during the pump. In the topological pump {thus obtained}, the bulk Chern number is given by the number of the critical points enclosed by the pump path. Plateau transitions characterized by the Chern number are demonstrated associated with deformation of the pump path. We find that there are $N$ critical points enclosed by the pump path for the $N\textrm{-}$leg ladder. The ground state phase diagram without symmetry breaking terms is numerically investigated by using the quantized Berry phase. We also discuss the physical picture of edge states in the diagonal boundary, and numerically demonstrate the bulk-edge correspondence for $N=2,3$ cases.</description>

      <title>Power Laws Associated with Self-Organized Criticality: A Comparison of Empirical Data with Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Haldane-Hubbard model: Effective description of an open system with balanced gain and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the correlated Haldane-Hubbard model with single-particle gain and loss, focusing on its non-Hermitian phase diagram and the ensuing non-unitary dynamic properties. The interplay of interactions and non-hermiticity results in insulating behavior with a phase diagram divided into three distinct regions, exhibiting either topologically gapped or (real) gapless regimes and a trivial phase. The latter is mapped by the emergence of a local order parameter associated with a charge density wave. A ${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking at the low-lying spectrum occurs when increasing the gain-loss magnitude at a fixed interaction strength, marking the transition from gapped to gapless topological behavior. Further increase leads to the onset of charge ordering in a first-order phase transition in which level crossing takes place in the spectrum's imaginary part. The support that the staggered gain and loss display to robust charge density wave in equilibrium is confirmed in the real-time dynamics in the presence of non-hermiticity, suggesting that engineered gain and loss can be used to tailor an ordered many-body state in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-local Frustration-Free Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that frustration-free models, expressed as sums of finite-range interactions or hoppings, exhibit several properties markedly different from those of frustrated models. In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.</description>

      <title>Efficiently driving F$_1$ molecular motor in experiment by suppressing nonequilibrium variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F$_1$-ATPase (F$_1$) is central to cellular energy transduction. Forcibly rotated by another motor F$_\mathrm{o}$, F$_1$ catalyzes ATP synthesis by converting mechanical work into chemical free energy stored in the molecule ATP. The details of how F$_\mathrm{o}$ drives F$_1$ are not fully understood; however, evaluating efficient ways to rotate F$_1$ could provide fruitful insights into this driving since there is a selective pressure to improve efficiency. Here, we show that rotating F$_1$ with an angle clamp is significantly more efficient than a constant torque. Our experiments, combined with theory and simulation, indicate that the angle clamp significantly suppresses the nonequilibrium variation that contributes to the futile dissipation of input work.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Energy Transduction in Complex Networks with Multiple Resources: The Chemistry Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum non-thermodynamic phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery [1-3]: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the general robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy and localized wave packets, exhibiting a tendency to occur in "semiclassical" setups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze Gaussian processes using statistical mechanics. Although the input is originally multidimensional, we simplify our model by considering the input as one-dimensional for statistical mechanical analysis. Furthermore, we employ periodic boundary conditions as an additional modeling approach. By using periodic boundary conditions, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix. The diagonalized covariance matrix is then applied to Gaussian processes. This allows for a statistical mechanical analysis of Gaussian processes using the derived diagonalized matrix. We indicate that the analytical solutions obtained in this method closely match the results from simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Decoding active force fluctuations from spatial trajectories of active systems</title>

Abstract: Mesoscopic active systems exhibit various unique behaviours - absent in passive systems - due to the forces generated by the corresponding constituents by converting their available free energies. However, estimating these forces - which are also stochastic and remain intertwined with the thermal noise - is especially non-trivial. Here, we introduce a technique to extract such fluctuating active forces acting on a passive particle immersed in an active bath with high statistical accuracy by filtering out the related thermal noise. We first test the efficacy of our method under numerical scenarios with different types of activity, and then apply it to the experimental trajectories of a microscopic particle (optically) trapped inside an active bath consisting of motile \textit{E.Coli.} bacteria. We believe that our simple yet powerful approach, which appears agnostic to the nature of the active force, should enable accurate measurement of force dynamics in living matter and potentially allow direct but reliable estimation of key thermodynamic parameters such as heat, work, and entropy production.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701</link>

Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>
