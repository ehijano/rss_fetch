      <title>The nature of silicon PN junction impedance at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough understanding of the small-signal response of solar cells can reveal intrinsic device characteristics and pave the way for innovations. This study investigates the impedance of crystalline silicon PN junction devices using TCAD simulations, focusing on the impact of frequency, bias voltage, and the presence of a low-high (LH) junction. It is shown that the PN junction exhibits a fixed $RC$-loop behavior at low frequencies, but undergoes relaxation in both resistance $R_j$ and capacitance $C_j$ as frequency increases. Moreover, it is revealed that the addition of a LH junction impacts the impedance by altering $R_j$, $C_j$, and the series resistance $R_s$. Contrary to conventional modeling approaches, which often include an additional $RC$-loop to represent the LH junction, this study suggests that such a representation does not represent the underlying physics, particularly the frequency-dependent behavior of $R_j$ and $C_j$.</description>

      <title>Application of Quantum Graph Theory to Metamaterial Design: Negative Refraction of Acoustic Waveguide Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage quantum graph theory to quickly and accurately characterise acoustic metamaterials comprising networks of interconnected pipes. Anisotropic bond lengths are incorporated in the model that correspond to space-coiled acoustic structures to exhibit dispersion spectra reminiscent of hyperbolic metamaterials. We construct two metasurfaces with embedded graph structure and, motivated by the graph theory, infer and fine-tune their dispersive properties to engineer non-resonant negative refraction of acoustic surface waves at their interface. Agreement between the graph model, full wave simulations, and experiments bolsters quantum graph theory as a new paradigm for metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Discrete Euler-Bernoulli Beam Lattices with Beyond Nearest Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of elastic waves on discrete periodic Euler-Bernoulli mass-beam lattices is characterised by the competition between coupled translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom at the mass-beam junctions. We influence the dynamics of this system by coupling junctions with beyond-nearest-neighbour spatial connections, affording freedom over the locality of dispersion extrema in reciprocal space, facilitating the emergence of interesting dispersion relations. A generalised dispersion relation for an infinite monatomic mass-beam chain, with any integer order combination of non-local spatial connections, is presented. We demonstrate that competing power channels, between mass and rotational inertia, drive the position and existence of zero group velocity modes within the first Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Sound Wave Manipulation Based on Valley Acoustic Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological acoustics provides new opportunities for materials with unprecedented functions. In this work, we report a design of topological valley acoustic interferometers by Y-shaped valley sonic crystals. By tight-bounding calculation and experimental demonstration, we successfully tune the acoustic energy partition rate by configuring the channel. An analytical theory proposed to explain the transmission property matches well with experimental observations. An additional {\pi} Berry phase is verified to accumulate circling along the shape-independent topological valley acoustic interferometer, unique in the pseudospin half systems. Based on the spectral oscillation originating from the accumulated dynamic phase and {\pi} Berry phase, a simplified method to measure acoustic valley interface dispersion is explored, which overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fast Fourier transform method and improves the measuring efficiency by simply analyzing the peaks and dips of the measured transmission spectrum. Moreover, an effective approach to tuning its transmissions, as well as the spectral line shapes proposed and realized by the local geometry design of the interferometer, exhibits strong tunability under an unchanged physical mechanism. Our work opens an avenue to design future acoustic devices with the function of sound wave manipulation based on the physical mechanism of interference and Berry phase.</description>

      <title>Development of TiN/AlN-based superconducting qubit components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of superconducting qubit components from titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) layers to create Josephson junctions and superconducting resonators in an all-nitride architecture. Our methodology comprises a complete process flow for the fabrication of TiN/AlN/TiN junctions, characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometry and DC electrical measurements. We evaluated the sputtering rates of AlN under varied conditions, the critical temperatures of TiN thin films for different sputtering environments, and the internal quality factors of TiN resonators in the few-GHz regime, fabricated from these films. Overall, this offered insights into the material properties critical to qubit performance. Measurements of the dependence of the critical current of the TiN / AlN / TiN junctions yielded values ranging from 150 ${\mu}$A to 2 ${\mu}$A, for AlN barrier thicknesses up to ca. 5 nm, respectively. Our findings demonstrate advances in the fabrication of nitride-based superconducting qubit components, which may find applications in quantum computing technologies based on novel materials.</description>

      <title>Memory traces ruled by surface-biased REDOX reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas and moisture sensing devices leveraging the resistive switching effect in transition metal oxide memristors promise to revolutionize next-generation, nano-scaled, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable sensor solutions. These sensors encode readouts in resistance state changes based on gas concentration, yet their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics offer richer dynamics, capturing detailed information about REDOX reactions and surface kinetics. Traditional vertical devices fail to fully exploit this complexity. This study demonstrates planar resistive switching devices, moving beyond the Butler-Volmer model. A systematic investigation of the electrochemical processes in Na-doped ZnO with lateral planar contacts reveals intricate patterns resulting from REDOX reactions on the device surface. When combined with advanced algorithms for pattern recognition, allow the analysis of complex switching patterns, including crossings, loop directions, and resistance values, providing unprecedented insights for next-generation complex sensors.</description>

      <title>A Source-Independent Fault Detection Method for Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a source-independent method for detecting faults along Transmission Lines (TL) to reduce the protection issues arising from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). In the proposed method, high-frequency waves are sent from either end of a TL, and the amplitudes of the receiving waves at the other end are measured. Faults change the characteristics of TLs. Therefore, the amplitudes of the receiving waves differ when a fault occurs. Closed-form formulations are developed for describing the receiving waves before and during the faults. These formulations indicate that at least one of the receiving waves is reduced after fault inception. Therefore, faults can be detected by identifying a decrease in one of the receiving waves. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, EMTP-RV is utilized for performing simulations. Additionally, laboratory experiments are conducted for further evaluation of the proposed method. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect faults along TLs regardless of the sources supplying the grid.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation: in particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude by discussing the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Flexible Trilayer Cellulosic Paper Separators engineered with BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric fillers for High Energy Density Sodium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a full cell configuration having Na$_{3}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ as cathode and pre-sodiated hard carbon as an anode with Cellulosic Paper Separators and compare the electrochemical performance of these ceramic-impregnated polymer-coated cellulose paper separators with commercial glass fiber separator. Notably, the paper-based multilayer separators provide desirable characteristics such as excellent electrolyte wettability, thermal stability up to 200\degree C, and ionic conductivity, which are essential for the efficient operation of SIBs. The cellulose separator is coated by a layer of polyvinylidene fluoride polymer, followed by a second layer of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) polymer in which ferroelectric fillers BaTiO$_{3}$ are integrated, which interacts with the polymer hosts through Lewis acid-base interactions ion and improves the conduction mechanism for the Na$^{+}$ ions. The final lamination is performed by varying the SBR concentrations (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 w/v\%). The incorporated polymer matrices improve the flexibility, adhesion and dispersion of the nanoparticles and affinity of the electrolyte to the electrode. The morphology of the paper separators shows the uniform interconnected fibers with the porous structure. Interestingly, we find that the paper separator with 0.75 w/v\% content of SBR exhibit decreased interfacial resistance and improved electrochemical performance, having retention of 62\% and nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency up to 240 cycles, as compared to other concentrations. Moreover, we observe the energy density around 376 Wh kg$^{-1}$ (considering cathode weight), which found to be comparable to the commercially available glass fiber separator. Our results demonstrate the potential of these multilayer paper separators towards achieving sustainability and safety in energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of giant elastocaloric cooling at cryogenic temperatures in TmVO$_4$ via a strain load/unload technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic elastocaloric effect relates changes in the strain that a material experiences to resulting changes in its temperature. While elastocaloric materials have been utilized for cooling in room temperature applications, the use of such materials for cryogenic cooling remains relatively unexplored. Here, we use a strain load/unload technique at low temperatures, similar to those employed at room-temperature, to demonstrate a large cooling effect in TmVO$_4$. For strain changes of $1.8 \cdot 10^{-3}$, the inferred cooling reaches approximately 50% of the material's starting temperature at 5 K, justifying the moniker "giant". Beyond establishing the suitability of this class of material for cryogenic elastocaloric cooling, these measurements also provide additional insight to the entropy landscape in the material as a function of strain and temperature, including the behavior proximate to the quadrupolar phase transition.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical sensor network with fiber Bragg gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics offers a versatile platform for both fundamental physics and ultrasensitive sensing. Importantly, resonant enhancement in both optical and mechanical responses enables the highly sensitive optical detection of small forces, displacements, vibrations, and magnetic fields, enabling it a promising candidate of the next generation of ultrasensitive sensor networks. However, this is impeded by the fiber optic-incompatibility and intrinsic nature of existing optomechanical sensors. Here, we report the first demonstration of an optomechanical sensor network in terms of magnetic field detection, wherein multiple fiber-optic optomechanical sensors are connected into a standard single mode fiber. Building upon a commercially available fiber Bragg gratings, we realize a robust low-loss, low-noise, and polarization-insensitive coupling with light sources in a way compatible with fiber optics. This thus enables our optomechanical senor to fulfill the requirements for ultrasensitive sensor networks. Furthermore, in this sensor network we demonstrate the sensitivity of 8.73 pm/Gs for DC magnetic fields and 537 fT/Hz1/2 for AC magnetic fields in a magnetically unshielded environment with the ambient temperature and pressure, better than the reported values in previous optomechanical magnetometers. Our work sheds light on exploiting cavity optomechanics in the practical applications and ultrasensitive senor networks.</description>

      <title>Physical synchronization of soft self-oscillating limbs for fast and autonomous locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. Contrarily, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables tethered and untethered locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance and phototaxis, opening up avenues for robust and functional robots at all scales.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Multi-layer Metasurface Design: Hybrid Deep Learning Models for Beyond-RGB Reconfigurable Structural Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are key to the development of flat optics and nanophotonic devices, offering significant advantages in creating structural colors and high-quality factor cavities. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLMs) further amplify these benefits by enhancing light-matter interactions within individual nanopillars. However, the numerous design parameters involved make traditional simulation tools impractical and time-consuming for optimizing MLMs. This highlights the need for more efficient approaches to accelerate their design. In this work, we introduce NanoPhotoNet, an AI-driven design tool based on a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. NanoPhotoNet enhances the design and optimization of MLMs, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 98.3% and a speed improvement of 50,000x compared to conventional methods. The tool enables MLMs to produce structural colors beyond the standard RGB region, expanding the RGB gamut area by 163%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of tunable structural colors, extending the metasurface functionality to tunable color filters. These findings present a powerful method for applying NanoPhotoNet to MLMs, enabling strong light-matter interactions in applications such as tunable nanolasers and reconfigurable beam steering.</description>

      <title>Excitonic signatures of ferroelectric order in parallel-stacked MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity, prevalent in various parallel-stacked layered materials, allows switching of out-of-plane ferroelectric order by in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. Its resilience against doping potentially enables next-generation storage and logic devices. However, studies have been limited to indirect sensing or visualization of ferroelectricity. For transition metal dichalcogenides, there is little knowledge about the influence of ferroelectric order on their intrinsic valley and excitonic properties. Here, we report direct probing of ferroelectricity in few-layer 3R-MoS$_2$ using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Contrary to a simple electrostatic perception, layer-hybridized excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moment remain decoupled from ferroelectric ordering, while intralayer excitons with in-plane dipole orientation are sensitive to it. Ab initio calculations identify stacking-specific interlayer hybridization leading to this asymmetric response. Exploiting this sensitivity, we demonstrate optical readout and control of multi-state polarization with hysteretic switching in a field-effect device. Time-resolved Kerr ellipticity reveals a direct correspondence between spin-valley dynamics and stacking order.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Silicon Photonic MEMS Switch Based on Centrally-Clamped Stepped Bistable Mechanical Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the compact horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch features a 10s us-scale switching speed and a 10s fJ-scale simulated switching energy within a 100*100 um2 footprint, with &lt;=12 V driving voltages. This 2*2 switch can be used in a variety of topologies for large-scale photonic switches, and its nonvolatility can potentially support future photonic FPGA designs.</description>

      <title>Reflection Measurement of the Scattering Mean Free Path at the Onset of Multiple Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple scattering of waves presents challenges for imaging complex media but offers potential for their characterization. Its onset is actually governed by the scattering mean free path $\ell_s$ that provides crucial information on the medium micro-architecture. Here, we introduce a reflection matrix method designed to estimate this parameter from the time decay of the single scattering rate. Our method is first validated by an ultrasound experiment on a tissue-mimicking phantom before being applied in-vivo to a human liver. This study opens important perspectives for quantitative imaging of heterogeneous media with waves, whether it be for non-destructive testing, biomedical or geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Normal high velocity solid dust impacts on tiles of tokamak-relevant temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Runaway electron incidence on plasma facing components triggers explosive events that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Subsequent dust-wall high speed impacts constitute a mechanism of wall damage and dust destruction. Empirical damage laws that can be employed for erosion estimates are based on room-temperature impact experiments. We use light-gas gun shooting systems to accelerate solid tungsten dust to near-supersonic speeds towards bulk tungsten targets that are maintained at different temperatures. This concerns targets cooled down to $-100^{\circ}$C with liquid nitrogen and targets resistively heated up to $400^{\circ}$C. Post-mortem surface analysis reveals that the three erosion regimes (plastic deformation, bonding, partial disintegration) weakly depend on the target temperature within the investigated range. It is concluded that empirical damage laws based on room-temperature measurements can be safely employed for predictions.</description>
