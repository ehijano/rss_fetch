      <title>EEG-EMG FAConformer: Frequency Aware Conv-Transformer for the fusion of EEG and EMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor pattern recognition paradigms are the main forms of Brain-Computer Interfaces(BCI) aimed at motor function rehabilitation and are the most easily promoted applications. In recent years, many researchers have suggested encouraging patients to perform real motor control execution simultaneously in MI-based BCI rehabilitation training systems. Electromyography (EMG) signals are the most direct physiological signals that can assess the execution of movements. Multimodal signal fusion is practically significant for decoding motor patterns. Therefore, we introduce a multimodal motion pattern recognition algorithm for EEG and EMG signals: EEG-EMG FAConformer, a method with several attention modules correlated with temporal and frequency information for motor pattern recognition. We especially devise a frequency band attention module to encode EEG information accurately and efficiently. What's more, modules like Multi-Scale Fusion Module, Independent Channel-Specific Convolution Module(ICSCM), and Fuse Module which can effectively eliminate irrelevant information in EEG and EMG signals and fully exploit hidden dynamics are developed and show great effects. Extensive experiments show that EEG-EMG FAConformer surpasses existing methods on Jeong2020 dataset, showcasing outstanding performance, high robustness and impressive stability.</description>

      <title>Solving FDR-Controlled Sparse Regression Problems with Five Million Variables on a Laptop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, there is an urgent demand for scalable multivariate and high-dimensional false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling variable selection methods to ensure the repro-ducibility of discoveries. However, among existing methods, only the recently proposed Terminating-Random Experiments (T-Rex) selector scales to problems with millions of variables, as encountered in, e.g., genomics research. The T-Rex selector is a new learning framework based on early terminated random experiments with computer-generated dummy variables. In this work, we propose the Big T-Rex, a new implementation of T-Rex that drastically reduces its Random Access Memory (RAM) consumption to enable solving FDR-controlled sparse regression problems with millions of variables on a laptop. We incorporate advanced memory-mapping techniques to work with matrices that reside on solid-state drive and two new dummy generation strategies based on permutations of a reference matrix. Our nu-merical experiments demonstrate a drastic reduction in memory demand and computation time. We showcase that the Big T-Rex can efficiently solve FDR-controlled Lasso-type problems with five million variables on a laptop in thirty minutes. Our work empowers researchers without access to high-performance clusters to make reproducible discoveries in large-scale high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communication Systems Using ADMM: Enhancing Channel Estimation and Signal Recovery in 5G mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework to address the dual-blind deconvolution challenge within joint radar-communication (JRC) systems, leveraging the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to estimate unknown radar channels G (or communication channel H) and transmitted signals X under convex constraints. The approach iteratively refines G (or H) and X estimates alongside auxiliary and dual variables, employing proximal operators to manage potential non-smoothness in the constraint functions. This method stands out for its computational efficiency and adaptability to a wide array of signal processing and communication problems where blind deconvolution is pivotal. Performance analysis reveals a notable reduction in communication mismatch and demonstrates significant improvements in key system metrics such as the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), spectrum efficiency, and radar mutual information, particularly within the context of 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. These results underscore the proposed framework's potential to enhance the synergy between radar and communication functions, promoting more effective spectrum utilisation and environmental sensing capabilities in next-generation wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adaptive Resource Scheduling for Phased Array Radar: Enhancing Efficiency through Synthesis Priorities and Pulse Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the resource scheduling performance of phased array radar, we propose a dynamic adaptive resource scheduling algorithm based on synthesis priorities and pulse interleaving. This approach addresses the challenges of low efficiency, high loss ratios, and significant subjectivity in task assignment within phased array radar systems. We introduce a task synthesis priority design method that considers the working mode priority, deadlines, and time shift ratios. By implementing this method, we can increase the flexibility of task scheduling and improve the efficiency of radar processing tasks. Additionally, our proposed pulse interleaving method effectively utilizes the waiting periods between receiving and transmitting pulses to process other beams, thereby enhancing resource utilization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly reduces time deviation ratios and scheduling failure rates while improving scheduling yield and time utilization ratios.</description>

      <title>Detection of Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Events Using Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The gold standard for OSAHS diagnosis, polysomnography (PSG), faces challenges in popularization due to its high cost and complexity. Recently, radar has shown potential in detecting sleep apnea-hypopnea events (SAE) with the advantages of low cost and non-contact monitoring. However, existing studies, especially those using deep learning, employ segment-based classification approach for SAE detection, making the task of event quantity estimation difficult. Additionally, radar-based SAE detection is susceptible to interference from body movements and the environment. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) can offer valuable information about OSAHS, but it also has certain limitations and cannot be used alone for diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method using millimeter-wave radar and pulse oximeter to detect SAE, called ROSA. It fuses information from both sensors, and directly predicts the temporal localization of SAE. Experimental results demonstrate a high degree of consistency (ICC=0.9864) between AHI from ROSA and PSG. This study presents an effective method with low-load device for the diagnosis of OSAHS.</description>

      <title>Towards ubiquitous radio access using nanodiamond based quantum receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems demands innovative solutions to address challenges in the deployment of a large number of base stations and the detection of multi-band signals. Quantum technology, specifically nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds, offers promising potential for the development of compact, robust receivers capable of supporting multiple users. For the first time, we propose a multiple access scheme using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing NV centers as nano-antennas. The unique response of each FND to applied microwaves allows for distinguishable patterns of fluorescence intensities, enabling multi-user signal demodulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FNDs-implemented receiver by simultaneously transmitting two uncoded digitally modulated information bit streams from two separate transmitters, achieving a low bit error ratio. Moreover, our design supports tunable frequency band communication and reference-free signal decoupling, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, we implement a miniaturized device comprising all essential components, highlighting its practicality as a receiver serving multiple users simultaneously. This approach paves the way for the integration of quantum sensing technologies in future 6G wireless communication networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Automated Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Sleep Stage Classification in Children Using Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19276v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between the millimeter-wave radar-based device and polysomnography (PSG) in diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and classification of sleep stage in children. Methods: 281 children, aged 1 to 18 years, who underwent sleep monitoring between September and November 2023 at the Sleep Center of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, were recruited in the study. All enrolled children underwent sleep monitoring by PSG and the millimeter-wave radar-based device, QSA600, simultaneously. QSA600 recordings were automatically analyzed using a deep learning model meanwhile the PSG data was manually scored. Results: The Obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (OAHI) obtained from QSA600 and PSG demonstrates a high level of agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.96). Bland-Altman analysis indicates that the mean difference of OAHI between QSA600 and PSG is -0.10 events/h (95% CI: -11.15 to 10.96). The deep learning model evaluated through cross-validation showed good sensitivity (81.8%, 84.3% and 89.7%) and specificity (90.5%, 95.3% and 97.1%) values for diagnosing children with OAHI&gt;1, OAHI&gt;5 and OAHI&gt;10. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.923, 0.955 and 0.988, respectively. For sleep stage classification, the model achieved Kappa coefficients of 0.854, 0.781, and 0.734, with corresponding overall accuracies of 95.0%, 84.8%, and 79.7% for Wake-sleep classification, Wake-REM-Light-Deep classification, and Wake-REM-N1-N2 N3 classification, respectively. Conclusions: QSA600 has demonstrated high agreement with PSG in diagnosing OSA and performing sleep staging in children. The device is portable, low-load and suitable for follow up and long-term pediatric sleep assessment.</description>

      <title>Wireless Environment Information Sensing, Feature, Semantic, and Knowledge: Four Steps Towards 6G AI-Enabled Air Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air interface technology plays a crucial role in optimizing the communication quality for users. To address the challenges brought by the radio channel variations to air interface design, this article proposes a framework of wireless environment information-aided 6G AI-enabled air interface (WEI-6G AI$^{2}$), which actively acquires real-time environment details to facilitate channel fading prediction and communication technology optimization. Specifically, we first outline the role of WEI in supporting the 6G AI$^{2}$ in scenario adaptability, real-time inference, and proactive action. Then, WEI is delineated into four progressive steps: raw sensing data, features obtained by data dimensionality reduction, semantics tailored to tasks, and knowledge that quantifies the environmental impact on the channel. To validate the availability and compare the effect of different types of WEI, a path loss prediction use case is designed. The results demonstrate that leveraging environment knowledge requires only 2.2 ms of model inference time, which can effectively support real-time design for future 6G AI$^{2}$. Additionally, WEI can reduce the pilot overhead by 25\%. Finally, several open issues are pointed out, including multi-modal sensing data synchronization and information extraction method construction.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Movable Antenna Aided Wideband Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that can significantly improve communication performance via the continuous adjustment of the antenna positions. To unleash the potential of MAs in wideband communication systems, acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI), i.e., the channel frequency responses (CFRs) between any position pair within the transmit (Tx) region and the receive (Rx) region across all subcarriers, is a crucial issue. In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for wideband MA systems. To start with, we express the CFRs as a combination of the field-response vectors (FRVs), delay-response vector (DRV), and path-response tensor (PRT), which exhibit sparse characteristics and can be recovered by using a limited number of channel measurements at selected position pairs of Tx and Rx MAs over a few subcarriers. Specifically, we first formulate the recovery of the FRVs and DRV as a problem with multiple measurement vectors in compressed sensing (MMV-CS), which can be solved via a simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm. Next, we estimate the PRT using the least-square (LS) method. Moreover, we also devise an alternating refinement approach to further improve the accuracy of the estimated FRVs, DRV, and PRT. This is achieved by minimizing the discrepancy between the received pilots and those constructed by the estimated CSI, which can be efficiently carried out by using the gradient descent algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the SOMP-based channel estimation method and alternating refinement method can reconstruct the complete wideband CSI with high accuracy, where the alternating refinement method performs better despite a higher complexity.</description>

      <title>How connected cars could capture cloud dynamics -- first evidence from two simulation scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing share of fluctuating electricity from photovoltaics calls for accurate approaches to estimate cloud motion, the primary source for the varying power supply. While local sensor networks are prominent in targeting forecast horizons too short for image-based methods, they have minimal spatial coverage. This work presents the first step towards expanding those approaches to spatially scalable sensor networks: With the motivation of using automotive light sensors as a sensor network, two excerpts from a microscopic traffic simulation serve as simulative sensor networks. A fractal-based cloud shadow pattern passes the sensor network areas with defined velocities and directions, which shall be estimated using the cumulative mean absolute error method. The evaluation results indicate that the more extensive observation areas compensate for the dynamics in the sensor network when compared to a reference work with a static sensor grid. Furthermore, this work shows how the estimates deteriorate with lower vehicle penetration rates (PR) and longer building shadows due to a lower solar elevation angle. At a penetration rate of 40 %, the root mean square errors for both sensor networks are still below 5 m/s. In conclusion, the spatio-temporal characteristics of a vehicle network offer some potential for estimating cloud movements.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Beamspace Modulation in Near-Field MIMO: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principal distinction in transitioning from far-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to near-field MIMO configurations lies in the notable augmentation of spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). This increase is not static;rather, it dynamically fluctuates in response to user mobility. A critical challenge emerges in effectively leveraging this significantly enhanced and continuously evolving spatial DoF, particularly when constrained by a limited and energy-intensive array of radio frequency (RF) chains. This article presents an exhaustive review of the current methodologies for exploring spatial DoF in MIMO systems, with a particular emphasis on the near-field context. Central to this review is the exploration of beamspace modulation, a technique that ingeniously capitalizes on the increased and dynamic spatial DoFs inherent in near-field MIMO systems. This strategic exploitation is demonstrated to yield significant enhancements in both spectral efficiency and system reliability. Furthermore, the article delves into a detailed analysis of the multifaceted challenges associated with implementing this technology. Through this comprehensive evaluation, the work provides crucial insights into ongoing efforts to navigate these challenges and suggests potential pathways for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Receivers for Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has delved into advanced designs for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with integrated sensing functions. One promising concept is the hybrid RIS (HRIS), which blends sensing and reflecting meta-atoms. This enables HRIS to process signals, aiding in channel estimation (CE) and symbol detection tasks. This paper formulates semi-blind receivers for HRIS-aided wireless communications that enable joint symbol and CE at the HRIS and BS. The proposed receivers rely on a new tensor modeling approach for the signals received at both the HRIS and BS while exploiting a tensor signal coding scheme at the transmit side. Specifically, by capitalizing on the multilinear structures of the received signals, we develop iterative and closed-form receiver algorithms for joint estimation of the uplink channels and symbols at both the HRIS and the BS. Enabling joint channel and symbol estimation functionalities, the proposed receivers offer symbol decoding capabilities to the HRIS and ensure ambiguity-free separate CE without requiring an a priori training stage. We also study identifiability conditions ensuring a unique joint channel and symbol recovery and discuss the computational complexities and tradeoffs involved by the proposed semi-blind receivers. Our findings demonstrate the competitive performances of the proposed algorithms at the HRIS and the BS and uncover distinct performance trends based on the possible combinations of HRIS-BS receiver pairs. Finally, extensive numerical results elucidate the interplay between power splitting, symbol recovery, and CE accuracy in HRIS-assisted communications. Such insights are pivotal for optimizing receiver design and enhancing system performance in future HRIS deployments.</description>

      <title>Point Data for Site-Specific Mid-band Radio Propagation Channel Statistics in the Indoor Hotspot (InH) Environment for 3GPP and Next Generation Alliance (NGA) Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive work has been carried out in the past year by various organizations in an effort to determine standardized statistical channel impulse response (CIR) parameters for the newly-released mid-band spectrum (7.25 GHz -- 24.25 GHz) [1]--[5]. In this work, we show that the wireless community currently lacks a unified method for presenting key parameters required for transparency and utilization by several constituencies when presenting propagation data for use by standard bodies or third parties to create statistical CIR models. This paper aims to solve the existing problem by offering a standard method for providing key propagation parameters such as bandwidth, antenna beamwidth, noise-threshold level, and coarseness in point form, for use in creating standards or comparing parameters, rather than providing commonly-used cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots, which hide the observed key statistics on a location-by-location, point-by-point basis. The method for presenting propagation data, proposed here, may be used for statistical channel modeling of pooled datasets from many contributors, additionally also holding promise for exploring ray-tracing (e.g. site-specific) channel modeling. The indoor hotspot (InH) data collected in Spring2024 at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHZ by NYU WIRELESS [1]--[3] is provided for the first time in point form, to augment statistical models previously presented solely as CDFs, to demonstrate how a standardized approach to measurement data could allow others to utilize the site-specific locations and key channel parameters observed at each location, to better understand, vet, and build upon statistical or site-specific CIRs from the contributions of many different data sources.</description>

      <title>Upper limb surface electromyography -- geometry, spectral characteristics, temporal evolution, and demographic confounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-body-computer interfaces aim to provide a fluid and natural way for humans to interact with technology. Among noninvasive interfaces, surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals have shown particular utility. However, much remains unknown about how sEMG is affected by various physiological and anatomical factors and how these confounds might affect gesture decoding across individuals or groups. In this article, we show that sEMG signals evince non-Euclidean graph data structure that is defined by a set of orthogonal axes and explain the signal distribution shift across individuals. We provide a dataset of upper limb sEMG signals and physiological measures of 91 adults as they perform 10 different hand gestures. Participants were selected to be representative of various age groups (18to 92 years) and BMI (healthy, overweight, and obese). Additional anatomical or physiological measures that might impact sEMG signals were also collected, such as skin hydration and elasticity. The article describes the inherent structure of sEMG data and provides methods to construct differentiable signal features that can be used with machine learning algorithms that use backpropagation. We then analyze how those parameters correlate with various physiological measures to probe if they can induce bias against (or towards) certain population groups. We find that higher frequencies in sEMG, although comprising less power than lower ones, provide better gesture decoding and show less bias with regard to demographic, circumstantial, and physiological confounds (such as age, skin hydration, and skin elasticity).</description>

      <title>Double-Side Polarization and Beamforming Alignment in Polarization Reconfigurable MISO System with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization reconfigurable (PR) antennas enhance spectrum and energy efficiency between next-generation node B(gNB) and user equipment (UE). This is achieved by tuning the polarization vectors for each antenna element based on channel state information (CSI). On the other hand, degree of freedom increased by PR antennas yields a challenge in channel estimation with pilot training overhead. This paper pursues the reduction of pilot overhead, and proposes to employ deep neural networks (DNNs) on both transceiver ends to directly optimize the polarization and beamforming vectors based on the received pilots without the explicit channel estimation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional first-estimate-then-optimize scheme by maximum of 20% in beamforming gain.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking for MmWave Communication Systems via Cooperative Passive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a cooperative passive sensing framework for millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems is proposed and demonstrated in a scenario with one mobile signal blocker. Specifically, in the uplink communication with at least two transmitters, a cooperative detection method is proposed for the receiver to track the blocker's trajectory, localize the transmitters and detect the potential link blockage jointly. To facilitate detection, the receiver collects the signal of each transmitter along a line-of-sight (LoS) path and a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path separately via two narrow-beam phased arrays. The latter path should scatter at the mobile blocker, and hence it can be identified by the Doppler frequency. Comparing the received signals of both paths, the Doppler frequency and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the NLoS path can be estimated. To resolve the blocker's trajectory and the transmitters' locations, the receiver should continuously track the mobile blocker to accumulate sufficient numbers of the Doppler frequency and AoA versus time observations. Finally, a gradient-descent-based algorithm is proposed for joint detection. With the reconstructed trajectory, the potential link blockage can be predicted. It is demonstrated that the system can achieve decimeter-level localization and trajectory estimation, and predict the blockage time with an error less than 0.1 s.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design of Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC System based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework that leverages the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to analyze and optimize performance trade-offs in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We consider a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments (UEs) and detects multiple targets using shared antenna deployment. The proposed KLD-based approach provides a unified performance measure encompassing both UE error rate and target detection capability. We apply this approach on two well-known communication beamforming techniques, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF), and evaluate the effect on the radar subsystem. Furthermore, two optimization problems are formulated and solved. The first one optimizes the KLD of the radar subsystem for given constraints on the communication KLD, whereas the second one focuses on communication waveform KLD-based optimization and constrained radar KLD. These optimization problems are solved using a projected gradient method with an adaptive penalty for the radar waveform and a gradient-assisted interior point method for the communication waveform. Through theoretical derivations and extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that our approach can be a powerful tool for characterizing and optimizing the performance trade-offs of ISAC under various configurations. The results also show significant improvements in both sensing and communication performance by the KLD-optimized system compared to well-known benchmarks, such as conventional MRT and ZF for the communication subsystem, and the conventional identity covariance design for the radar subsystem. These findings support the holistic design and optimization of ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Estimation Errors of a Matrix of Transfer Functions onto Its Analytic Singular Values and Their Potential Algorithmic Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix of analytic functions A(z), such as the matrix of transfer functions in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, generally admits an analytic singular value decomposition (SVD), where the singular values themselves are functions. When evaluated on the unit circle, for the sake of analyticity, these singular values must be permitted of become negative. In this paper, we address how the estimation of such a matrix, causing a stochastic perturbation of A}(z), results in fundamental changes to the analytic singular values: for the perturbed system, we show that their analytic singular values lose any algebraic multiplicities and are strictly non-negative with probability one. We present examples and highlight the impact that this has on algorithmic solutions to extracting an analytic or approximate analytic SVD.</description>

      <title>Superposition of PRS and PDSCH for ISAC System: Spectral Efficiency Enhancement and Range Ambiguity Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the telecommunication companies' perspective, the preference for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for sixth-generation (6G) is to enhance existing infrastructure with sensing capabilities while minimizing network alterations and optimizing available resources. This prompts the investigation of ISAC leveraging the existing infrastructure of fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals as defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Additionally, improving spectral efficiency is crucial in scenarios with high demand for both communication and sensing applications to maintain the required quality of service (QoS). To address these challenges, we propose the superposition of the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for communication and the positioning reference signal (PRS) for sensing with proper power allocation. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm to reduce the interference for data decoding caused by PRS. Moreover, we introduce the joint exploitation of PRS and demodulation reference signal (DMRS) to prevent range ambiguity in the form of ghost targets. Through simulation analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating PDSCH and PRS symbols within a unified resource grid. Our results show that the introduced approaches not only eliminate range ambiguity when sensing targets from gNBs but also enhance spectral efficiency by reducing interference between PRS and PDSCH. Simulation results show throughput enhancement and up to 57% improvement in bit error rate (BER). This paves the way for supporting sensing applications in the forthcoming network generation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Device Caching and Handovers on the Performance of 3D UAV Networks with Blockages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an urban network characterized by blockages, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer ad-hoc coverage to mobile users with distinct service rate requirements. The UAV-BSs are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked-poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-base station (UAV-BS). Initially, we model the network blockages and analyze the association probabilities of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs using stochastic geometry. Subsequently, we derive the bth moment of the conditional success probability (CSP) and employ a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework of signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) taking into account the blockage distribution in the network. Furthermore, we proposea cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE). We evaluate the HO rate and average throughput experienced by users ensuring their service rate requirements are met. We demonstrate that LoS associations decrease as the network density increases due to the substantial increase of NLoS UAV-BSs in the network. Additionally, we show that the presence of blockages does not necessarily have a negative impact on network reliability</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework tailored for smart healthcare systems. The framework is evaluated in the context of smart healthcare, optimising the transmit beamforming matrix and semantic extraction ratio for improved data rates, sensing accuracy, and general data protection regulation (GDPR) compliance, while considering IoRT device computing capabilities. Semantic metrics such as semantic transmission rate and semantic secrecy rate are derived to evaluate data rate performance and GDPR risk, respectively, while the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) assesses sensing performance. Simulation results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in ensuring reliable sensing, high data rates, and secure communication.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system enabled by the extremely large-scale simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (XL-STARS). By optimizing the communication beamformer, the sensing signal covariance matrix, the XL-STARS phase shift, and the FA position vector, the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), as a metric for sensing performance, is minimized while ensuring the standard communication performance. A double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods is proposed to solve the non-convex minimization problem by decomposing it into three subproblems and optimizing the coupling variables for each subproblem iteratively. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless-Powered NOMA: Continuous and Discrete Positioning Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a movable antenna (MA)-enabled wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where multiple wireless devices (WDs) first harvest energy from the downlink (DL) signal broadcast by a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit information in the uplink (UL) using non-orthogonal multiple access. Unlike conventional WPCNs with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), this MA-enabled WPCN allows the MAs at the HAP and the WDs to adjust their positions twice: once before DL wireless power transfer and once before DL wireless information transmission. Our goal is to maximize the system sum throughput by jointly optimizing the MA positions, the time allocation, and the UL power allocation. Considering the characteristics of antenna movement, we explore both continuous and discrete positioning designs, which, after formulation, are found to be non-convex optimization problems. Before tackling these problems, we rigorously prove that using identical MA positions for both DL and UL is the optimal strategy in both scenarios, thereby greatly simplifying the problems and enabling easier practical implementation of the system. We then propose alternating optimization-based algorithms for the resulting simplified problems. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed continuous MA scheme can enhance the sum throughput by up to 395.71% compared to the benchmark with FPAs, even when additional compensation transmission time is provided to the latter; 2) a step size of one-quarter wavelength for the MA motion driver is generally sufficient for the proposed discrete MA scheme to achieve over 80% of the sum throughput performance of the continuous MA scheme; 3) when each moving region is large enough to include multiple optimal positions for the continuous MA scheme, the discrete MA scheme can achieve comparable sum throughput without requiring an excessively small step size.</description>

      <title>A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. Recognizing that the RIS control circuit, irrespective of its detailed architecture, can always be represented as a multi-port network with auxiliary ports terminated by tunable individual loads, we physics-compliantly express the BD-RIS-parametrized channel as a multi-port chain cascade of i) radio environment, ii) static parts of the control circuit, and iii) individually tunable loads. Thus, the cascade of the former two systems is terminated by a system that is mathematically always characterized by a diagonal matrix. This physics-compliant diagonal representation implies that existing algorithms for channel estimation and optimization for conventional ("diagonal") RIS can be readily applied to BD-RIS scenarios. We demonstrate this in an experimentally grounded case study. Importantly, we highlight that, operationally, an ambiguous characterization of the cascade of radio environment and the static parts of the control circuit is required, but not the breakdown into the characteristics of its two constituent systems nor the lifting of the ambiguities. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to derive or estimate the characteristics of the static parts of the control circuit for pedagogical purposes. The diagonal representation of BD-RIS-parametrized channels also enables their treatment with coupled-dipole-based models. We furthermore derive the assumptions under which the physics-compliant BD-RIS model simplifies to the widespread linear cascaded model.</description>

      <title>Direct Multipath-Based SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future wireless networks, the availability of information on the position of mobile agents and the propagation environment can enable new services and increase the throughput and robustness of communications. Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) aims at estimating the position of agents and reflecting features in the environment by exploiting the relationship between the local geometry and multipath components (MPCs) in received radio signals. Existing multipath-based SLAM methods preprocess received radio signals using a channel estimator. The channel estimator lowers the data rate by extracting a set of dispersion parameters for each MPC. These parameters are then used as measurements for SLAM. Bayesian estimation for multipath-based SLAM is facilitated by the lower data rate. However, due to finite resolution capabilities limited by signal bandwidth, channel estimation is prone to errors and MPC parameters may be extracted incorrectly and lead to a reduced SLAM performance. We propose a multipath-based SLAM approach that directly uses received radio signals as inputs. A new statistical model that can effectively be represented by a factor graph is introduced. The factor graph is the starting point for the development of an efficient belief propagation (BP) method for multipath-based SLAM that avoids data preprocessing by a channel estimator. Numerical results based on synthetic and real data in challenging single-input, single-output (SISO) scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in terms of localization and mapping accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge devices are being deployed at increasing volumes to sense and act on information from the physical world. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is often necessary to make this sensed data suitable for further processing $\unicode{x2013}$ such as by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms $\unicode{x2013}$ and for transmission over communication networks. Analog in-memory computing has been shown to be a fast and energy-efficient solution for processing edge AI workloads, but not for Fourier transforms. This is because of the existence of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which enormously reduces the complexity of the DFT but has so far belonged only to digital processors. Here, we show that the FFT can be mapped to analog in-memory computing systems, enabling them to efficiently scale to arbitrarily large Fourier transforms without requiring large sizes or large numbers of non-volatile memory arrays. We experimentally demonstrate analog FFTs on 1D audio and 2D image signals, using a large-scale charge-trapping memory array with precisely tunable, low-conductance analog states. The scalability of both the new analog FFT approach and the charge-trapping memory device is leveraged to compute a 65,536-point analog DFT, a scale that is otherwise inaccessible by analog systems and which is $&gt;$1000$\times$ larger than any previous analog DFT demonstration. The analog FFT also provides more numerically precise DFTs with greater tolerance to device and circuit non-idealities than a direct matrix-vector multiplication approach. We show that the extension of the FFT algorithm to analog in-memory processors leads to design considerations that differ markedly from digital implementations, and that analog Fourier transforms have a substantial power efficiency advantage at all size scales over FFTs implemented on state-of-the-art digital hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training on vast amounts of graph data is critical in real-world applications wherein labeled data is limited, such as molecule properties prediction or materials science. Existing approaches pre-train models for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within networks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised tasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that focuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us to capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local structures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding (WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order Permutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node connectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing positional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input graph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on graphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also domain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore paving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph foundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a parametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency up to arbitrarily low error. We also evaluate HOPE-WavePE on graph-level prediction tasks of different areas and show its superiority compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Feature Estimation of Global Language Processing in EEG Using Attention Maps</title>

Abstract: Understanding the correlation between EEG features and cognitive tasks is crucial for elucidating brain function. Brain activity synchronizes during speaking and listening tasks. However, it is challenging to estimate task-dependent brain activity characteristics with methods with low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, such as EEG, rather than methods with high spatial resolution, like fMRI. This study introduces a novel approach to EEG feature estimation that utilizes the weights of deep learning models to explore this association. We demonstrate that attention maps generated from Vision Transformers and EEGNet effectively identify features that align with findings from prior studies. EEGNet emerged as the most accurate model regarding subject independence and the classification of Listening and Speaking tasks. The application of Mel-Spectrogram with ViTs enhances the resolution of temporal and frequency-related EEG characteristics. Our findings reveal that the characteristics discerned through attention maps vary significantly based on the input data, allowing for tailored feature extraction from EEG signals. By estimating features, our study reinforces known attributes and predicts new ones, potentially offering fresh perspectives in utilizing EEG for medical purposes, such as early disease detection. These techniques will make substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Summit Vitals: Multi-Camera and Multi-Signal Biosensing at High Altitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video photoplethysmography (vPPG) is an emerging method for non-invasive and convenient measurement of physiological signals, utilizing two primary approaches: remote video PPG (rPPG) and contact video PPG (cPPG). Monitoring vitals in high-altitude environments, where heart rates tend to increase and blood oxygen levels often decrease, presents significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce the SUMS dataset comprising 80 synchronized non-contact facial and contact finger videos from 10 subjects during exercise and oxygen recovery scenarios, capturing PPG, respiration rate (RR), and SpO2. This dataset is designed to validate video vitals estimation algorithms and compare facial rPPG with finger cPPG. Additionally, fusing videos from different positions (i.e., face and finger) reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) of SpO2 predictions by 7.6\% and 10.6\% compared to only face and only finger, respectively. In cross-subject evaluation, we achieve an MAE of less than 0.5 BPM for HR estimation and 2.5\% for SpO2 estimation, demonstrating the precision of our multi-camera fusion techniques. Our findings suggest that simultaneous training on multiple indicators, such as PPG and blood oxygen, can reduce MAE in SpO2 estimation by 17.8\%.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled Near-Field Communications: Channel Modeling and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance wireless communication by allowing flexible antenna movement. To maximize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), larger movable regions are required, which may render the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers invalid. In light of it, we investigate in this paper MA-enabled near-field communications, where a base station (BS) with multiple movable subarrays serves multiple users, each equipped with a fixed-position antenna (FPA). First, we extend the field response channel model for MA systems to the near-field propagation scenario. Next, we examine MA-aided multiuser communication systems under both digital and analog beamforming architectures. For digital beamforming, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is utilized, where an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) across users is derived in closed form. A low-complexity algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) is then proposed to jointly optimize the antenna position vector (APV) and digital beamforming matrix (DBFM) to approach this bound. For analog beamforming, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is employed, and an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among users is derived. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize the APV, analog beamforming vector (ABFV), and power allocation until convergence. For both architectures, we further explore MA design strategies based on statistical channel state information (CSI), with the APV updated less frequently to reduce the antenna movement overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve performance close to the derived bounds and also outperform the benchmark schemes using dense or sparse arrays with FPAs.</description>

      <title>Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) have emerged as the preferred method for modeling complex interactions across diverse graph entities. While the theory of such models is well understood, their aggregation module has not received sufficient attention. Sum-based aggregators have solid theoretical foundations regarding their separation capabilities. However, practitioners often prefer using more complex aggregations and mixtures of diverse aggregations. In this work, we unveil a possible explanation for this gap. We claim that sum-based aggregators fail to "mix" features belonging to distinct neighbors, preventing them from succeeding at downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation (SSMA), a novel plug-and-play aggregation for MPGNNs. SSMA treats the neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and sequentially convolves them, inherently enhancing the ability to mix features attributed to distinct neighbors. By performing extensive experiments, we show that when combining SSMA with well-established MPGNN architectures, we achieve substantial performance gains across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many settings. We published our code at \url{https://almogdavid.github.io/SSMA/}</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Raman Spectroscopy-based Cyber-Marine Fish Biochemical Composition Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid and accurate detection of biochemical compositions in fish is a crucial real-world task that facilitates optimal utilization and extraction of high-value products in the seafood industry. Raman spectroscopy provides a promising solution for quickly and non-destructively analyzing the biochemical composition of fish by associating Raman spectra with biochemical reference data using machine learning regression models. This paper investigates different regression models to address this task and proposes a new design of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for jointly predicting water, protein, and lipids yield. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a successful study employing CNNs to analyze the biochemical composition of fish based on a very small Raman spectroscopic dataset. Our approach combines a tailored CNN architecture with the comprehensive data preparation procedure, effectively mitigating the challenges posed by extreme data scarcity. The results demonstrate that our CNN can significantly outperform two state-of-the-art CNN models and multiple traditional machine learning models, paving the way for accurate and automated analysis of fish biochemical composition.</description>

      <title>A multimodal LLM for the non-invasive decoding of spoken text from brain recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-related research topics in artificial intelligence have recently gained popularity, particularly due to the expansion of what multimodal architectures can do from computer vision to natural language processing. Our main goal in this work is to explore the possibilities and limitations of these architectures in spoken text decoding from non-invasive fMRI recordings. Contrary to vision and textual data, fMRI data represent a complex modality due to the variety of brain scanners, which implies (i) the variety of the recorded signal formats, (ii) the low resolution and noise of the raw signals, and (iii) the scarcity of pretrained models that can be leveraged as foundation models for generative learning. These points make the problem of the non-invasive decoding of text from fMRI recordings very challenging. In this paper, we propose and end-to-end multimodal LLM for decoding spoken text from fMRI signals. The proposed architecture is founded on (i) an encoder derived from a specific transformer incorporating an augmented embedding layer for the encoder and a better-adjusted attention mechanism than that present in the state of the art, and (ii) a frozen large language model adapted to align the embedding of the input text and the encoded embedding of brain activity to decode the output text. A benchmark in performed on a corpus consisting of a set of interactions human-human and human-robot interactions where fMRI and conversational signals are recorded synchronously. The obtained results are very promising, as our proposal outperforms the evaluated models, and is able to generate text capturing more accurate semantics present in the ground truth.

      <title>SWIM: Short-Window CNN Integrated with Mamba for EEG-Based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result. The source code is available at https://github.com/windowso/SWIM-ASAD.</description>

Abstract: We propose WildFusion, a novel approach for 3D scene reconstruction in unstructured, in-the-wild environments using multimodal implicit neural representations. WildFusion integrates signals from LiDAR, RGB camera, contact microphones, tactile sensors, and IMU. This multimodal fusion generates comprehensive, continuous environmental representations, including pixel-level geometry, color, semantics, and traversability. Through real-world experiments on legged robot navigation in challenging forest environments, WildFusion demonstrates improved route selection by accurately predicting traversability. Our results highlight its potential to advance robotic navigation and 3D mapping in complex outdoor terrains.</description>

      <title>Integrated RF Photonic Front-End Capable of Simultaneous Cascaded Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic (MWP) front-ends are capable of ultra-broadband signal reception and processing. However, state-of-the-art demonstrations are limited to performing only one specific functionality at any given time, which fails to meet the demands of advanced radio frequency applications in real-world electromagnetic environments. In this paper, we present a major departure from the current trend, which is a novel integrated MWP front-end capable of simultaneous cascaded functions with enhanced performances. Our integrated MWP front-end can delay or phase-shift signals within the selected frequency band while simultaneously suppressing noise signals in other frequency bands, resembling the function of a conventional RF front-end chain. Moreover, we implement an on-chip linearization technique to improve the spurious-free dynamic range of the system. Our work represents a paradigm shift in designing RF photonic front-ends and advancing their practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an update on the EAVI physiological interface, a wireless, microcontroller based hardware design for the acquisition of bioelectrical signals. The system has been updated to process electroencephalogram brain signals in addition to muscle electromyogram. The hardware/firmware system interfaces with host software carrying out feature extraction and signal processing. Recent advances in electronics have made physiological computing applications practical and feasible. However, there is a gap between high end biomedical equipment and consumer DIY solutions. The hardware design we present here bridges this gap, and combines a specialized biosignal acquisition chip mated with a general-purpose microcontroller. It is based on the Texas Instruments ADS129x family a single chip integrated solution for high quality biosignal amplification and digitization. It serves as analogue front end via programmable gain amplifiers to a 24bit delta-sigma analog-digital converter. The microcontroller is the STMicroelectronics STM32F427, a Cortex-M4 family microcontroller with floating point unit . In addition to EMG acquisition, the board includes a Kionix KX122 three-axis accelerometer. The TI and Kionix sensing chipts communicate with the ST microcontroller over an I2C digital serial bus. The board communicates with the host computer or rest of the music system wirelessly over Bluetooth LE 4.2 using an ST SPBTLE-1S transceiver. The board can also communicate over USB where it registers with the host as a class compliant audio and MIDI device. Audio and physiological signals are treated in the same signal processing chain using the OWL framework. The demo will show multichannel EMG, and single channel EEG. We call this hybridization ''ExG''. We will present documentation of the EAVI board used in the lab and on stage, in user studies with neuro-diverse musicians and trained instrumentalists, as well as in performance with the experimental all-female band, Chicks on Speed.</description>

      <title>Beacon based uplink transmission for lorawan direct to satellite internet of things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-to-satellite IoT DtS IoT communication structure is a promising solution to provide connectivity and extend the coverage of traditional low-power and long-range technologies, especially for isolated and remote areas where deploying traditional infrastructure is impracticable. Despite their bounded visibility, the Low Earth Orbit LEO satellites complement the terrestrial networks, offering broader gateway coverage and terrestrial network traffic offloading. However, the dynamics of LEO and the nature of such integration come with several challenges affecting the efficacy of the network. Therefore, this paper proposes Beacon based Uplink LoRaWAN BU LoRaWAN to enhance satellite-terrestrial communication efficiency. The proposed scheme exploits the LoRaWAN class B synchronization mechanism to provide efficient uplink transmission from LoRaWAN devices placed on the ground to satellite gateways. BU LoRaWAN proposes an uplink transmission slot approach to synchronize ground devices uplink traffic with LEO based orbiting gateways. It also uses a queue data structure to buffer end devices ready to send packets until the appropriate moment. BU LoRaWAN avoids possible transmission collision by optimizing a random transmission slot for an end device within the beacon window. The proposed system is implemented and evaluated using OMNeT network simulator and FLoRaSat framework. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system. BU-LoRaWAN achieves better performance compared to the standard LoRaWAN, which manages to deliver almost double the traffic delivered by the standard one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network where a source generates packets and forwards them to a network containing $n$ nodes. The nodes in the network use the asynchronous push, pull or push-pull gossip communication protocols to maintain the most recent updates from the source. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information in the network. Prior to this work, only the push gossiping protocol has been studied for age of information analysis. In this paper, we use the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) framework to obtain recursive equations for the expected version age of sets of nodes in the time limit. We then show that the pull and push-pull protocols can achieve constant version age, while it is already known that the push protocol can only achieve logarithmic version age. We then show that the push-pull protocol performs better than the push and the pull protocol. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations to evaluate these results.</description>

      <title>Proposal of protocols for speech materials acquisition and presentation assisted by tools based on structured test signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols for acquiring speech materials, making them reusable for future investigations, and presenting them for subjective experiments. We also provide means to evaluate existing speech materials' compatibility with target applications. We built these protocols and tools based on structured test signals and analysis methods, including a new family of the Time-Stretched Pulse (TSP). Over a billion times more powerful computational (including software development) resources than a half-century ago enabled these protocols and tools to be accessible to under-resourced environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-sensor Spatial Association using Joint Range-Doppler Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of localizing multiple targets using a single set of measurements from a network of radar sensors. Such "single snapshot imaging" provides timely situational awareness, but can utilize neither platform motion, as in synthetic aperture radar, nor track targets across time, as in Kalman filtering and its variants. Associating measurements with targets becomes a fundamental bottleneck in this setting. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient method to extract 2D position and velocity of multiple targets using a linear array of FMCW radar sensors by identifying and exploiting inherent geometric features to drastically reduce the complexity of spatial association. The proposed framework is robust to detection anomalies, and achieves order of magnitude lower complexity compared to conventional methods. While our approach is compatible with conventional FFT-based range-Doppler processing, we show that more sophisticated techniques for range-Doppler estimation lead to reduced data association complexity as well as higher accuracy estimates of target positions and velocities.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications: Unlocking Potentials and Shaping the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) communication networks are featured by integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), revolutionizing base stations (BSs) and terminals. Additionally, in the unfolding 6G landscape, a pivotal physical layer technology, the Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array (ELAA), assumes center stage. With its expansive coverage of the near-field region, ELAA's electromagnetic (EM) waves manifest captivating spherical wave properties. Embracing these distinctive features, communication and sensing capabilities scale unprecedented heights. Therefore, we systematically explore the prodigious potential of near-field ISAC technology. In particular, the fundamental principles of near-field are presented to unearth its benefits in both communication and sensing. Then, we delve into the technologies underpinning near-field communication and sensing, unraveling possibilities discussed in recent works. We then investigated the advantages of near-field ISAC through rigorous case simulations, showcasing the benefits of near-field ISAC and reinforcing its stature as a transformative paradigm. As we conclude, we confront the open frontiers and chart the future directions for near-field ISAC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Satellite Telecommunications Testbed (AISTT), part of the ESA project SPAICE, is focused on the transformation of the satellite payload by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies over available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AI-capable chips for onboard processing. The objectives include validating artificial intelligence-driven SATCOM scenarios such as interference detection, spectrum sharing, radio resource management, decoding, and beamforming. The study highlights hardware selection and payload architecture. Preliminary results show that ML models significantly improve signal quality, spectral efficiency, and throughput compared to conventional payload. Moreover, the testbed aims to evaluate the performance and the use of AI-capable COTS chips in onboard SATCOM contexts.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation Modeling and RS-LS Estimation of Near-Field Channels with Uniform Planar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) can offer massive spatial multiplexing gains in the radiative near-field region in beyond 5G systems. While near-field channel modeling for uniform linear arrays has been extensively explored in the literature, uniform planar arrays-despite their advantageous form factor-have been somewhat neglected due to their more complex nature. Spatial correlation is crucial for non-line-of-sight channel modeling. Unlike far-field scenarios, the spatial correlation properties of near-field channels have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we start from the fundamentals and develop a near-field spatial correlation model for arbitrary spatial scattering functions. Furthermore, we derive the lower dimensional subspace where the channel vectors can exist. It is based on prior knowledge of the three-dimensional coverage region where scattering clusters exists and we derive a tractable one-dimensional integral expression. This subspace is subsequently employed in a reduced-subspace least squares (RS-LS) estimation method for near-field channels, thereby enhancing performance over the traditional least squares estimator without the need for having full spatial correlation matrix knowledge.</description>

      <title>Anti-jamming Transmission of Downlink Cell Free Millimeter-Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, the maximization of resistible jamming power is studied for multi-user downlink millimeter-wave cell-free multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-MIMO) systems. We propose an alternate optimization-based anti-jamming hybrid beamforming (AO-AJHBF) scheme. For receiving beamforming, more practical prior about the jamming channel, i.e., second-order statistics rather than instantaneous information, is exploited via maximizing the generalized Rayleigh quotient. For transmitting beamforming, we use the max-min fairness principle and propose a low-complexity projected gradient ascent-based method to circumvent the excessive computation of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Simulations verify the performance advantage of proposed AO-AJHBF over schemes based on weighted minimum mean square error and SDR methods.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Multi-Object Estimation via Labeled Random Finite Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the Labeled Random Finite Set (LRFS) framework for multi-object systems-systems in which the number of objects and their states are unknown and vary randomly with time. In particular, we focus on state and trajectory estimation via a multi-object State Space Model (SSM) that admits principled tractable multi-object tracking filters/smoothers. Unlike the single-object counterpart, a time sequence of states does not necessarily represent the trajectory of a multi-object system. The LRFS formulation enables a time sequence of multi-object states to represent the multi-object trajectory that accommodates trajectory crossings and fragmentations. We present the basics of LRFS, covering a suite of commonly used models and mathematical apparatus (including the latest results not published elsewhere). Building on this, we outline the fundamentals of multi-object state space modeling and estimation using LRFS, which formally address object identities/trajectories, ancestries for spawning objects, and characterization of the uncertainty on the ensemble of objects (and their trajectories). Numerical solutions to multi-object SSM problems are inherently far more challenging than those in standard SSM. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we discuss state-of-the-art implementations that address key computational bottlenecks in the number of objects, measurements, sensors, and scans.</description>

      <title>A QoS-Aware Uplink Spectrum and Power Allocation with Link Adaptation for Vehicular Communications in 5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have proposed link adaptation-based joint spectrum and power allocation algorithms for the uplink communication in 5G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) systems. In C-V2X, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users share radio resources with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users. Existing works primarily focus on the optimal pairing of V2V and V2I users, assuming that each V2I user needs a single resource block (RB) while minimizing interference through power allocation. In contrast, in this work, we have considered that the number of RBs needed by the users is a function of their channel condition and Quality of Service (QoS) - a method called link adaptation. It effectively compensates for the frequent channel quality fluctuations at the high frequencies of 5G communication.5G uses a multi-numerology frame structure to support diverse QoS requirements, which has also been considered in this work.
  The first algorithm proposed in this article greedily allocates RBs to V2I users using link adaptation. It then uses the Hungarian algorithm to pair V2V with V2I users while minimizing interference through power allocation. The second proposed method groups RBs into resource chunks (RCs) and uses the Hungarian algorithm twice - first to allocate RCs to V2I users and then to pair V2I users with V2V users. Extensive simulations reveal that link adaptation increases the number of satisfied V2I users and their sum rate while also improving the QoS of V2I and V2V users, making it indispensable for 5G C-V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Density Adaptive Attention is All You Need: Robust Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a novel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities, including Speech, Text, and Vision. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism, implemented in a multi-head framework, enabling it to collectively model any probability distribution for dynamic recalibration of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements, especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art attention techniques in model performance, up to approximately +20% (abs.) in accuracy. Empirically, DAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness and versatility in handling data across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we introduce the Importance Factor, a new learning-based metric that enhances the explainability of models trained with DAAM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Ice-Filling: Near-Optimal Channel Estimation for Dense Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By deploying a large number of antennas with sub-half-wavelength spacing in a compact space, dense array systems(DASs) can fully unleash the multiplexing-and-diversity gains of limited apertures. To acquire these gains, accurate channel state information acquisition is necessary but challenging due to the large antenna numbers. To overcome this obstacle, this paper reveals that exploiting the high spatial correlation of DAS channels is crucial while designing the observation matrix for optimal/near-optimal channel estimation. Firstly, we prove that the observation matrix design is equivalent to a time-domain duality of multiple-input multiple-output precoding, which can be ideally addressed by the water-filling principle. For practical realizations, a novel ice-filling algorithm is proposed to design amplitude-and-phase controllable observation matrices, and a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to address the phase-only controllable case. Particularly, we prove that the ice-filling algorithm can be viewed as a ``quantized" water-filling algorithm. To support the sub-optimality of the proposed designs, we provide comprehensive analyses on the achievable mean square errors and their asymptotic expressions. Finally, numerical simulations verify that our proposed channel estimation designs can achieve the near-optimal performance and outperform existing approaches significantly.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: Unknown Noise level Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution, and ii) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the distribution. The first class of methods is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning, and the second class tends to be impractical, as the noise level is often unknown in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>
