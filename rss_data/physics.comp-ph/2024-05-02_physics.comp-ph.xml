      <title>General synthetic iterative scheme for rarefied gas mixture flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of rarefied gas mixtures with disparate mass and concentration is a huge research challenge. Based on our recent kinetic modelling for monatomic gas mixture flows, this problem is tackled by the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the mesoscopic kinetic and macroscopic synthetic equations are alternately solved by the finite-volume discrete velocity method. Three important features of GSIS are highlighted. First, the synthetic equations are precisely derived from the kinetic equation, naturally reducing to the Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum flow regime; in other flow regimes, the kinetic equation provides high-order closure of the constitutive relations to capture the rarefaction effects. Second, these synthetic equations, which can be solved quickly, help to adjust the kinetic system to relax rapidly toward the steady state. Furthermore, in such a two-way coupling, the constraint on the spatial cell size is relieved. Third, the linear Fourier stability analysis demonstrates that the error decay rate in GSIS is smaller than 0.5 for various combinations of mass, concentration and viscosity ratios, such that the error can be reduced by three orders of magnitude after 10 iterations. The efficiency and accuracy of GSIS are demonstrated through several challenging cases covering a wide range of mass ratio, species concentration, and flow speed.</description>

      <title>Multimodal reconstruction of TbCo thin film structure with Basyeian analysis of polarised neutron reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implemented the Bayesian analysis to the polarised neutron reflectivity data. Reflectivity data from a magnetic TbCo thin film structure was studied using the bundle of a Monte-Carlo Markov-chain algorithm, likelihood estimation, and error modeling. By utilizing the Bayesian analysis, we were able to investigate the uniqueness of the solution beyond reconstructing the magnetic and structure parameters. This approach has demonstrated its expedience as several probable reconstructions were found (the multimodality case) concerning the isotopic composition of the surface cover layer. Such multimodal reconstruction emphasizes the importance of rigorous data analysis instead of the direct data fitting approach, especially in the case of poor statistically conditioned data, typical for neutron reflectivity experiments. The analysis details and the discussion on multimodality are in this article.</description>

      <title>Solving Maxwell's equations with Non-Trainable Graph Neural Network Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational electromagnetics (CEM) is employed to numerically solve Maxwell's equations, and it has very important and practical applications across a broad range of disciplines, including biomedical engineering, nanophotonics, wireless communications, and electrodynamics. The main limitation of existing CEM methods is that they are computationally demanding. Our work introduces a leap forward in scientific computing and CEM by proposing an original solution of Maxwell's equations that is grounded on graph neural networks (GNNs) and enables the high-performance numerical resolution of these fundamental mathematical expressions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the update equations derived by discretizing Maxwell's partial differential equations can be innately expressed as a two-layer GNN with static and pre-determined edge weights. Given this intuition, a straightforward way to numerically solve Maxwell's equations entails simple message passing between such a GNN's nodes, yielding a significant computational time gain, while preserving the same accuracy as conventional transient CEM methods. Ultimately, our work supports the efficient and precise emulation of electromagnetic wave propagation with GNNs, and more importantly, we anticipate that applying a similar treatment to systems of partial differential equations arising in other scientific disciplines, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, can benefit computational sciences</description>

      <title>Implementation of a Mesh refinement algorithm into the quasi-static PIC code QuickPIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma-based acceleration (PBA) has emerged as a promising candidate for the accelerator technology used to build a future linear collider and/or an advanced light source. In PBA, a trailing or witness particle beam is accelerated in the plasma wave wakefield (WF) created by a laser or particle beam driver. The distance over which the drive beam evolves is several orders of magnitude larger than the wake wavelength. This large disparity in length scales is amenable to the quasi-static approach. Three-dimensional (3D), quasi-static (QS), particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, e.g., QuickPIC, have been shown to provide high fidelity simulation capability with 2-4 orders of magnitude speedup over 3D fully explicit PIC codes. We describe a mesh refinement scheme that has been implemented into the 3D QS PIC code, QuickPIC. We use a very fine (high) resolution in a small spatial region that includes the witness beam and progressively coarser resolutions in the rest of the simulation domain. A fast multigrid Poisson solver has been implemented for the field solve on the refined meshes and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based Poisson solver is used for the coarse mesh. The code has been parallelized with both MPI and OpenMP, and the parallel scalability has also been improved by using pipelining. A preliminary adaptive mesh refinement technique is described to optimize the computational time for simulations with an evolving witness beam size. Several test problems are used to verify that the mesh refinement algorithm provides accurate results. The results are also compared to highly resolved simulations with near azimuthal symmetry using a new hybrid QS PIC code QPAD that uses a PIC description in the coordinates ($r$, $ct-z$) and a gridless description in the azimuthal angle, $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Collective nature of high-Q resonances in finite-size photonic metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high quality-factor (high Q) resonances supported by periodic arrays of Mie resonators from the perspectives of both Bloch wave theory and multiple scattering theory. We reveal that, unlike a common belief, the bound states in the continuum (BICs) derived by the Bloch-wave theory do not directly determine the resonance with the highest Q value in large but finite arrays. Higher Q factors appear to be associated with collective resonances formed by nominally guided modes below the light line associated with strong effect of both electric and magnetic multipoles. Our findings offer valuable insights into accessing the modes with higher Q resonances via bonding modes within finite metastructures. Our results underpin the pivotal significance of magnetic and electric multipoles in the design of resonant metadevices and nonlocal flat-band optics. Moreover, our demonstrations reveal that coupled arrays of high-Q microcavities do not inherently result in a stronger light-matter interaction when compared to coupled low-Q nanoresonators. This result emphasizes the critical importance of the study of multiple light-scattering effects in cavity-based systems.</description>

      <title>Mortar Thin Shell Approximation for Analysis of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin layers can lead to unfavorable meshes in a finite element (FE) analysis. Thin shell approximations (TSAs) avoid this issue by removing the need for a mesh of the thin layer while approximating the physics across the layer by an interface condition. Typically, a TSA requires the mesh of both sides of the TSA interface to be conforming. To alleviate this requirement, we propose to combine mortar methods and TSAs for solving the heat equation. The mortar TSA method's formulation is derived and enables an independent discretization of the subdomains on the two sides of the TSA depending on their accuracy requirements. The method is verified by comparison with a reference FE solution of a thermal model problem of a simplified superconducting accelerator magnet.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised identification of local atomic environment from atomistic potential descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing local structures effectively is key to unraveling the origin of many physical phenomena. Unsupervised algorithms offer an effective way of handling systems in which order parameters are unknown or computationally expensive. By combining novel unsupervised algorithm (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection) with atomistic potential descriptors, we distinguish between various chemical environments with minimal computational overhead. In particular, we apply this method to silicon and water systems. The algorithm effectively distinguishes between solid structures and phases of silicon, including solid and liquid phases, and accurately identifies interstitial, monovacancy, and surface atoms in diamond structures. In the case of water, it is capable of identifying an ice nucleus in the liquid phase, demonstrating its applicability in nucleation studies.</description>

      <title>GROMACS on AMD GPU-Based HPC Platforms: Using SYCL for Performance and Portability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GROMACS is a widely-used molecular dynamics software package with a focus on performance, portability, and maintainability across a broad range of platforms. Thanks to its early algorithmic redesign and flexible heterogeneous parallelization, GROMACS has successfully harnessed GPU accelerators for more than a decade. With the diversification of accelerator platforms in HPC and no obvious choice for a multi-vendor programming model, the GROMACS project found itself at a crossroads. The performance and portability requirements, and a strong preference for a standards-based solution, motivated our choice to use SYCL on both new HPC GPU platforms: AMD and Intel. Since the GROMACS 2022 release, the SYCL backend has been the primary means to target AMD GPUs in preparation for exascale HPC architectures like LUMI and Frontier. SYCL is a cross-platform, royalty-free, C++17-based standard for programming hardware accelerators. It allows using the same code to target GPUs from all three major vendors with minimal specialization. While SYCL implementations build on native toolchains, performance of such an approach is not immediately evident. Biomolecular simulations have challenging performance characteristics: latency sensitivity, the need for strong scaling, and typical iteration times as short as hundreds of microseconds. Hence, obtaining good performance across the range of problem sizes and scaling regimes is particularly challenging. Here, we share the results of our work on readying GROMACS for AMD GPU platforms using SYCL, and demonstrate performance on Cray EX235a machines with MI250X accelerators. Our findings illustrate that portability is possible without major performance compromises. We provide a detailed analysis of node-level kernel and runtime performance with the aim of sharing best practices with the HPC community on using SYCL as a performance-portable GPU framework.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Particle-in-Cell Kinetic Plasma Simulations via Reduced-Order Modeling of Space-Charge Dynamics using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven reduced-order modeling of the space-charge dynamics for electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EMPIC) plasma simulations based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The dynamics of the charged particles in kinetic plasma simulations such as EMPIC is manifested through the plasma current density defined along the edges of the spatial mesh. We showcase the efficacy of DMD in modeling the time evolution of current density through a low-dimensional feature space. Not only do such DMD-based predictive reduced-order models help accelerate EMPIC simulations, they also have the potential to facilitate investigative analysis and control applications. We demonstrate the proposed DMD-EMPIC scheme for reduced-order modeling of current density, and speed-up in EMPIC simulations involving electron beam under the influence of magnetic field, virtual cathode oscillations, and backward wave oscillator.</description>

      <title>Graph topological transformations in space-filling cell aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM's graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.</description>

Abstract: Inertial effects should be considered for micro- and nano-swimmers moving in a low-density medium confined by irregular structures that create entropic barriers, where viscous effects are no longer paramount. Here, we present a separation mechanism of self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional asymmetric channel, which leads to the drift of particles of different masses in opposite directions. In particular, this mechanism is based on the combined action of the spatial asymmetry of the channel structure, the temporal asymmetry inherent in particles dynamics, and an external static force. This work is relevant for potential applications that can be found in the development of lab-on-a-chip devices and artificial channels for separating particles of different masses.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Ideal MHD Equations: Locally Divergence-Free and Positivity-Preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerically simulating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) poses notable challenges, including the suppression of spurious oscillations near discontinuities (e.g., shocks) and preservation of essential physical structures (e.g., the divergence-free constraint of magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure). This paper develops structure-preserving oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) schemes for ideal MHD. The schemes leverage a locally divergence-free (LDF) oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure to suppress spurious oscillations while retaining the LDF property of magnetic field and many desirable attributes of original DG schemes, such as conservation, local compactness, and optimal convergence rates. The OE procedure is based on the solution operator of a novel damping equation, a linear system of ordinary differential equations that are exactly solvable without any discretization. The OE procedure is performed after each Runge-Kutta stage and does not impact DG spatial discretization, facilitating its easy integration into existing DG codes as an independent module. Moreover, this paper presents a rigorous positivity-preserving (PP) analysis of the LDF OEDG schemes on Cartesian meshes, utilizing the optimal convex decomposition technique and the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) approach. Efficient PP LDF OEDG schemes are derived by incorporating appropriate discretization of Godunov-Powell source terms into only the discrete equations of cell averages, under a condition achievable through a simple PP limiter. Several one- and two-dimensional MHD tests verify the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed structure-preserving OEDG schemes.</description>
