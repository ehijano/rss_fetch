      <title>Curvature-Induced Magnon Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14283v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating magnon frequency combs (MFCs) with tunable spacing via a single-frequency driving is crucial for practical applications but it typically relies on complex spin textures like skyrmions or vortices. Here, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate MFC generation in geometrically curved ferromagnetic thin films using single-frequency microwave excitation, without topological spin textures. We first show that the curvature transforms the planar ferromagnetic resonance into a localized, redshifted magnon bound state, which, under non-resonant driving, activates sequential three-magnon scattering processes assisted by the curvature-driven effective anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It finally produces equally spaced, robust frequency combs with spacing exactly set by the bound mode frequency. Moreover, we find that the curvature gradient at the hybrid interface mimics an analog event horizon, with the bound state's redshift resembling gravitational effects in black hole physics. Micromagnetic simulations confirm these curvature-driven nonlinear phenomenon, unveiling a novel geometric strategy for controlling magnon interactions and advancing compact magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of second sound, and more broadly the ballistic transport of heat, is of central importance in heat dissipation from electronic devices at very short length and time scales. Specifically, there is an interest in the practical implications of violations of Fourier's law. Recently, we have developed a simulation approach based on thermal-response functions that is appropriate for elucidating physics beyond the diffusive regime, including time-dependent sources and second-sound propagation. The methods are applied to free-standing graphene simulated using molecular-dynamics (MD) with empirical potentials. The simulations predict a strong second-sound signal at T=300K for length scales of at least L=68.1nm. It is demonstrated that the second-sound dissipation time is determined primarily by decoherence that emerges from the details of the phonon band structure. It is also shown that the decay time for second sound depends sensitively on the length scale that characterizes the thermal excitation. This is in contrast with theories based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), where second-sound dissipation is determined primarily by the resistive anharmonic phonon scattering rate. Calculations using the linearized BTE are also presented, along with analysis of second sound based on the BTE. This approach results in significantly longer lifetimes for second sound in comparison to our MD simulation results. Predictions for the response due to time-dependent sources are also presented, including insight into how time-dependent sources could be tuned to result in weak or strong temperature oscillations, and how time-dependent experiments might probe the spectra associated with second sound. Results are discussed in the context of second sound in graphite in the temperature range from 100-200K.</description>

      <title>Dipolar quantum gases: from 3D to Low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Enhancement via Electronic and Phononic Channels in Staggered and Non-Staggered Dimerized Quantum Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing the quantum coherence and tunability of molecular-scale structures, we theoretically explore thermoelectric transport in ring-shaped molecular junctions featuring dimerized hopping integrals. By engineering alternating strong and weak bonds in both staggered and non-staggered configurations, we reveal a marked transmission asymmetry that drives a substantial enhancement in the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. To further steer transport behavior, we introduce controlled aperiodicity via site-energy modulations in unit cell format governed by the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) potential, a quasiperiodic landscape that enables tunable localization-delocalization transitions. This interplay between hopping dimerization and AAH-type disorder gives rise to energy filtering effects and a rich spectrum where extended and critical states coexist, amplifying the Seebeck coefficient while preserving finite electrical conductance. Through a comprehensive non-equilibrium Green's function analysis, we uncover how key device parameters, including disorder strength, dimerization amplitude, and lead-ring connectivity, collectively shape transport characteristics. Notably, asymmetric lead couplings are shown to enhance performance by leveraging quantum interference pathways. Our findings highlight a robust design strategy for optimizing nanoscale thermoelectric functionality, providing actionable insights for experimental realization in molecular electronic platforms.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>
