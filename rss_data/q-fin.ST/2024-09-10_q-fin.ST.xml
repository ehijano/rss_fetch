      <title>Predicting Foreign Exchange EUR/USD direction using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Foreign Exchange market is a significant market for speculators, characterized by substantial transaction volumes and high volatility. Accurately predicting the directional movement of currency pairs is essential for formulating a sound financial investment strategy. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of various machine learning models for predicting the daily directional movement of the EUR/USD currency pair in the Foreign Exchange market. The analysis includes both decorrelated and non-decorrelated feature sets using Principal Component Analysis. Additionally, this study explores meta-estimators, which involve stacking multiple estimators as input for another estimator, aiming to achieve improved predictive performance. Ultimately, our approach yielded a prediction accuracy of 58.52% for one-day ahead forecasts, coupled with an annual return of 32.48% for the year 2022.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is identified as a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Three different equilibrium states are distingushed, dominated by (i) small planar surfaces, (ii) large surfaces with high but finite genus, and (iii) foamy surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>
