      <title>Active grid turbulence anomalies through the lens of physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active grids operated with random protocols are a standard way to generate large Reynolds number turbulence in wind and water tunnels. But anomalies in the decay and third-order scaling of active-grid turbulence have been reported. We combine Laser Doppler Velocimetry and hot-wire anemometry measurements in a wind tunnel, with machine learning techniques and numerical simulations, to gain further understanding on the reasons behind these anomalies. Numerical simulations that incorporate the statistical anomalies observed in the experimental velocity field near the active grid can reproduce the experimental anomalies observed later in the decay. The results indicate that anomalies in experiments near the active grid introduce correlations in the flow that persist for long times, and result in the flow being statistically different from homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach to wall-shear stress quantification: From numerical training to zero-shot experimental application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate quantification of wall-shear stress dynamics is of substantial importance for various applications in fundamental and applied research, spanning areas from human health to aircraft design and optimization. Despite significant progress in experimental measurement techniques and post-processing algorithms, temporally resolved wall-shear stress dynamics with adequate spatial resolution and within a suitable spatial domain remain an elusive goal. To address this gap, we introduce a deep learning architecture that ingests wall-parallel velocity fields from the logarithmic layer of turbulent wall-bounded flows and outputs the corresponding 2D wall-shear stress fields with identical spatial resolution and domain size. From a physical perspective, our framework acts as a surrogate model encapsulating the various mechanisms through which highly energetic outer-layer flow structures influence the governing wall-shear stress dynamics. The network is trained in a supervised fashion on a unified dataset comprising direct numerical simulations of statistically 1D turbulent channel and spatially developing turbulent boundary layer flows at friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 390 to 1,500. We demonstrate a zero-shot applicability to experimental velocity fields obtained from Particle-Image Velocimetry measurements and verify the physical accuracy of the wall-shear stress estimates with synchronized wall-shear stress measurements using the Micro-Pillar Shear-Stress Sensor for Reynolds numbers up to 2,000. In summary, the presented framework lays the groundwork for extracting inaccessible experimental wall-shear stress information from readily available velocity measurements and thus, facilitates advancements in a variety of experimental applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents new nontrivial stochastic identities for random isotropic second rank tensor fields. They can be considered as criteria of statistical isotropy in turbulent flows of any nature. The case of axial symmetry is also considered. We confirm the validity of the identities using different direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>An efficient hp-Variational PINNs framework for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are able to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating the residuals of the PDEs into their loss functions. Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks (VPINNs) and hp-VPINNs use the variational form of the PDE residuals in their loss function. Although hp-VPINNs have shown promise over traditional PINNs, they suffer from higher training times and lack a framework capable of handling complex geometries, which limits their application to more complex PDEs. As such, hp-VPINNs have not been applied in solving the Navier-Stokes equations, amongst other problems in CFD, thus far. FastVPINNs was introduced to address these challenges by incorporating tensor-based loss computations, significantly improving the training efficiency. Moreover, by using the bilinear transformation, the FastVPINNs framework was able to solve PDEs on complex geometries. In the present work, we extend the FastVPINNs framework to vector-valued problems, with a particular focus on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional forward and inverse problems, including problems such as the lid-driven cavity flow, the Kovasznay flow, and flow past a backward-facing step for Reynolds numbers up to 200. Our results demonstrate a 2x improvement in training time while maintaining the same order of accuracy compared to PINNs algorithms documented in the literature. We further showcase the framework's efficiency in solving inverse problems for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by accurately identifying the Reynolds number of the underlying flow. Additionally, the framework's ability to handle complex geometries highlights its potential for broader applications in computational fluid dynamics. This implementation opens new avenues for research on hp-VPINNs, potentially extending their applicability to more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Flow Past a Wall-Mounted Dolphin Dorsal Fin at Low Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dolphin swimming has been a captivating area of study, yet the hydrodynamics of the dorsal fin remain underexplored. In this study, we present three-dimensional simulations of flow around a wall-mounted dolphin dorsal fin, derived from a real dolphin scan. The NEK5000 (spectral element method) is employed with a second-order hex20 mesh to ensure high accuracy and computational efficiency in the simulations. A total of 13 cases were simulated, covering angles of attack (AoA) ranging from $0^\circ$ to $60^\circ$ and Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re}$) between 691 and 2000. Our results show that both drag and lift increase significantly with the AoA. Almost no vortex is observed at $\text{AoA} = 0^\circ$, whereas complex vortex structures emerge for $\text{AoA} \geq 30^\circ$, including half-horseshoe, hairpin, arch, and wake vortices. This study offers insights that could inform the design of next-generation underwater robots, heat exchangers, and submarine sails.</description>

      <title>FEM-based Neural Networks for Solving Incompressible Fluid Flows and Related Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical simulation and optimization of technical systems described by partial differential equations is expensive, especially in multi-query scenarios in which the underlying equations have to be solved for different parameters. A comparatively new approach in this context is to combine the good approximation properties of neural networks (for parameter dependence) with the classical finite element method (for discretization). However, instead of considering the solution mapping of the PDE from the parameter space into the FEM-discretized solution space as a purely data-driven regression problem, so-called physically informed regression problems have proven to be useful. In these, the equation residual is minimized during the training of the neural network, i.e. the neural network "learns" the physics underlying the problem. In this paper, we extend this approach to saddle-point and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, respectively, namely stationary Stokes and stationary Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we propose a modification of the existing approach: Instead of minimizing the plain vanilla equation residual during training, we minimize the equation residual modified by a preconditioner. By analogy with the linear case, this also improves the condition in the present non-linear case. Our numerical examples demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the training effort and greatly increases accuracy and generalizability. Finally, we show the application of the resulting parameterized model to a related inverse problem.</description>

      <title>A Method of Fundamental Solutions for Large-Scale 3D Elastance and Mobility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is known to be effective for solving 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet boundary value problems in the exterior of a large collection of simple smooth objects. Here we present new scalable MFS formulations for the corresponding elastance and mobility problems. The elastance problem computes the potentials of conductors with given net charges, while the mobility problem -- crucial to rheology and complex fluid applications -- computes rigid body velocities given net forces and torques on the particles. The key idea is orthogonal projection of the net charge (or forces and torques) in a rectangular variant of a "completion flow". The proposal is compatible with one-body preconditioning, resulting in well-conditioned square linear systems amenable to fast multipole accelerated iterative solution, thus a cost linear in the particle number. For large suspensions with moderate lubrication forces, MFS sources on inner proxy-surfaces give accuracy on par with a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. Our several numerical tests include a suspension of 10000 nearby ellipsoids, using 26 million total preconditioned degrees of freedom, where GMRES converges to five digits of accuracy in under two hours on one workstation.</description>

      <title>The role of viscosity on drop impact forces on non-wetting surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$ -- one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data. The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>

      <title>Onset of global instability in a premixed annular V-flame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate self-excited axisymmetric oscillations of a lean premixed methane--air V-flame in a laminar annular jet. The flame is anchored near the rim of the centrebody, forming an inverted cone, while the strongest vorticity is concentrated along the outer shear layer of the annular jet. Consequently, the reaction and vorticity dynamics are largely separated, except where they coalesce near the flame tip. The global eigenmodes corresponding to the linearised reacting flow equations around the steady base state are computed in an axisymmetric setting. We identify an arc branch of eigenmodes exhibiting strong oscillations at the flame tip. The associated eigenvalues are robust with respect to domain truncation and numerical discretisation, and they become destabilised as the Reynolds number increases. The frequency of the leading eigenmode is found to correspond to the Lagrangian disturbance advection time from the nozzle outlet to the flame tip. Nonlinear time-resolved simulation further reveals notable hysteresis phenomena in the subcritical regime prior to instability. Hence, even when the flame is linearly stable, perturbations of sufficient amplitude can trigger limit-cycle oscillations and higher-dimensional dynamics sustained by nonlinear feedback. A Monte Carlo simulation of passive tracers in the unsteady flame suggests a nonlinear non-local instability mechanism. Notably, linear analysis of the subcritical time-averaged limit-cycle state yields eigenvalues that do not match the nonlinear periodic oscillation frequencies, attributed to the fundamentally nonlinear dynamics of the subcritical V-flame instability, where the dichromatic, non-local interaction cannot be approximated as a simple distortion of the mean flow.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of drag-inducing elements on a rough surface through convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of surface roughness on drag forces remains a significant challenge in fluid dynamics. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts drag solely by the topography of rough surfaces and is capable of discovering spatial patterns linked to drag-inducing structures. A CNN model was developed to analyze spatial information from the topography of a rough surface and predict the roughness function, $\Delta U^+$, obtained from direct numerical simulation. This model enables the prediction of drag from rough surface data alone, which was not possible with previous methods owing to the large number of surface-derived parameters. Additionally, the retention of spatial information by the model enables the creation of a feature map that accentuates critical areas for drag prediction on rough surfaces. By interpreting the feature maps, we show that the developed CNN model is able to discover spatial patterns associated with drag distributions across rough surfaces, even without a direct training on drag distribution data. The analysis of the feature map indicates that, even without flow field information, the CNN model extracts the importance of the flow-directional slope and height of roughness elements as key factors in inducing pressure drag. This study demonstrates that CNN-based drag prediction is grounded in physical principles of fluid dynamics, underscoring the utility of CNNs in both predicting and understanding drag on rough surfaces.</description>

      <title>Revisiting tea-leaf paradox with a deformable stirrer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tea-leaf paradox refers to the unexpected migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the latter is mixed with a rigid spoon. We propose here to revisit this paradox by considering the case of a deformable spoon, which consists of a floating ball attached to a soft string set in circular motion through its other end. Doing so, one introduces some coupling between the ball's trajectory and the flow generated by its motion, leading to surprising effects. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which challenges common intuition based on centrifugal force and enriches the original paradox. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. A model explaining these observations is proposed, and validated using experimental measurements of the generated flow. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, showing that the ball can robustly trap itself at the center of the flow generated by its past motion.</description>

      <title>Deep learning modelling of manufacturing and build variations on multi-stage axial compressors aerodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of deep learning to physical simulations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics have recently experienced a surge in interest, and their viability has been demonstrated in different domains. However, due to the highly complex, turbulent and three-dimensional flows, they have not yet been proven usable for turbomachinery applications. Multi-stage axial compressors for gas turbine applications represent a remarkably challenging case, due to the high-dimensionality of the regression of the flow-field from geometrical and operational variables. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a deep learning framework for predictions of the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors. A physics-based dimensionality reduction unlocks the potential for flow-field predictions, as it re-formulates the regression problem from an un-structured to a structured one, as well as reducing the number of degrees of freedom. Compared to traditional "black-box" surrogate models, it provides explainability to the predictions of overall performance by identifying the corresponding aerodynamic drivers. This is applied to model the effect of manufacturing and build variations, as the associated performance scatter is known to have a significant impact on $CO_2$ emissions, therefore posing a challenge of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application. The deployed model, is readily integrated within the manufacturing and build process of gas turbines, thus providing the opportunity to analytically assess the impact on performance with actionable and explainable data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensionality of three-dimensional, magnetically dominated, decaying turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is important in various astrophysical contexts, including early universe magnetic fields, star formation, turbulence in galaxy clusters, magnetospheres and solar corona. Previously known in the nonhelical case of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence, we show that magnetic reconnection is important also in the fully helical case and is likely the agent responsible for the inverse transfer of energy. Again, in the fully helical case, we find that there is a similarity in power law decay exponents in both 2.5D and 3D simulations. To understand this intriguing similarity, we investigate the possible quasi-two-dimensionalization of the 3D system. We perform Minkowski functional analysis and find that the characteristic length scales of a typical magnetic structure in the system are widely different, suggesting the existence of local anisotropies. Finally, we provide a quasi-two-dimensional hierarchical merger model which recovers the relevant power law scalings. In the nonhelical case, we show that a helicity-based invariant cannot constrain the system, and the best candidate is still anastrophy or vector potential squared, which is consistent with the quasi-two-dimensionalization of the system.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.</description>
