      <title>A numerical analysis of the impact of gas pressure and dielectric material on the generation of body force in an air gas plasma actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma technology has undeniably revolutionized industrial processes in recent decades. Atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) has emerged as a prominent and widely applicable tool in various scientific disciplines. Notably, plasma-assisted flow control has become a subject of intense interest, particularly applying surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators for aerodynamic flow control. In this study, a two-dimensional model of the SDBD plasma actuator is developed using the COMSOL Multiphysics program, incorporating air gas discharge reactions with N2/O2/Ar gases in specific ratios (0.78, 0.21, 0.01). The investigation focuses on the impact of dielectric materials (mica, silica glass, quartz, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) on plasma characteristics and body force within the plasma actuator under constant input parameters. Moreover, the study explores how variable pressure (760, 660, and 560 torr) in different applications influences plasma properties, ultimately affecting the magnitude of the body force in the plasma actuator. These findings contribute to optimizing plasma technology for flow control applications and enhance industrial efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of hydrodynamic plasma waveguides for multi-GeV laser-driven electron acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic plasma waveguides initiated by optical field ionization (OFI) have recently become a key component of multi-GeV laser wakefield accelerators. Here, we present the most complete and accurate experimental and simulation-based characterization to date, applicable both to current multi-GeV experiments and future 100 GeV-scale laser plasma accelerators. Crucial to the simulations is the correct modeling of intense Bessel beam interaction with meter-scale gas targets, the results of which are used as initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations are in good agreement with our experiments measuring evolving plasma and neutral hydrogen density profiles using two-color short pulse interferometry, enabling realistic determination of the guided mode structure for application to laser-driven plasma accelerator design.</description>

      <title>PM2D: A parallel GPU-based code for the kinetic simulation of laser plasma instabilities in large scale plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser plasma instabilities (LPIs) have significant influences on the laser energy deposition efficiency, hot electron generation, and uniformity of irradiation in inertial confined fusion (ICF). In contrast to theoretical analysis of linear development of LPIs, numerical simulations play a more and more important role in revealing the complex physics of LPIs. Since LPIs are typically a three-wave coupling process, the precise kinetic simulation of LPIs requires to resolve the laser period (around one femtosecond) and laser wavelength (less than one micron). In this paper, a full wave fluid model of LPIs is constructed and numerically solved by the particle-mesh method, where the plasma is described by macro particles that can move across the mesh grids freely. Based upon this model, a two-dimensional (2D) GPU code named PM2D is developed. It can simulate the kinetic effects of LPIs self-consistently as normal particle-in-cell (PIC) codes. Moreover, as the physical model adopted in the PM2D code is specifically constructed for LPIs, the required macro particles per grid in the simulations can be largely reduced and thus overall simulation cost is considerably reduced comparing with typical PIC codes. Moreover, the numerical noise in our PM2D code is much lower, which makes it more robust than PIC codes in the simulation of LPIs for the long-time scale above 10 picoseconds. After the distributed computing is realized, our PM2D code is able to run on GPU clusters with a total mesh grids up to several billions, which meets the typical requirements for the simulations of LPIs at ICF experimental scale with reasonable cost.</description>

      <title>A New Computational Method for Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport with its Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new computational method to explore astrophysical and heliophysical phenomena, especially those considerably influenced by non-thermal energetic particles. This novel approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating the non-thermal fluid pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the non-thermal fluid is evaluated from the energetic particle distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, which is solved using stochastic differential equations. We implement this method in the HOW-MHD code (Seo \&amp; Ryu 2023), which achieves 5th-order accuracy. We find that without spatial diffusion, the method accurately reproduces the Riemann solution in the hydrodynamic shock tube test when including the non-thermal pressure. Solving Parker's transport equation allows the determination of pressure terms for both relativistic and non-relativistic non-thermal fluids with adiabatic indices $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=4/3$ and $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=5/3$, respectively. The method also successfully replicates the Magnetohydrodynamic shock tube test with non-thermal pressure, successfully resolving the discontinuities within a few cells. Introducing spatial diffusion of non-thermal particles leads to marginal changes in the shock but smooths the contact discontinuity. Importantly, this method successfully simulates the energy spectrum of the non-thermal particles accelerated through shock, which includes feedback from the non-thermal population. These results demonstrate that this method is very powerful for studying particle acceleration when a significant portion of the plasma energy is taken by energetic particles.</description>

      <title>MESSENGER observations of Mercury's planetary ion escape rates and their dependence on true anomaly angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the escape of Mercury's sodium-group ions (Na+-group, including ions with m/q from 21 to 30 amu/e) and their dependence on true anomaly angle (TAA), i.e., Mercury's orbital phase around the Sun, using measurements from MESSENGER. The measurements are categorized into solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere, and further divided into four TAA intervals. Na+-group ions form escape plumes in the solar wind and magnetosheath, with higher fluxes along the solar wind's motional electric field. The total escape rates vary from 0.2 to 1 times 10^{25} atoms/s with the magnetosheath being the main escaping region. These rates exhibit a TAA dependence, peaking near the perihelion and similar during Mercury's remaining orbit. Despite Mercury's tenuous exosphere, Na+-group ions escape rate is comparable to other inner planets. This can be attributed to several processes, including that Na+-group ions may include several ion species, efficient photoionization frequency for elements within Na+-group, etc.</description>

      <title>Wakefield regeneration in a plasma accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma wakefields offer high acceleration gradients, orders of magnitude larger than conventional RF accelerators. However, the achievable luminosity remains relatively low, typically limited by the plasma recovery time and the charge which can be accelerated per shot. In this work, we show that a train of drive bunches can be harnessed to accelerate multiple witness bunches in a single shot. We demonstrate that periodically loading the wakefields removes the limit on the energy transfer from the drive beam to the plasma, which allows the luminosity to be increased. Proof-of-concept simulations for the AWAKE scheme are carried out to demonstrate the technique, achieving a doubling of the accelerated charge while exploiting only a fraction of the drive train.</description>

      <title>Observational characterisation of large-scale transport and horizontal turbulent diffusivity in the quiet Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is a magnetic star, and the only spatio-temporally resolved astrophysical system displaying turbulent MHD thermal convection. This makes it a privileged object of study to understand fluid turbulence in extreme regimes and its interactions with magnetic fields. Global analyses of high-resolution solar observations provided by the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory can shed light on the physical processes underlying large-scale emergent phenomena such as the solar dynamo cycle. Combining a Coherent Structure Tracking reconstruction of photospheric flows, based on photometric data, and a statistical analysis of virtual passive tracers trajectories advected by these flows, we characterise one of the most important such processes, turbulent diffusion, over an unprecedentedly long monitoring period of 6 consecutive days of a significant fraction of the solar disc. We first confirm, and provide a new global view of the emergence of a remarkable dynamical pattern of Lagrangian Coherent Structures tiling the entire surface. These structures act as transport barriers on the time and spatial scale of supergranulation and, by transiently accumulating particles and magnetic fields, regulate large-scale turbulent surface diffusion. We then further statistically characterise the turbulent transport regime using two different methods, and obtain an effective horizontal turbulent diffusivity $D=2-3\times10^8~\mathrm{m}^2~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on the longest timescales probed. This estimate is consistent with the transport coefficients required in large-scale mean-field solar dynamo models, and is in broad agreement with the results of global simulations. Our analysis may also have implications for understanding the connections between solar-surface, coronal and solar-wind dynamics, and provides valuable lessons to characterise turbulent transport in other, unresolved turbulent astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>PIC simulations of laser-induced proton acceleration by resonant nanoantennas for fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid recent development in laser technology and methods learned from relativistic heavy ion physics led to new possibilities for fusion. Using a Hydrogen rich UDMA-TEGDMA polymer fusion target, laser irradiation ionizes the target. If we implant nanoantennas into the target resonating to the laser light frequency massive number of electrons of the ionized plasma resonate within the nanoantenna forming a so called nanoplasmonic wave. Our kinetic model simulation with a Hydrogen target indicates that the field of these resonating electrons attracts and accelerates the surrounding protons of the plasma to multi-MeV energy. These protons are then energetic enough to achieve nuclear transmutation and fusion reactions. Without resonating nanoantenna there is no such collective proton acceleration, no energetic protons, and nuclear reactions at 30 mJ laser pulse energy.</description>

      <title>Laser Interactions with Gas Jets: EMP Emission and Nozzle Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage from high-power laser interactions with gas jets. As hot electrons are accelerated beyond the laser channel, they produce a positively-charged plasma that expands into the ambient gas until it reaches the gas jet nozzle. A strong plasma potential leads to electrical breakdown that ionises the gas even faster than the expanding plasma ions. When contact is made between the plasma and the conducting nozzle surface, a discharge current propagates to ground and an electromagnetic pulse is radiated via an antenna emission mechanism. Damage to gas jet nozzles is caused by heating from plasma ions rather than Ohmic heating via a discharge current. Our model agrees with experimental data from experiments on proton acceleration in near-critical plasmas at the Vulcan and VEGA-3 lasers.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted optical diagnostics on a cylindrical atmospheric pressure surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study explores combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with standard optical diagnostics (such as time-integrated emission spectroscopy and imaging) to accurately predict operating conditions and assess the emission uniformity of a cylindrical surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). It is demonstrated that ML can be complementary with these optical diagnostics and identify peculiarities associated with the discharge emission pattern at different high voltage waveforms (AC and pulsed) and amplitudes. By employing unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks) algorithms, the applied voltage waveform and amplitude are categorised and predicted based on correlations/differences identified within large amounts of corresponding data. PCA allowed us to effectively classify the voltage waveforms and amplitudes applied to the SDBD through a transformation of the spectroscopic/imaging data into principal components (PCs) and their projection to a two-dimensional PC space. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of the voltage amplitude is achieved using the MLP which is trained with PCA-preprocessed data. A particularly interesting aspect of this concept involves examining the uniformity of the emission pattern of the discharge. This is achieved by analysing spectroscopic data recorded at four different regions around the SDBD surface using the two ML-based techniques. These discoveries are instrumental in enhancing plasma-induced processes. They open up new avenues for real-time control, monitoring, and optimization of plasma-based applications across diverse fields such as flow control for the present SDBD.</description>

      <title>Electric field effects during disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Helmholtz decomposition separates the electric field in a plasma into the sum of a divergence-free, $\vec{E}_B$, and a curl-free, $\vec{E}_q$, part. The divergence-free part of $\vec{E}$ determines the evolution of the magnetic field. The curl-free part enforces quasi-neutrality, $\vec{E}_q=-\vec{\nabla}\Phi_q$. The quasi-neutrality potential is approximated by $T_e/e$, the electron temperature divided by the elementary charge. During tokamak disruptions, the magnetic surfaces are broken creating large regions of chaotic magnetic field lines. In each chaotic region, the parallel current density divided by $B$ relaxes toward a spatial constant by shear Alfv\'en waves. The potential $\Phi_q$ produces both a diffusion coefficient that is Bohm-like, $D_q\approx T_e/eB$, and a large scale flow $\approx T_e/eB a_T$ across the magnetic field lines, where $a_T$ is the scale of the large scale difference in temperature. This diffusion and flow are important for sweeping impurities into the core of a disrupting tokamak plasma.</description>

      <title>On the two-dimensional Brillouin flow</title>

Abstract: The Brillouin flow is a rectilinear, sheared electron fluid flow in a crossed electric field (E) and magnetic field (B), in the E x B direction with zero flow velocity and zero electric field at the surface with which the flow is in contact. It is broadly considered as the equilibrium electron flow in high power crossed-field devices including the magnetron and magnetically insulated transmission line oscillators. This paper provides an examination of Brillouin flow in two dimensions, in a cylindrical geometry where the anode radius changes abruptly at a single axial location while the cathode surface has a constant radius. Our simulation confirms the proof that there is no equilibrium Brillouin flow solution for such a geometry. It further reveals that this change in the anode radius introduces novel bunching of the electrons within the Brillouin hub. This bunching occurs at low frequencies and is very pronounced if the Brillouin flow is from the small gap region to the large gap region, but is minimal if the Brillouin flow is from the large gap region to the small gap region. New insights are provided into the physical processes that initiate and sustain the bunching processes that are unique for a crossed-field diode, as compared with a non-magnetized diode. We argue that this enhanced bunching, and its concomitant formation of strong vortices, is not restricted to an abrupt change in the anode-cathode gap spacing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection occurs ubiquitously in the universe and is often invoked to explain fast energy release and particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysics. The study of relativistic magnetic reconnection in the magnetically dominated regime has surged over the past two decades, revealing the physics of fast magnetic reconnection and nonthermal particle acceleration. Here we review these recent progresses, including the magnetohydrodynamic and collisionless reconnection dynamics as well as particle energization. The insights in astrophysical reconnection strongly connect to the development of magnetic reconnection in other areas, and further communication is greatly desired. We also provide a summary and discussion of key physics processes and frontier problems, toward a better understanding to the roles of magnetic reconnection in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edge truncation under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase, quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the negative permittivity background exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge states can exist within the shrunken structure by modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be excited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges. Our results show that the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

Abstract: Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting properties of solar bursts as well as sources viewed through the turbulent solar atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model from the kinetic scattering theory for solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The inferred velocities are consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities also appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.</description>
