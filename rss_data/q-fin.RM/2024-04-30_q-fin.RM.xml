      <title>Value-at-Risk- and Expectile-based Systemic Risk Measures and Second-order Asymptotics: With Applications to Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systemic risk measure plays a crucial role in analyzing individual losses conditioned on extreme system-wide disasters. In this paper, we provide a unified asymptotic treatment for systemic risk measures. First, we classify them into two families of Value-at-Risk- (VaR-) and expectile-based systemic risk measures. While VaR has been extensively studied, in the latter family, we propose two new systemic risk measures named the Individual Conditional Expectile (ICE) and the Systemic Individual Conditional Expectile (SICE), as alternatives to Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES). Second, to characterize general mutually dependent and heavy-tailed risks, we adopt a modeling framework where the system, represented by a vector of random loss variables, follows a multivariate Sarmanov distribution with a common marginal exhibiting second-order regular variation. Third, we provide second-order asymptotic results for both families of systemic risk measures. This analytical framework offers a more accurate estimate compared to traditional first-order asymptotics. Through numerical and analytical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of second-order asymptotics in accurately assessing systemic risk. Further, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between VaR-based and expectile-based systemic risk measures. Expectile-based measures output higher risk evaluation than VaR-based ones, emphasizing the former's potential advantages in reporting extreme events and tail risk. As a financial application, we use the asymptotic treatment to discuss the diversification benefits associated with systemic risk measures. The expectile-based diversification benefits consistently deduce an underestimation and suggest a conservative approximation, while the VaR-based diversification benefits consistently deduce an overestimation and suggest behaving optimistically.</description>

      <title>Innovative Application of Artificial Intelligence Technology in Bank Credit Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of technology, especially the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the risk management level of commercial banks is constantly reaching new heights. In the current wave of digitalization, AI has become a key driving force for the strategic transformation of financial institutions, especially the banking industry. For commercial banks, the stability and safety of asset quality are crucial, which directly relates to the long-term stable growth of the bank. Among them, credit risk management is particularly core because it involves the flow of a large amount of funds and the accuracy of credit decisions. Therefore, establishing a scientific and effective credit risk decision-making mechanism is of great strategic significance for commercial banks. In this context, the innovative application of AI technology has brought revolutionary changes to bank credit risk management. Through deep learning and big data analysis, AI can accurately evaluate the credit status of borrowers, timely identify potential risks, and provide banks with more accurate and comprehensive credit decision support. At the same time, AI can also achieve realtime monitoring and early warning, helping banks intervene before risks occur and reduce losses.</description>

      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of digital finance, the transition from centralized to decentralized trust mechanisms, primarily driven by blockchain technology, plays a critical role in shaping the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This paradigm shift raises questions about the traditional reliance on centralized trust and introduces a novel, decentralized trust framework built upon distributed networks. Our research delves into the consequences of this shift, particularly focusing on how incidents influence trust within cryptocurrency markets, thereby affecting trade behaviors in centralized (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We conduct a comprehensive analysis of various events, assessing their effects on market dynamics, including token valuation and trading volumes in both CEXs and DEXs. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of trust in directing user preferences and the fluidity of trust transfer between centralized and decentralized platforms. Despite certain anomalies, the results largely align with our initial hypotheses, revealing the intricate nature of user trust in cryptocurrency markets. This study contributes significantly to interdisciplinary research, bridging distributed systems, behavioral finance, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It offers valuable insights for the distributed computing community, particularly in understanding and applying distributed trust mechanisms in digital economies, paving the way for future research that could further explore the socio-economic dimensions and leverage blockchain data in this dynamic domain.</description>

      <title>Bertrand oligopoly in insurance markets with Value at Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2016 the operation of insurance companies in the European Union is regulated by the Solvency II directive. According to the EU directive the capital requirement should be calculated as a 99.5\% of Value at Risk. In this study, we examine the impact of this capital requirement constraint on equilibrium premiums and capitals. We discuss the case of the oligopoly insurance market using Bertrand's model, assuming profit maximizing insurance companies facing Value at Risk constraints. First we analyze companies' decision on premium level. The companies strategic behavior can result positive as well as negative expected profit for companies. The desired situation where competition eliminate positive profit and lead the market to zero-profit state is rare. Later we examine ex post and ax ante capital adjustments. Capital adjustment does not rule out market anomalies, although somehow changes them. Possibility of capital adjustment can lead the market to a situation where all of the companies suffer loss. Allowing capital adjustment results monopolistic premium level or market failure with positive probabilities.</description>

      <title>ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock performance is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our study introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal techniques to extract richer, more predictive insights. The model begins by summarizing the transcript's structure and analyzing the speakers' mode and confidence level by detecting variations in tone and pitch for audio. This analysis helps investors form an overview perception of the ECCs. Moreover, this model uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based methods to meticulously extract the focuses that have a significant impact on stock performance from an expert's perspective, providing a more targeted analysis. The model goes a step further by enriching these extracted focuses with additional layers of analysis, such as sentiment and audio segment features. By integrating these insights, the ECC Analyzer performs multi-task predictions of stock performance, including volatility, value-at-risk (VaR), and return for different intervals. The results show that our model outperforms traditional analytic benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of using advanced LLM techniques in financial analytics.</description>

      <title>To VaR, or Not to VaR, That is the Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider economic obstacles that limit the reliability and accuracy of value-at-risk (VaR). Investors who manage large market transactions should take into account the impact of the randomness of large trade volumes on predictions of price probability and VaR assessments. We introduce market-based probabilities of price and return that depend on the randomness of market trade values and volumes. Contrary to them, the conventional frequency-based price probability describes the case of constant trade volumes. We derive the dependence of market-based price volatility on the volatilities and correlation of trade values and volumes. In the coming years, that will limit the accuracy of price probability predictions to Gaussian approximations, and even the forecasts of market-based price volatility will be inaccurate and highly uncertain.</description>
