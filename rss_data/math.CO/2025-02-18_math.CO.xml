      <title>Regularities of Typical Sigma Index on Caterpillar Trees of Pendent Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a study of topological indices according to caterpillar trees through Albertson index $\operatorname{irr}(G)=\sum_{\operatorname{ur\in E}(G)}\left|d_G(u)-d_G(v)\right|$ and the sigma index and total sigma index $\sigma_{t}(G)=\sum_{1\leq i &lt; j \leq n} (d_{i}-d_{j})^{2}$, which analyses the maximum and minimum values for specific graph properties under certain restrictions of caterpillar tree, where albertson index on caterpillar tree define as $\operatorname{irr}(C(n,m))=\sum_{n=3, m=3}(m-2)(10n-1)$.
  Through the election of these topological indices, we provide efficient models of these indices on caterpillar trees, as it is known that the Albertson index is the basis on which most of the topological indices are built and we have shown this through the close correlation between the Albertson's index and the Sigma index.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Cycles in Signed and Multisigned Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed complete graph contains both positive and negative Hamiltonian cycles if and only if it also contains both positive and negative triangles. Otherwise, all Hamiltonian cycles are negative if and only if all triangles are negative and n is odd, while all Hamiltonian cycles are positive if and only if all triangles are negative and n is even, or all triangles are positive. Extending these results to multisigned complete graphs, we prove that such a graph contains at least two Hamiltonian cycles with different multisigns if and only if it contains at least two triangles with different multisigns.</description>

      <title>Trees with non log-concave independent set sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of trees with independence numbers going to infinity for which the log-concavity relation for the independent set sequence of a tree $T$ in the family fails at around $\alpha(T)\left(1-1/(16\log \alpha(T))\right)$. Here $\alpha(T)$ is the independence number of $T$. This resolves a conjecture of Kadrawi and Levit.</description>

      <title>Chords of longest cycles passing through a specified small set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture of Thomassen says that every longest cycle of a $3$-connected graph has a chord. Thomassen (2018) proved that if $G$ is $2$-connected and cubic, then any longest cycle must have a chord. He also showed that if $G$ is a $3$-connected graph with minimum degree at least $4$, then some of the longest cycles in $G$ must have a chord. Zhang (1987) proved that if $G$ is a $3$-connected simple planar graph which is 3-regular or has minimum degree at least $4$, then every longest cycle of $G$ must have a chord. Recently, Li and Liu showed that if $G$ is a $2$-connected cubic graph and $x, y$ are two distinct vertices of $G$, then every longest $(x,y)$-path of $G$ contains at least one internal vertex whose neighbors are all in the path. In this paper, we study chords of longest cycles passing through a specified small set and generalize Thomassen's and Zhang's above results by proving the following results. (i) Let $G$ be a $2$-connected cubic graph and $S$ be a specified set consisting of an edge plus a vertex. Then every longest cycle of $G$ containing $S$ must have a chord. (ii) Let $G$ be a $3$-connected graph with minimum degree at least $4$ and $e$ be a specified edge of $G$. Then some longest cycle of $G$ containing $e$ must have a chord. (iii) Let $G$ be a $3$-connected planar graph with minimum degree at least $4$. Suppose $S$ is a specified set consisting of either three vertices or an edge plus a vertex. Then every longest cycle of $G$ containing $S$ must have a chord. We also extend the above-mentioned result of Li and Liu for $2$-connected cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of consecutive patterns in flattened Catalan words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Catalan word $w$ is said to be flattened if the subsequence of $w$ obtained by taking the first letter of each weakly increasing run is nondecreasing. Let $\mathcal{F}_n$ denote the set of flattened Catalan words of length $n$, which has cardinality $\frac{3^{n-1}+1}{2}$ for all $n \geq 1$. In this paper, we consider the distribution of several consecutive patterns on $\mathcal{F}_n$. Indeed, we find explicit formulas for the generating functions of the joint distribution on $\mathcal{F}_n$ of several trios of patterns, along with an auxiliary parameter. As special cases of these formulas, we obtain the generating function for the distribution of all consecutive patterns of length two or three. The following equivalences with regard to being identically distributed on $\mathcal{F}_n$ arise when comparing the various generating functions and may be explained bijectively: $112\approx122$ and $211\approx221\approx231$. In addition, explicit expressions are found for the total number of occurrences on $\mathcal{F}_n$ of each pattern of length two or three as well as for the number of avoiders of each pattern. These results can be obtained as special cases of our more general formulas for the generating functions, but may be explained combinatorially as well, the arguments of which are featured herein.</description>

      <title>New Necessary Conditions for Existence of Strong External Difference Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong external difference families (SEDFs) were introduced by Paterson and Stinson as a more restrictive version of external difference families. SEDFs can be used to produce optimal strong algebraic manipulation detection codes. In this paper, we use the theory of cyclotomic fields, algebraic number theory and character theory to give some new necessary conditions for the existence of SEDFs. Based on the results of decomposition of prime ideals and Schmidt's field descent method, two exponent bounds of SEDFs are presented. Based on the field descent method, a special homomorphism from an abelian group to its cyclic subgroup and Gauss sums, some bounds for prime divisors of $v$ and some congruence relations between $k, m$ and $\lambda$ for $(v,m,k,\lambda)$-SEDFs with $m&gt;2$ are established.</description>

      <title>Counting alternating permutations with restricted prefix and suffix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Hasse diagrams and generating functions to count alternating permutations with restricted prefix and suffix of lengths 3 and 4. In other words, for an alternating permutation $\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3\cdots\sigma_{n}\in S_{n}$, we restrict length-3 prefixes $\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3$ to follow certain patterns, such as $231$ and $132$, or follow certain restrictions such as $\sigma_2 \geq \max\{\sigma_1,\sigma_3\}+2$, similarly for prefixes of length 4. We also study the enumeration of alternating permutations with restrictions on both prefix and suffix.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Green and Liebeck concerning codes in symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of the symmetric group $S_n$ and $r$ a positive integer. If for every $g\in S_n$, there are precisely $r$ pairs $(a,b)\in A\times B$ such that $g=ab$, then we say that $A$ divides $r S_n$; the subset $B$ is called a code with respect to $A$ and we write $r S_n=A\boldsymbol{\cdot}B$. In this paper, we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck \cite[Conjecture 2.3]{Green20} about codes in $S_n$. Let $n&gt;2k$ and let $j$ be such that $2^j\leqslant k&lt;2^{j+1}$. Suppose that $X = x^{S_n}$ is a conjugacy class in $S_n$ and $Y_k$ is the subgroup $S_k\times S_{n-k}$ of $S_n$, where the factor $S_k$ permutes the subset $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and the factor $S_{n-k}$ permutes the subset $\{k+1,\ldots,n\}$. We show that $r S_n=X\boldsymbol{\cdot}Y_k$ if and only if the cycle-type of $x$ has exactly one cycle of length $2^i$ for $0\leqslant i\leqslant j$ and all other cycles have length at least $k+1$.</description>

      <title>Bipartite graphs with the double Hall property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-neighborhood of a vertex set $A$ in a graph $G$, denoted by $N^2(A)$, is the set of vertices adjacent to at least two vertices in $A$. We say that a bipartite graph $G=(X, Y)$ with $|X| \geq 2$ satisfies the double Hall property (with respect to $X$) if $|N^2(A)| \geq |A|$ for any subset $A \subseteq X$ with $|A| \geq 2$. Kostochka et al. first conjectured that if a bipartite graph $G=(X, Y)$ satisfies a slightly weaker version of the double Hall property, then $G$ contains a cycle that covers all vertices of $X$. They verified their conjecture for $|X| \leq 6$. In this paper, we extend their result to $|X| = 7$. Later, Salia conjectured that every bipartite graph satisfying the double Hall property has a cycle covering all vertices of $X$. We show that Salia's conjecture is almost equivalent to a much weaker conjecture requiring vertices in $Y$ to have high degrees. By extending a result of Bar\'at et al., we also show that Salia's conjecture holds for some graphs where the vertices of $Y$ have degree either $2$ or very high. Finally, we establish a lower bound for the maximum degree of graphs satisfying the double Hall property and present deterministic and probabilistic constructions of such graphs that approach this bound.</description>

      <title>Higher Rank Macdonald Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce higher rank generalizations of Macdonald polynomials. The higher rank non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials are Laurent polynomials in several sets of variables which form weight bases for higher rank polynomial representations of double affine Hecke algebras with respect to higher rank Cherednik operators. We prove that these polynomials satisfy generalized versions of the classical Knop--Sahi relations and we give combinatorial descriptions of their weights. The higher rank symmetric Macdonald polynomials are defined as Hecke-symmetrizations of the higher rank non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials and form eigenbases for the spaces of Hecke-invariant higher rank polynomials with respect to generalized finite variable Macdonald operators. We prove that the higher rank symmetric Macdonald polynomials satisfy stability properties allowing for the construction of infinite variable limits. These higher rank symmetric Macdonald functions form eigenbases for certain representations of the (positive) elliptic Hall algebra with respect to generalized infinite variable Macdonald operators. Lastly, we show that the higher rank polynomial representations may be used to construct higher rank polynomial representations of the double Dyck path algebra. This is a copy of the author's accepted extended abstract for FPSAC2025.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nim is a well-known combinatorial game, in which two players alternately remove stones from distinct piles. A player who removes the last stone wins under the normal play rule, while a player loses under the mis\`ere play rule. In this paper, we propose a new variant of Nim with scoring that generalizes both the normal and mis\`ere play versions of Nim as special cases. We study the theoretical aspects of this extended game and analyze its fundamental properties, such as optimal strategies and payoff functions.</description>

      <title>Minimum forcing numbers of perfect matchings of circular and prismatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with a perfect matching. Denote by $f(G)$ the minimum size of a matching in $G$ which is uniquely extendable to a perfect matching in $G$. Diwan (2019) proved by linear algebra that for $d$-hypercube $Q_d$ ($d\geq 2)$, $f(Q_n)=2^{d-2}$, settling a conjecture proposed by Pachter and Kim in 1998. Recently Mohammadian generalized this method to obtain a general result: for a bipartite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, if there exists an involutory matrix $A$ on a field $F$ as a weighted adjacency matrix then $f(G\Box K_2)=\frac{n}{2}$. In this paper, under the same condition we obtain $f(G\Box C_{2k})=n ~(k\ge2)$. Also this method can be applied to some non-balanced bipartite graphs $G$ whenever $G$ admit a weighted bi-adjacency matrix with orthogonal rows.</description>

      <title>Linearization of multivariate discrete difference operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023 in (3), Uwe finds the explicit form of the map which is which is settled in ZN of finite functional degree and14 discusses how to compute its usual degree w.r.t to the derivative in the linear form, i.e. the product of ones formed by15 its orthogonal basis, and also introduces the notion of functional degree. It is the linear combination of the product of16 binomials. And this makes a big progress in the development of integer-valued functions. And this inspires the author17 to discuss this form in the separate form, i.e. the triple of finite set. In (18), Hrycaj discusses these operators in more18 abstract form. In this paper, we unifies two approaches. Seriously, we prove that the functional degree of integer-valued19 maps on integers which is computed with respect to its difference operators associated with its standard basis is exactly20 the same with the ones computed with respect to arbitrary mix discrete difference operators and we call it as multivariate21 difference operators. Since the functional degree agrees with the usual degree of integer-valued maps, we actually achieved22 the linearization of multivariate difference operators</description>

      <title>A signless Laplacian spectral Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovites theorem states that ex(n,F)=\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1)\bigg)\frac{n^{2}}{2}, where \chi(F) is the chromatic number of F. In 2009, Nikiforov proved a spectral analogue of the Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem. However, some known counterexamples (even cycles of length at least four) indicate that Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovites type result do not hold generally for the signless Laplacian spectral radius. In this note, we present a signless Laplacian spectral version of the Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem. More precisely, we show that if F is a graph with \chi(F)\geq3, then ex_{q}(n,F)=\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1)\bigg)2n, where ex_{q}(n,F):=\max \{q(G):|G|=n and F\nsubseteq G\} and q(G) is the signless Laplacian spectral radius of G.</description>

      <title>Excluded conformal minors of Birkhoff-von Neumann graphs with equal global forcing number and maximum anti-forcing number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global forcing number and maximum anti-forcing number of matchable graphs (graphs with a perfect matching) were proposed in completely different situations with applications in theoretical chemistry. Surprisingly for bipartite graphs and some nonbipartite graphs as solid bricks (or Birkhoff-von Neumann graphs) G, the global forcing number gf(G) is at least the maximum anti-forcing number Af(G). It is natural to consider when gf(G) = Af(G) holds. For convenience, we call a matchable graph G strongly uniform if each conformal matchable subgraph G' always satisfies gf(G') = Af(G'). In this article, by applying the ear decomposition theorem and discussing the existence of a Hamilton cycle with positions of chords, we give "excluded conformal minors" and "structural" characterizations of matchable bipartite graphs and Birkhoff-von Neumann graphs that are strongly uniform respectively.</description>

      <title>On rigid regular graphs and a problem of Babai and Pultr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is \textit{rigid} if it only admits the identity endomorphism. We show that for every $d\ge 3$ there exist infinitely many mutually rigid $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary odd girth $g\geq 7$. Moreover, we determine the minimum order of a rigid $d$-regular graph for every $d\ge 3$. This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/321108]. Further, we use our construction to show that every finite monoid is isomorphic to the endomorphism monoid of a regular graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb.~Theory, Ser.~B, 1980].</description>

      <title>Fan's condition for completely independent spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spanning trees $T_1,T_2, \dots,T_k$ of $G$ are $k$ completely independent spanning trees if, for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, the paths from $u$ to $v$ in these $k$ trees are pairwise edge-disjoint and internal vertex-disjoint. Hasunuma proved that determining whether a graph contains $k$ completely independent spanning trees is NP-complete, even for $k = 2$. Araki posed the question of whether certain known sufficient conditions for hamiltonian cycles are also also guarantee two completely independent spanning trees? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question for the Fan-type condition. Precisely, we proved that if $G$ is a connected graph such that each pair of vertices at distance 2 has degree sum at least $|V(G)|$, then $G$ has two completely independent spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of scattered binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( q \) be a prime power and \( n \) an integer. An \( \mathbb{F}_q \)-linearized polynomial \( f \) is said to be scattered if it satisfies the condition that for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{F}_q^n \setminus \{ 0 \} \), whenever \( \frac{f(x)}{x} = \frac{f(y)}{y} \), it follows that \( \frac{x}{y} \in \mathbb{F}_q \).
  In this paper, we focus on scattered binomials. Two families of scattered binomials are currently known: the one from Lunardon and Polverino (LP), given by $f(x) = \delta x^{q^s} + x^{q^{n-s}},$ and the one from Csajb\'ok, Marino, Polverino, and Zanella (CMPZ), given by $f(x) = \delta x^{q^s} + x^{q^{s + n/2}},$ where \( n = 6 \) or \( n = 8 \).
  Using algebraic varieties as a tool, we prove some necessary conditions for a binomial to be scattered. As a corollary, we obtain that when \( q \) is sufficiently large and \( n \) is prime, a binomial is scattered if and only if it is of the form (LP). Moreover we obtain a complete classification of scattered binomial in $\Fn$ when $n\leq8$ and $q$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>Determining the minimum size of maximal 1-plane graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1-plane graph is a graph together with a drawing in the plane in such a way that each edge is crossed at most once. A 1-plane graph is maximal if no edge can be added without violating either 1-planarity or simplicity. Let $m(n)$ denote the minimum size of a maximal $1$-plane graph of order $n$. Brandenburg et al. established that
  $m(n)\ge 2.1n-\frac{10}{3}$ for all $n\ge 4$, which was improved by Bar\'{a}t and T\'{o}th to $m(n)\ge \frac{20}{9}n-\frac{10}{3}$. In this paper, we confirm that $m(n)=\left\lceil\frac{7}{3}n\right\rceil-3$ for all $n\ge 5$.</description>

      <title>An edge labeling of graphs from Rados partition regularity condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ is called an AR-vertex, if $v$ has distinct edge weight sums for each distinct subset of edges incident on $v$. i.e., if $\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k\}$ are the edge labels of the edges incident on $v$, then the $2^k$ subset sums are all distinct. An injective edge labeling $f$ of a graph $G$ is said to be an AR-labeling of $G$, if $f:E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is such that every vertex in $G$ is an AR-vertex under $f$. A graph $G$ is said to be an AR-graph, if there exists an AR-labeling $f:E\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,m\}$, where $m$ denotes the number of edges of $G$. A study of AR-labeling and AR-graphs is initiated in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2-quasi best match graphs (2-qBMGs) are directed graphs that capture a
  notion of close relatedness in phylogenetics. Here, we investigate the
  undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG (un-2qBMG) and show that they
  contain neither a path $P_l$ nor a cycle $C_l$ of length $l\geq 6$ as an
  induced subgraph. This property guarantees the existence of specific
  vertex decompositions with dominating bicliques that provide further
  insights into their structure.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathcal{F}$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number of hypergraph graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Imolay, Karl, Nazy and V\'{a}li explored a generalization of Tur\'{a}n's forbidden subgraph problem and Ruzsa-Szrmer\'{e}di $(6,3)$-problem. They specifically studied the following question: for two graphs $F$ and $G$, determine the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of $F$ in a set of $n$ vertices such that there is no copies of $G$ whose edges come from different $F$-copies. The maximum number is denoted by $ex_F(n,G)$ and is called the {\em $F$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number} of $G$. One of their main results is that $ex_F(n,G)=o(n^2)$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $F$. We generalize the result to uniformly hypergraph using main tools of Hypergraph Regularity Lemma and Counting Lemma.</description>

      <title>Statistics on monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set NC^{mton}(n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set NC_2^{mton}(2n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. An important fact used in the calculations is that one has a natural and very convenient structure of rooted tree on the union of the NC^{mton}(n)'s, and likewise for the union of the NC_2^{mton}(2n)'s. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on NC^{mton}(n) and for the expectation of the area statistic on NC_2^{mton}(2n) turn out to yield a logarithmic regime.</description>

Abstract: The divisor graph is the non oriented graph whose vertices are the positive integers, and edges are the {a,b} such that a divides b or b divides a. Let F(x,y) be the maximum number of integers&lt;= x belonging in one of y pairwise disjoint simple path of the restriction of the divisor graph to integers &lt;= x. Our main result is the following. There exist two real numbers K &gt;c&gt;0 such that for every x and y with x&gt;=2y&gt;=2 , we have cx / log(x/y) &lt;= F(x,y) &lt;= Kx / log(x/y). It answers a question of Erd\"os.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12090v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly-doubly-regular tournaments have played significant roles in extremal graph theory. In this note, we construct new cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and determine their spectrum by establishing a new connection between cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and almost difference sets from combinatorial design theory. Furthermore, under the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F in analytic number theory, our results confirm the conjecture due to Sergey Savchenko (J. Graph Theory {\bf 83} (2016), 44--77) on the existence of infinitely many nearly-doubly-regular tournaments with the canonical spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish combinatorial links between the irreducible components of the fixed point locus of the Gieseker variety and the block theory of Ariki-Koike algebras. First, we describe the fixed point locus in terms of Nakajima quiver varieties over the McKay quiver of type A. We then reinterpret the dimension of an irreducible component as double the weight of a block. Cores of charged multipartitions have been defined by Fayers and further developed by Jacon and Lecouvey. In addition, we give a new way to compute the multicharge associated with the core of a charged multipartition. Finally, we also explain how the notion of core blocks, defined by Fayers, is interpreted on the geometric side using the deep connection between quiver varieties and affine Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Recursions for quadratic rotation symmetric functions weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Boolean function in $n$ variables is rotation symmetric (RS) if it is invariant under powers of $\rho(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (x_2, \ldots, x_n, x_1)$. An RS function is called monomial rotation symmetric (MRS) if it is generated by applying powers of $\rho$ to a single monomial. The author showed in $2017$ that for any RS function $f_n$ in $n$ variables, the sequence of Hamming weights $wt(f_n)$ for all values of $n$ satisfies a linear recurrence with associated recursion polynomial given by the minimal polynomial of a {\em rules matrix}. Examples showed that the usual formula for the weights $wt(f_n)$ in terms of powers of the roots of the minimal polynomial always has simple coefficients. The conjecture that this is always true is the Easy Coefficients Conjecture (ECC). The present paper proves the ECC if the rules matrix satisfies a certain condition. Major applications include an enormous decrease in the amount of computation that is needed to determine the values of $wt(f_n)$ for a quadratic RS function $f_n$ if either $n$ or the order of the recursion for the weights is large, and a simpler way to determine the Dickson form of $f_n.$ The ECC also enables rapid computation of generating functions which give the values of $wt(f_n)$ as coefficients in a power series.</description>

      <title>Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated.
  We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver.
  In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' &gt; f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</description>

      <title>Orbits on a product of two flags and a line and the Bruhat Order, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and let $\mathcal{B}_{n}$ be its flag variety. The standard Borel subgroup $B$ of upper triangular matrices acts on the product $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we study the $B$-orbits on the subvarieties $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathcal{O}_{i}$, where $\mathcal{O}_{i}$ is the $B$-orbit on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ containing the line through the origin in the direction of the $i$-th standard basis vector of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. For each $i=1,\dots, n$, we construct a bijection between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i}$ and certain pairs of Schubert cells in $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{B}_{n}$. We also show that this bijection can be used to understand the Richardson-Springer monoid action on such $B$-orbits in terms of the classical monoid action of the symmetric group on itself. We also develop combinatorial models of these orbits and use these models to compute exponential generating functions for the sequences $\{|B\backslash(\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathcal{O}_{i})|\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{|B\backslash (\mathcal{B}_{n}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1})|\}_{n\geq 1}$. In the sequel to this paper, we use the results of this paper to construct a correspondence between $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ and a collection of $B$-orbits on the flag variety $\mathcal{B}_{n+1}$ of $GL(n+1)$ and show that this correspondence respects closures relations and preserves monoid actions. As a consequence both closure relations and monoid actions for all $B$-orbits on $\mathcal{B}_{n}\times\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ can be understood via the Bruhat order by using our results in [CE].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explain four viewpoints on the local tropicalization of formal subgerms of toric germs, which is a local analog of the global tropicalization of subvarieties of algebraic tori. We start by illustrating some of those viewpoints for plane curve singularities, then we pass to arbitrary dimensions. We conclude by describing several variants and extensions of the notion of local tropicalization presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Algorithms for the Representation of integers by Binary Quadratic forms: Reduction to Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the quadratic Diophantine equation $x^2 + d y^2 = m$, where $d$ and $m$ are positive integers, Cornacchia's algorithm efficiently finds integer solutions when the factorization of $m$ is known. However, when $m$ is highly composite, i.e. has too many distinct prime factors, the algorithm's running time suddenly becomes exponentially large in the input size. In this paper, we demonstrate that solving the aforementioned Diophantine equation can be reduced to an instance of the subset sum problem, a well known weakly NP-complete problem in complexity theory. Leveraging this reduction, we propose multiple algorithms that solve this problem, given the factorization of $m$, based on different cases depending on $d$ and $m$. Particularly, one of our algorithms finds a solution in polynomial time when $d=\mathrm{polylog}(m)$, while the other achieves a quadratic speedup over Cornacchia's algorithm in the generic case. Recently, the problem of representing $m$ in this form has gained significant attention, particularly in applications to elliptic curves and isogeny-based cryptography where this algorithm is central to solving norm form equations.</description>

      <title>On a tree-based variant of bandwidth and forbidding simple topological minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain structure theorems for graphs excluding a fan (a path with a universal vertex) or a dipole ($K_{2,k}$) as a topological minor. The corresponding decompositions can be computed in FPT linear time. This is motivated by the study of a graph parameter we call treebandwidth which extends the graph parameter bandwidth by replacing the linear layout by a rooted tree such that neighbours in the graph are in ancestor-descendant relation in the tree.
  We deduce an approximation algorithm for treebandwidth running in FPT linear time from our structure theorems. We complement this result with a precise characterisation of the parameterised complexity of computing the parameter exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the saliency of neural networks and employ interpretable machine learning models to predict whether the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group are zero or not. Our models use triples of partitions as input features, as well as b-loadings derived from the principal component of an embedding that captures the differences between partitions. Across all approaches, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 83% and derive explicit formulas for a decision function in terms of b-loadings. Additionally, we develop transformer-based models for prediction, achieving the highest reported accuracy of over 99%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realise the Bott-Samelson resolutions of type A Schubert varieties as quiver Grassmannians. In order to explicitly describe this isomorphism, we introduce the notion of a \textit{geometrically compatible} decomposition for any permutation in $S_n$. For smooth type A Schubert varieties, we identify a suitable dimension vector such that the corresponding quiver Grassmannian is isomorphic to the Schubert variety. To obtain these isomorphisms, we construct a special quiver with relations and investigate two classes of quiver Grassmannians for this quiver.</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporal reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporal reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1801.09033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an action of the double coinvariant algebra
  $DR_n$ on the equivariant Borel-Moore homology of the affine flag variety
  $\widetilde{Fl}_n$ in type $A$, which has an explicit form in terms of
  the left and right action of the (extended) affine Weyl group and multiplication by Chern classes.
  Up to first order in the augmentation ideal, we show that it coincides with the
  action of the Cherednik algebra on the equivariant homology of
  the homogeneous affine Springer fiber $\widetilde{S}_{n,m} \subset \widetilde{Fl}_n$
  due to Yun and the second author, and therefore
  preserves the non-equivariant Borel-Moore homology groups $H_*(\widetilde{S}_{n,m})\hookrightarrow H_*(\widetilde{Fl}_n)$.
  We then define a geometric filtration
  $F_{a} H_*(\widetilde{S}_{n,n+1})=H_*(\widetilde{S}(a))$
  by closed subspaces $\widetilde{S}(a)\subset \widetilde{S}_{n,n+1}$,
  which we prove recovers the Garsia-Stanton descent order on $DR_n$. We use this to deduce an explicit monomial basis of $DR_n$, as well as an independent proof of the (non-compositional) Shuffle Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of generalized Paley graphs $\Gamma(k,q)=Cay(\mathbb{F}_q,R_k)$, undirected or not, with $R_k=\{x^k:x\in \mathbb{F}_q^*\}$ where $q=p^m$ with $p$ prime and $k\mid q-1$. We first show that the eigenvalues of $\Gamma(k,q)$ are given by the Gaussian periods $\eta_{i}^{(k,q)}$ with $0\le i\le k-1$. Then, we explicitly compute the spectrum of $\Gamma(k,q)$ with $1\le k \le 4$ and of $\Gamma(5,q)$ for $p\equiv 1\pmod 5$ and $5\mid m$. Also, we characterize those GP-graphs having integral spectrum, showing that $\Gamma(k,q)$ is integral if and only if $p$ divides $(q-1)/(p-1)$. Next, we focus on the family of semiprimitive GP-graphs. We show that they are integral strongly regular graphs (of pseudo-Latin square type). Finally, we characterize all integral Ramanujan graphs $\Gamma(k,q)$ with $1\le k \le 4$ or where $(k,q)$ is a semiprimitive pair.</description>

      <title>Sudoku Number of Corona of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph of order $n$ with chromatic number $\chi(G) = k$, let $S \subset V$ and let $C_0$ be a $k$-coloring of the induced subgraph $G[S]$. The coloring $C_0$ is called an extendable coloring, if $C_0$ can be extended to a $k$-coloring of $G$ and it is a Sudoku coloring of $G$ if the extension is unique. The smallest order of such an induced subgraph $G[S]$ of $G$ which admits a Sudoku coloring is called the Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G)$. In this paper, we first introduce the notion of uniquely color extendable vertex and then we obtain the lower and upper bounds for the Sudoku number of $G \circ K_1$. Some families of graphs which attain these bounds are also obtained. The exact value of the Sudoku number of corona of $C_n$, $W_n$ and $K_n$ with $K_1$ and $C_n \circ P_m$ are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov--Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Polynomial bounds for monochromatic tight cycle partition in $r$-edge-coloured $K_n^{(k)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K_n^{(k)}$ be the complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices. A $k$-uniform tight cycle is a $k$-graph with its vertices cyclically ordered so that every $k$ consecutive vertices form an edge and any two consecutive edges share exactly $k-1$ vertices. A result of Bustamante, Corsten, Frankl, Pokrovskiy and Skokan shows that all $r$-edge coloured $K_{n}^{(k)}$ can be partitioned into $c_{r,k}$ vertex disjoint monochromatic tight cycles. However, the constant $c_{r,k}$ is of tower-type. In this work, we show that $c_{r, k}$ is a polynomial in $r$.</description>

      <title>Submodular functions, generalized permutahedra, conforming preorders, and cointeracting bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular functions $z$ defined on the power set of a finite set are in bijection with generalized permutahedra $\egp(z)$. To any such $z$ we define a class of preorders, {\it conforming} preorders. We show the faces of $\egp(z)$ and the conforming preorders are in bijection. We investigate in detail this interplay between submodular functions and generalized permutahedra on one side, and conforming preorders on the other side, with many examples. In particular, the face poset structure of $\egp(z)$ correspond to two order relations $\lhd$ and $\btl$ on preorders, and we investigate their properties.
  Ardila and Aguiar \cite{AA2017} introduced a Hopf monoid of submodular functions/generalized permutahedra. We show there is a bimonoid of modular functions cointeracting in a non-standard way. By recent theory of L.Foissy \cite{Fo2022}, on double bialgebras we get a canonical polynomial associated to any submodular function.</description>

      <title>Misere Connect Four is Solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connect Four is a two-player game where each player attempts to be the first to create a sequence of four of their pieces, arranged horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, by dropping pieces into the columns of a grid of width seven and height six, in alternating turns. Misere Connect Four is played by the same rules, but with the opposite objective: do not connect four. This paper announces that Misere Connect Four is solved: perfect play by both sides leads to a second-player win. More generally, this paper also announces that Misere Connect $k$ played on a $w \times h$ board is also solved, but the outcome depends on the game's parameters $k$, $w$, and $h$, and may be a first-player win, a second-player win, or a draw. These results are constructive, meaning that we provide explicit strategies, thus enabling readers to impress their friends and foes alike with provably optimal play in the misere form of a table-top game for children.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of dimension $k\le 3$ have been determined there is some recent activity to settle the next case of dimension $k=3.5$. Here we complete dimension $k=3.5$ and give partial results for dimension $k=4$. We also solve the problem of the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of arbitrary dimension when assuming a sufficiently large minimum distance.</description>

      <title>The Jacobian of a regular orthogonal matroid and torsor structures on spanning quasi-trees of ribbon graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work of Chan--Church--Grochow and Baker--Wang shows that the set of spanning trees in a plane graph $G$ is naturally a torsor for the Jacobian group of $G$. Informally, this means that the set of spanning trees of $G$ naturally forms a group, except that there is no distinguished identity element. We generalize this fact to graphs embedded on orientable surfaces of arbitrary genus, which can be identified with ribbon graphs. In this generalization, the set of spanning trees of $G$ is replaced by the set of spanning quasi-trees of the ribbon graph, and the Jacobian group of $G$ is replaced by the Jacobian group of the associated regular orthogonal matroid $M$ (along with an associated regular representation of $M$). Our proof shows, more generally, that the family of "BBY torsors" constructed by Backman--Baker--Yuen and later generalized by Ding admit natural generalizations to (regular representations of) regular orthogonal matroids. In addition to shedding light on the role of planarity in the earlier work mentioned above, our results represent one of the first substantial applications of orthogonal matroids (also called "even delta-matroids" or "Lagrangian orthogonal matroids") to a natural combinatorial problem about graphs.</description>

      <title>Many pentagons in triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every $n$ vertex linear triple system with $m$ edges has at least $m^6/n^7$
  copies of a pentagon, provided $m&gt;100 \, n^{3/2}$. This provides the first nontrivial bound for a question posed by Jiang and Yepremyan.
  More generally, for each $ \ell \ge 2$, we prove that there is a constant $c$ such that if an $n$-vertex graph is $\varepsilon$-far from being triangle-free, with $\varepsilon \gg n^{-1/3\ell}$, then it has at least $c \, \varepsilon^{3\ell} n^{2\ell+1}$ copies of $C_{2\ell+1}$. This improves the previous best bound of $c \, \varepsilon^{4\ell+2} n^{2\ell+1}$ due to Gishboliner, Shapira and Wigderson.
  Our result also yields some geometric theorems, including the following. For $n$ large, every $n$-point set in the plane with at least $60\, n^{11/6}$ triangles similar to a given triangle $T$, contains two triangles sharing a special point, called the harmonic point. In the other direction, we give a construction showing that the exponent $11/6\approx 1.83$ cannot be reduced to anything smaller than $\log_3 6 \approx 1.726$.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that the restriction of a $k$ and $(k-1)$-component directed spanning forest of minimal weight to an atom of the subset algebra generated by the sets of vertices of trees of $k$-component minimal spanning forests is a tree. For spanning minimal forests consisting of fewer components, this property, generally speaking, does not exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing directed spanning forests of the minimum weight, in which the maximum possible degree of affinity between the minimum forests is preserved when the number of trees changes. The correctness of the algorithm is checked and its complexity is determined, which does not exceed $ O (N ^ 3) $ for dense graphs. The result of the algorithm is a set of related spanning minimal forests consisting of $ k $ trees for all admissible $ k $.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of finite high-dimensional random arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional random array on a nonempty set $I$ is a stochastic process $\boldsymbol{X}=\langle X_s:s\in \binom{I}{d}\rangle$ indexed by the set $\binom{I}{d}$ of all $d$-element subsets of $I$. We obtain structural decompositions of finite, high-dimensional random arrays whose distribution is invariant under certain symmetries.
  Our first main result is a distributional decomposition of finite, (approximately) spreadable, high-dimensional random arrays whose entries take values in a finite set; the two-dimensional case of this result is the finite version of an infinitary decomposition due to Fremlin and Talagrand. Our second main result is a physical decomposition of finite, spreadable, high-dimensional random arrays with square-integrable entries that is the analogue of the Hoeffding/Efron--Stein decomposition. All proofs are effective.
  We also present applications of these decompositions in the study of concentration of functions of finite, high-dimensional random arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arc space of an affine cone over a projective toric variety is known to be non-reduced in general. It was demonstrated recently that the reduced scheme structure is worth studying due to various connections with representation theory and combinatorics. In this paper we develop a general machinery for the description of the reduced arc spaces of affine cones over toric varieties. We apply our techniques to a number of classical cases and explore some connections with representation theory of current algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a series of conjectures on the stable tensor product of irreducible representations of symmetric groups, which are closely related to the reduced Kronecker coefficients. These conjectures are certain generalizations of Okounkov's conjecture on the log-concavity of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the Schur log-concavity theorem of Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy. We prove our conjectures in some special cases and discuss some implications of these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Polarizations of Artin monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any polarization of an Artin monomial ideal defines a triangulated ball. This proves a conjecture of A.Almousa, H.Lohne and the first author.
  Geometrically, polarizations of ideals containing $(x_1^{a_1}, \ldots, x_n^{a_n})$ define full-dimensional triangulated balls on the sphere which is the join of boundaries of simplices of dimensions $a_1-1, \cdots, a_n-1$. Every full-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay sub-complex of this joined sphere is of this kind, and these balls are constructible.
  Such a triangulated ball has a dual cell complex which is a sub-complex of the product of simplices of dimensions $a_1-1, \cdots a_n-1$. The associated cellular complex of this gives the minimal free resolution of the Alexander dual ideal of the triangulated ball. When the product of simplices is a hypercube, in many examples these dual cell complexes enables a classification of the range of polarizations of the Artin monomial ideal.
  We also show that the squeezed balls of G.Kalai \cite{Ka} derive from polarizations of Artin monomial ideals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triangle switch Markov chain is designed to generate random graphs with given degree sequence, but having more triangles than would appear under the uniform distribution. Transition probabilities of the chain depends on a parameter, called the activity, which is used to assign higher stationary probability to graphs with more triangles. In previous work we proved ergodicity of the triangle switch chain for regular graphs. Here we prove ergodicity for all sequences with minimum degree at least 3, and show rapid mixing of the chain when the activity and the maximum degree are not too large.</description>

We determined when $S(n)$ is a minimal separating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials having the least possible number of elements.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first prove that the type of an affine semigroup ring is equal to the number of maximal elements of the Ap\'ery set with respect to the set of exponents of the monomials, which form a maximal regular sequence. Further, we consider $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$ and prove that the notions of symmetric and almost symmetric $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups are independent of term orders. We further investigate the conductor and the Ap\'ery set of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup with respect to a minimal extremal ray. Building upon this, we extend the notion of reduced type to $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and study its extremal behavior. For all $d$ and fixed $e \geq 2d$, we give a class of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups of embedding dimension $e$ such that both the type and the reduced type do not have any upper bound in terms of the embedding dimension. We further explore irreducible decompositions of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup and give a lower bound on the irreducible components in an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, we deduce that for each positive integer $k$, there exists a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ such that the number of irreducible components of $S$ is at least $k$.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity on HDX II: Symmetrization and q-Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bourgain's symmetrization theorem is a powerful technique reducing boolean analysis on product spaces to the cube. It states that for any product $\Omega_i^{\otimes d}$, function $f: \Omega_i^{\otimes d} \to \mathbb{R}$, and $q &gt; 1$:
  $$||T_{\frac{1}{2}}f(x)||_q \leq ||\tilde{f}(r,x)||_{q} \leq ||T_{c_q}f(x)||_q$$ where $T_{\rho}f = \sum\limits \rho^Sf^{=S}$ is the noise operator and $\widetilde{f}(r,x) = \sum\limits r_Sf^{=S}(x)$ `symmetrizes' $f$ by convolving its Fourier components $\{f^{=S}\}_{S \subseteq [d]}$ with a random boolean string $r \in \{\pm 1\}^d$.
  In this work, we extend the symmetrization theorem to high dimensional expanders (HDX). Building on (O'Donnell and Zhao 2021), we show this implies nearly-sharp $(2{\to}q)$-hypercontractivity for partite HDX. This resolves the main open question of (Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu STOC 2022) and gives the first fully hypercontractive subsets $X \subset [n]^d$ of support $n\cdot\exp(\text{poly}(d))$, an exponential improvement over Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett's $n\cdot\exp(\exp(d))$ bound (BHKL STOC 2022). Adapting (Bourgain JAMS 1999), we also give the first booster theorem for HDX, resolving a main open question of BHKL.
  Our proof is based on two elementary new ideas in the theory of high dimensional expansion. First we introduce `$q$-norm HDX', generalizing standard spectral notions to higher moments, and observe every spectral HDX is a $q$-norm HDX. Second, we introduce a simple method of coordinate-wise analysis on HDX which breaks high dimensional random walks into coordinate-wise components and allows each component to be analyzed as a $\textit{$1$-dimensional}$ operator locally within $X$. This allows for application of standard tricks such as the replacement method, greatly simplifying prior analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low elements and Join Irreducible gates in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of some "regular" partitions in Coxeter groups. In particular, we study the tight gates of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that "tight gates" are the join-irreducible elements of the $m$-low Garside shadows for $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ under the right weak order. In the case of the tight gates of the cone type partition, we show that they also act as a "gate" of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without computing the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the tight gates of the cone type partition in these cases.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs with excluded minors and tree-structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{$r$-neighbourhood complexity} of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A~refinement of this notion is the \emph{$r$-profile complexity}, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than~$r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most~$t$, we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of~$t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results of Joret and Rambaud and answer a question of their paper [Combinatorica, 2024]. We also apply our methods to other classes of bounded expansion such as graphs excluding a fixed complete graph as a subdivision.
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most~$\ell$, we give the upper bound of $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$, which we improve to $O\left (k\cdot (r 2^k + r^2k^2) \right)$ in the case of chordal graphs and $O(k^2r)$ for interval graphs.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>Roller Coaster Gorenstein algebras and Koszul algebras failing the weak Lefschetz property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Roller Coaster Theorem from graph theory, we prove the existence of artinian Gorenstein algebras with unconstrained Hilbert series, which we call Roller Coaster algebras. Our construction relies on Nagata idealization of quadratic monomial algebras defined by whiskered graphs. The monomial algebras are interesting in their own right, as our results suggest that artinian level algebras defined by quadratic monomial ideals rarely have the weak Lefschetz property. In addition, we discover a large family of G-quadratic Gorenstein algebras failing the weak Lefschetz property.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Enriched Plane Curve Counting via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quadratically enriched count of rational curves in a smooth toric del Pezzo surface passing through $k$-rational points and pairs of conjugate points in quadratic field extensions $k\subset k(\sqrt{d_i})$ can be determined by counting certain tropical stable maps through vertically stretched point conditions with a suitable multiplicity. Building on the floor diagram technique in tropical geometry, we provide an algorithm to compute these numbers.
  Our tropical algorithm computes not only these new quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, but simultaneously also the complex Gromov-Witten invariant, the real Welschinger invariant counting curves satisfying real point conditions only, the real Welschinger invariant of curves satisfying pairs of complex conjugate and real point conditions, and the quadratically enriched count of curves satisfying $k$-rational point conditions.</description>

      <title>A LP-rounding based algorithm for soft capacitated facility location problem with submodular penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soft capacitated facility location problem (SCFLP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem, with its variants widely applied in the fields of operations research and computer science. In the SCFLP, given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of facilities and a set $\mathcal{D}$ of clients, each facility has a capacity and an open cost, allowing to open multiple times, and each client has a demand.
  This problem is to find a subset of facilities in $\mathcal{F}$ and connect each client to the facilities opened, such that the total cost including open cost and connection cost is minimied. SCFLP is a NP-hard problem, which has led to a focus on approximation algorithms. Based on this, we consider a variant, that is, soft capacitated facility location problem with submodular penalties (SCFLPSP), which allows some clients not to be served by accepting the penalty cost. And we consider the integer splittable case of demand, that is, the demand of each client is served by multiple facilities with the integer service amount by each facility. Based on LP-rounding, we propose a $(\lambda R+4)$-approximation algorithm, where $R=\frac{\max_{i \in \mathcal{F} }f_i}{\min_{i \in \mathcal{F} }f_i},\lambda=\frac{R+\sqrt{R^2+8R}}{2R}$. In particular, when the open cost is uniform, the approximation ratio is 6.</description>
