      <title>Bayesian Recovery for Probabilistic Coalition Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Coalition Structure Generation (PCSG) is NP-hard and can be recast as an $l_0$-type sparse recovery problem by representing coalition structures as sparse coefficient vectors over a coalition-incidence design. A natural question is whether standard sparse methods, such as $l_1$ relaxations and greedy pursuits, can reliably recover the optimal coalition structure in this setting. We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions. The concave sparsity penalty induced by SBL suppresses spurious near-duplicates and recovers the true coalition support with probability tending to one. This establishes a rigorous separation between convex, greedy, and Bayesian sparse approaches for PCSG.</description>

      <title>Congestion Mitigation in Vehicular Traffic Networks with Multiple Operational Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern commercial ground vehicles are increasingly equipped with multiple operational modalities (e.g., human driving, advanced driver assistance, remote tele-operation, full autonomy). These often rely on heterogeneous sensing infrastructures and distinct routing algorithms, which can yield misaligned perceptions of the traffic environment and route preferences. While such technologies accelerate the transition toward increasingly intelligent transportation networks, their current deployment fails to avoid challenges associated with selfish routing behavior, in which drivers or automated agents prioritize individually optimal routes instead of network-wide congestion mitigation. Existing traffic flow management strategies can address leader-follower dynamics in traffic routing problems but are not designed to account for vehicles capable of dynamically switching between multiple operational modes. This paper models the interaction between a vehicle control arbitration system and a multi-modal vehicle as a repeated single-leader, multiple follower Stackelberg game with asymmetric information. To address the intractability of computing an exact solution in this setting, we propose a Trust-Aware Control Trading Strategy (TACTS) utilizing a regret matching-based algorithm to adaptively update the arbitration system's mixed strategy over sequential, dynamic routing decisions. Theoretical results provide bounds on the realized total network travel time under TACTS algorithm relative to the system-optimal total network travel time. Experimental results of simulations between the system and a vehicle in several real-world traffic networks under various different congestion levels demonstrate that TACTS consistently reduces network-wide congestion and generally outperforms alternative routing and control-allocation strategies, particularly under high congestion and heavy induced vehicle flows.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Analysis of Blockchain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing blockchain consensus mechanisms by modeling blockchain growth as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) which we reduce to a set of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) through the use of the mean field approximation. This approach formalizes the decision-making process of miners in Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems and enables a principled examination of block selection strategies as well as steady state analysis of the induced Markov chain. By leveraging a mean field game formulation, we efficiently characterize the information asymmetries that arise in asynchronous blockchain networks.
  Our first main result is an exact characterization of the tradeoff between network delay and PoW efficiency--the fraction of blocks which end up in the longest chain. We demonstrate that the tradeoff observed in our model at steady state aligns closely with theoretical findings, validating our use of the mean field approximation.
  Our second main result is a rigorous equilibrium analysis of the Longest Chain Rule (LCR). We show that the LCR is a mean field equilibrium and that it is uniquely optimal in maximizing PoW efficiency under certain mild assumptions. This result provides the first formal justification for continued use of the LCR in decentralized consensus protocols, offering both theoretical validation and practical insights.
  Beyond these core results, our framework supports flexible experimentation with alternative block selection strategies, system dynamics, and reward structures. It offers a systematic and scalable substitute for expensive test-net deployments or ad hoc analysis. While our primary focus is on Nakamoto-style blockchains, the model is general enough to accommodate other architectures through modifications to the underlying MDP.</description>

      <title>Betting on Equilibrium: Monitoring Strategic Behavior in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many multi-agent systems, agents interact repeatedly and are expected to settle into equilibrium behavior over time. Yet in practice, behavior often drifts, and detecting such deviations in real time remains an open challenge. We introduce a sequential testing framework that monitors whether observed play in repeated games is consistent with equilibrium, without assuming a fixed sample size. Our approach builds on the e-value framework for safe anytime-valid inference: by "betting" against equilibrium, we construct a test supermartingale that accumulates evidence whenever observed payoffs systematically violate equilibrium conditions. This yields a statistically sound, interpretable measure of departure from equilibrium that can be monitored online. We also leverage Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedures to increase detection power in large games while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our framework unifies the treatment of Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria, offering finite-time guarantees and a detailed analysis of detection times. Moreover, we extend our method to stochastic games, broadening its applicability beyond repeated-play settings.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Free PSRO: Removing Game Simulation from Policy Space Response Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) combines game-theoretic equilibrium computation with learning and is effective in approximating Nash Equilibrium in zero-sum games. However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/enochliu98/SF-PSRO.</description>

      <title>Game connectivity and adaptive dynamics in many-action games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the typical structure of games in terms of their connectivity properties. A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-\zeta_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $\zeta_n&gt;0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $\zeta_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle. We thus complement our previous work to provide a more complete picture of game connectivity across different regimes.</description>

      <title>A non-parametric approach for estimating consumer valuation distributions using second price auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on online second price auctions, where bids are made sequentially, and the winning bidder pays the maximum of the second-highest bid and a seller specified reserve price. For many such auctions, the seller does not see all the bids or the total number of bidders accessing the auction, and only observes the current selling prices throughout the course of the auction. We develop a novel non-parametric approach to estimate the underlying consumer valuation distribution based on this data. Previous non-parametric approaches in the literature only use the final selling price and assume knowledge of the total number of bidders. The resulting estimate, in particular, can be used by the seller to compute the optimal profit-maximizing price for the product. Our approach is free of tuning parameters, and we demonstrate its computational and statistical efficiency in a variety of simulation settings, and also on an Xbox 7-day auction dataset on eBay.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, are increasingly able to mimic individual personalities. These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search for matches in contexts ranging from marriage to employment. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI representations and their imperfect representation of humans. An individual's personality is modeled as a point in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and an individual's AI representation is modeled as a noisy approximation of that personality. I compare two search regimes: Under in person search, each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them; under AI-mediated search, individuals match to the person with the most compatible AI representation. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters yields a better expected match than search over infinite AI representations. Moreover, when personality is sufficiently high-dimensional, simply meeting two people in person is more effective than search on an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>
