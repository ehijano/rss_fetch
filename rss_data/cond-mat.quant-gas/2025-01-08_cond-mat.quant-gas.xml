      <title>Splitting dynamics of quantized composite vortices in holographic miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability properties and splitting dynamics of multiply quantized vortices are the subject of interest in both theoretical and experimental investigations. Going beyond the regime of validity of Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we study the composite vortices in miscible strongly interacting binary superfluids by employing a holographic model that naturally incorporate finite temperature and dissipation. The composite vortices is classified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers and can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or counter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical transitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting behaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving the full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices. We find that the final states of all composite vortices are generally singly quantized vortices, and no additional long living vortex is formed due to strong dissipation. Our results highlight the important role of temperature and the distinction between dynamics of composite vortices in weakly interacting superfluids without dissipation and strongly interacting case with dissipation, shedding a new light on the understanding of quantum vortex and dynamical instabilities in multicomponent superfluids.</description>

      <title>Instability and particle current control of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional ring-shaped lattice with the Peierls phase and site-dependent modulations, where the condensate is confined in a single deep trap and the interparticle interaction strength is modulated by a time-periodic driving field. The system has a finite spectrum, which limits the excitation regimes, and the Peierls phase typically induces imbalanced complex hopping amplitudes in each direction, leading to nonzero net particle currents along the lattice chain, which can hold nearly persistent even when the driving field is turned off after half of the period. The configuration provides a specific way for the coherent control of particle currents in many-body quantum systems with the help of an external driving field, and promotes the possible applications in future closed-loop atom circuits.</description>

      <title>Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Landau level structure in dark optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>
