      <title>Magnetophoresis of Weakly Magnetic Nanoparticle Suspension Around a Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and numerical study into the magnetophoresis behavior of weakly magnetic nanoparticle suspensions in the vicinity of a wire under a non-uniform magnetic field and negligible inertia. The experiments were conducted within a closed rectangular cuvette, with a wire positioned between the poles of an electromagnet. Two types of nanoparticles, paramagnetic manganese oxide and diamagnetic bismuth oxide, were studied across a broad range of concentrations (10-100 mgL), magnetic field strengths (0.25-1 T), and wire diameters (0.8-3.17 mm). Our experimental findings reveal that upon the application of a magnetic field, paramagnetic nanoparticles experience a strong, attractive force toward the wire periphery. This force generates vortices and secondary flows around the wire, depleting particles from the bulk of the cuvette and concentrating them near the wire surface. The magnetophoresis dynamics of paramagnetic nanoparticles are shown to scale with their initial concentration, wire diameter, and the strength of the external magnetic field. In contrast, diamagnetic nanoparticles exhibit markedly different behavior, with their magnetophoresis dynamics showing minimal dependence on initial concentration and magnetic field strength, while being inversely proportional to the wire diameter. Multiphysics numerical simulations complement the experimental observations, revealing the formation of field-induced particle clusters in weakly paramagnetic nanoparticles, which enhance magnetophoresis. Additionally, the critical magnetic field threshold for the onset of cluster formation is found to be lower than those predicted by theoretical models for clustering in uniform magnetic fields. Under specific conditions, including high magnetic field strengths and elevated nanoparticle concentrations, diamagnetic nanoparticles appear to undergo field-induced clustering.</description>

      <title>Spatially Local Estimates of the Thermal Conductivity of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a spatial decomposition of the thermal conductivity, what we name "site-projected thermal conductivity", a gauge of the thermal conduction activity at each site. The method is based on the Green-Kubo formula and the harmonic approximation, and requires the force-constant and dynamical matrices and of course the structure of a model sitting at an energy minimum. Throughout the paper, we use high quality models previously tested and compared to many experiments. We discuss the method and underlying approximations for amorphous silicon, carry our detailed analysis for amorphous silicon, then examine an amorphous-crystal silicon interface, and representative carbon materials. We identify the sites and local structures that reduce heat transport, and quantify these (estimate the spatial range) over which these "thermal defects" are effective. Similarities emerge between these filamentary structures in the amorphous silicon network which impact heat transport, electronic structure (the Urbach edge) and electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Study of the uniform electron gas through parametrized partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy per particle, static structure factor, and momentum distribution of the uniform electron gas for different conditions defined by the dimensionless temperature $\Theta = 0.25 - 1.0$ and average interparticle distance $r_s = 0.5 - 80.0$ using path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. For small $r_\text{s}$ ($r_\text{s}\leq10$) where the sign problem is particularly challenging, we employ a recent approach based on an analytic continuation of the partition function using a real parameter $\xi$, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). We show that the results are in good agreement with other state-of-the-art methods while requiring low computational resources. For large $r_\text{s}$ ($r_\text{s}=80$), we use direct PIMC exploiting the good behaviour of the thermodynamic properties for negative $\xi$. In this framework we demonstrate that, for large $r_s$, the small negative region of $\xi$ can be utilized to extract information about the true fermionic limit, where $\xi = -1$.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for the ultralow room-temperature resistivity of SrMoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with exceptionally low resistivities at room temperature are currently heavily sought after for next-generation interconnects. SrMoO$_3$ has one of the lowest experimentally-reported room-temperature resistivities, yet the origin of this property has remained a mystery. Using the Boltzmann transport equation we determine that electron-phonon scattering limits transport at room temperature and is responsible for the approximate $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity at intermediate temperatures, often attributed to electron-electron Fermi-liquid scattering. We show that the weak electron-phonon coupling, which is similar to, e.g., copper, combined with high electron group velocities for states near the Fermi level, explains the low resistivity of SrMoO$_3$. Additionally, the strength of the electron-phonon coupling is found to be sensitive to structural distortions, which may explain disagreements in the literature between single crystal and thin film measurements. The electron-phonon scattering in SrMoO$_3$ is insensitive to static Coulomb interactions in the partially-filled transition-metal $d$ orbitals, in contrast to similar oxides such as SrVO$_3$. These findings have significant implications for theoretical interpretation of direct-current resistivity in transition-metal oxides and beyond.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.</description>

      <title>Entangled Interlocked Diamond-like (Diamondiynes) Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamondynes, a new class of diamond-like carbon allotropes composed of carbon with sp$^2$/sp$^3$-hybridized carbon networks, exhibit unique structural motifs that have not been previously reported in carbon materials. These architectures feature sublattices that are both interlocked and capable of relative movement. Using ab initio simulations, we have conducted an extensive investigation into the structural and electronic properties of five diamondyne structures. Our results show that diamondiynes are thermodynamically stable and exhibit wide electronic band gaps, from 2.2 eV to 4.0 eV. They are flexible yet highly resistant compared to other diamond-like structures. They have relatively small cohesive energy values, consistent with the fact that one diamondyne structure (2f-unsym) has already been experimentally realized. Our results provide new physical insights into diamond-like carbon networks and suggest promising directions for the development of porous, tunable frameworks with potential applications in energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological and Localization Phenomena in SSH Chains under Generalized AAH Modulation: A Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex, realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models, exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological systems.</description>

      <title>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO$_2$) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description>

      <title>Low and Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity in Mixed-Valent Sn$_2$S$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds of Sn, such as SnSe and SnS, exhibit novel phonon characteristics and low thermal conductivity, making them emerging star materials in the thermoelectric family. In this work, through the Boltzmann transport equation scheme and the Wigner thermal transport model, quasi-1D mixed-valent Sn$_2$S$_3$ were found to exhibit a low thermal conductivity along c-axis with a weak temperature dependence. The low thermal conductivity is attributed to the anharmonic rattling vibrations of weakly bonded Sn(II) atoms, which are influenced by the coulomb interaction of lone pairs at adjacent Sn(II) atoms. The rattling of Sn(II) induces low-frequency flat optical phonons and avoids crossing behavior. The atomic displacements and mean square displacement (MSD) analysis reveal that Sn(II) atoms exhibit significantly greater and anisotropic displacements compared to Sn(IV) and S, confirming that Sn(II) behaves as a rattler. The results obtained from this work suggest an opportunity to discover low thermal conductivity in mixed-valent compounds.</description>

      <title>Topotactic oxidation of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reveals new structural family: oxygen-intercalated layered perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered perovskites such as the Dion-Jacobson, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Aurivillius families host a wide range of correlated electron phenomena, from high-temperature superconductivity to multiferroicity. Here we report a new family of layered perovskites, realized through topotactic oxygen intercalation of La_{n+1}Ni_{n}O_{3n+1} (n=1-4) Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate thin films grown by ozone-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Post-growth ozone annealing induces a large c-axis expansion - 17.8% for La_{2}NiO_{4} (n=1) - that monotonically decreases with increasing n. Surface X-ray diffraction coupled with Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis reveals that this structural expansion arises from the intercalation of approximately 0.7 oxygen atoms per formula unit into interstitial sites within the rock salt spacer layers. The resulting structures exhibit a spacer layer composition intermediate between that of the Ruddlesden-Popper and Aurivillius phases, defining a new class of layered perovskites. Oxygen-intercalated nickelates exhibit metallicity and significantly enhanced nickel-oxygen hybridization, a feature linked to high-temperature superconductivity. Our work establishes topotactic oxidation as a powerful synthetic approach to accessing highly oxidized, metastable phases across a broad range of layered oxide systems, offering new platforms to tune properties via spacer-layer chemistry.</description>

      <title>GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Centrosymmetric Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric control of N\'eel vector is a central task of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. The major scheme so far relies on the linear N\'eel torque, which however is restricted to AFMs with broken inversion symmetry. Here, we propose a nonlinear N\'eel spin-orbit torque, uniquely enabling electric control in the vast class of centrosymmetric AFMs, where the existing scheme fails. Importantly, its intrinsic component, rooted in sublattice-resolved band quantum geometry, offers two additional advantages: It operates also in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM insulators, where linear torque is forbidden; and it has anti-damping character, making it more efficient in driving magnetic dynamics. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict large effect in MnRh and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, which can be readily detected in experiment. Our work unveils a new fundamental effect, offers a new strategy of electric control in AFM systems beyond the existing paradigm, and opens the door to the field of nonlinear AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Field-free perpendicular magnetization switching by altermagnet with collinear spin current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of collinear spin current (CSC), where both the propagation direction and spin-polarized direction aligned perpendicularly to the applied charge current, is crucial for efficiently manipulating systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy used in high-density magnetic recording. However, the efficient generation of CSC remains a challenge. In this work, based on the symmetry analysis, we propose that CSC can be effectively generated using altermagnets when the charge current is aligned along specific directions, due to spin-dependent symmetry breaking. This proposal is supported by density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) calculations on a series of altermagnetic materials, including RuO2, Mn5Si3, KRu4O8 and CuF2, where unusually large CSC is produced by the charge current along certain orientations. Furthermore, we introduce a physical quantity, the spin-splitting angle, to quantify the efficiency of CSC generated by the charge current. We find that the spin-splitting angle ranges from 0.24 to 0.57 in these altermagnets, which is significantly larger than the spin-Hall angle typically observed in the anomalous spin-Hall effect, where the spin-Hall angle is generally less than 0.1. Our findings provide an effective method for manipulating spin currents, which is advantageous for the exploration of altermagnetic spintronic devices with field-free perpendicular magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for electronic structure, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon calculations in locally disordered inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.</description>

      <title>Studying all-optical magnetization switching of GdFe by double-pulse laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tremendous interest in the technology and underlying physics of all-optical switching of magnetization brings up the question of how fast the switching can occur and how high the frequency of writing the data with ultrafast laser pulses can be. To answer this question, we excited a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy, the magnetization of which can be reversed by single laser pulses, a phenomenon known as toggle switching, by two pulses with a certain time delay in between. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Kerr microscopy for magnetic domain imaging, we explore the effects of varying fluences of the first and second pulse as well as the time delay between the two pulses. Our results show that when the fluence of the first pulse is adjusted just above the threshold of single-pulse switching, a second pulse with about 60% of the fluence of the first pulse, arriving only 3 ps later, switches the magnetization back. This reswitching persists up to about 40 ps pulse separation. We interpret the latter as the time required for the sample to cool down and remagnetize after the first pulse. For shorter time delays below about 2 ps, no re-switching occurs. However, the effect of the two pulses adds up, enabling switching for fluences of both pulses below the threshold for single-pulse switching. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations are used to model the experimental data, successfully confirming our results.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Electronic and Ionic Nonlinear Polarization Effects in the THz Kerr Response of LaAlO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses to intense terahertz (THz) fields provide unique insights into complex dynamics of contemporary material systems. However, the interpretation of the obtained data, in particular, distinguishing genuine ionic oscillations from the instantaneous electronic responses in THz Kerr effect remains challenging. Here, we combine two-dimensional Terahertz Kerr effect (2D-TKE) spectroscopy experiments and their modeling to unravel complex THz-induced temporal oscillations in twinned LaAlO$_3$ crystals at low temperatures. We identify the 1.1 THz mode as $E_g$ Raman phonon, while 0.86 THz and 0.36 THz signals are due to spurious effects resulting from the co- and counter-propagation of THz and optical probe pulses in birefringent twin domains. Furthermore, we determine that the $E_g$ mode is excited via a two-photon process, whereas THz pulse reflections at the sample surface produce a temporal response that can mimic anharmonic phonon coupling. Our findings highlight the importance of propagation effects in nonlinear THz experiments and provide a refined framework for interpreting THz polarization dynamics in birefringent crystals.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the E1 electron trap level in GaN and dilute AlxGa1-xN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of high-resolution Laplace deep-level transient spectroscopy (L-DLTS) measurements applied to the E1 and FeGa electron traps in dilute AlxGa1-xN films (x = 0.063), grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on Ammono-GaN substrates, are presented. It is shown that the electron emission signals associated with the E1 donor and the FeGa acceptor levels split into individual components due to the aluminium fluctuations in the nearest neighbour shells around the E1 and FeGa defects. The splitting patterns observed in the L-DLTS spectra are nearly identical for both signals. Furthermore, the ratios of peak magnitudes determined from the L-DLTS analysis for both the E1 and E3 traps are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminium atoms in the second nearest neighbour shell around a Ga lattice site in AlxGa1-xN with x = 0.063. These findings provide strong evidence that both the E1 and the FeGa trap states in dilute AlxGa1-xN are related to defects located in the Ga sublattice. To elucidate the origin of the E1 trap in AlxGa1-xN, we have performed a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defects in GaN and AlxGa1-xN using hybrid density functional calculations of transition levels and their associated shifts upon substitution of Ga neighbour atoms by Al. From analysis of the results, we find that the E1 electron trap in GaN and AlxGa1-xN is most likely related to a donor transition from a carbon or molybdenum impurity atom at the gallium site, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast non-volatile rewritable ferroaxial switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an important research frontier, with significant technological potential. Yet, current efforts are meeting some key challenges, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains due to uncompensated depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that do not break spatial-inversion or time-reversal symmetry, and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields. Yet, they are difficult to manipulate because external axial fields are not easily constructed with conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field made up of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated here may lead to a new platform for ultrafast information storage.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching of the N\'{e}el Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N\'{e}el vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of N\'{e}el vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\'{e}el vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. The consequent asymmetric spin torque leads to N\'{e}el vector dynamics fundamentally different from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\'{e}el vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>From stripes to hexagons: strain-induced 2D Pb phases confined between graphene and SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intercalation of metals beneath graphene offers a powerful route to stabilizing and protecting novel two-dimensional (2D) phases. The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defects and 4d/5d transition metal defects in Cr$_2$O$_3$: pathways to enhance the N\'eel temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to explore avenues to increase the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$) of the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr$_2$O$_3$ through doping. Employing the hybrid functional method, we calculate the formation energy of intrinsic defects and transition metal dopants (Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf) to assess their likelihood of formation. Intrinsic defect calculations indicate that Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies dominate under Cr-rich conditions, whereas Cr vacancies prevail under O-rich conditions. Notably, under Cr-rich conditions, the Fermi level can be pinned slightly above mid-gap due to the formation of Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies. To assess the influence of dopant on $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of Cr$_2$O$_3$, we calculate the enhancement of the exchange energy for the spin on the dopant site or on adjacent Cr site using the supercell method. Our study identifies isovalent Mo and W substitution on Cr site as the most promising candidates to increase N\'eel temperature due to the impurity-mediated enhanced exchange interaction for half-filled bands. Formation energy calculations indicate that Mo and W substitution on Cr are easier to form under Cr-rich conditions and a Fermi level near or slightly above the midgap renders a desirable neutral Mo and W defect. This is assisted by the formation of intrinsic Cr interstitial and O vacancy under Cr-rich conditions. These findings offer a route to utilize defects for higher $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and enhanced performance of Cr$_2$O$_3$ in magnetoelectric devices and furnish invaluable insights for directing subsequent experimental endeavors.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Machine Learning Analysis for Nanoscale Grain Mapping by Synchrotron Laue Microdiffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the grain morphology, orientation distribution, and crystal structure of nanocrystals is essential for optimizing the mechanical and physical properties of functional materials. Synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction is a powerful technique for characterizing crystal structures and orientation mapping using focused X-rays. However, when grain sizes are smaller than the beam size, mixed peaks in the Laue pattern from neighboring grains limit the resolution of grain morphology mapping. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach that combines a CNN feature extractor with a physics-informed filtering algorithm to overcome the spatial resolution limits of X-rays, achieving nanoscale resolution for grain mapping. Our PIML method successfully resolves the grain size, orientation distribution, and morphology of Au nanocrystals through synchrotron microdiffraction scans, showing good agreement with electron backscatter diffraction results. This PIML-assisted synchrotron microdiffraction analysis can be generalized to other diffraction-based probes, enabling the characterization of nanosized structures with micron-sized probes.</description>

      <title>Coupled reaction and diffusion governing interface evolution in solid-state batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>FerroAI: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Phase Diagrams of Ferroelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composition-temperature phase diagrams are crucial for designing ferroelectric materials, however predicting them accurately remains challenging due to limited phase transformation data and the constraints of conventional methods. Here, we utilize natural language processing (NLP) to text-mine 41,597 research articles, compiling a dataset of 2,838 phase transformations across 846 ferroelectric materials. Leveraging this dataset, we develop FerroAI, a deep learning model for phase diagram prediction. FerroAI successfully predicts phase boundaries and transformations among different crystal symmetries in Ce/Zr co-doped BaTiO$3$ (BT)-$x$Ba${0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$TiO$_3$ (BCT). It also identifies a morphotropic phase boundary in Zr/Hf co-doped BT-$x$BCT at $x = 0.3$, guiding the discovery of a new ferroelectric material with an experimentally measured dielectric constant of 9535. These results establish FerroAI as a powerful tool for phase diagram construction, guiding the design of high-performance ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Tracking and controlling monolayer water in gold nanogaps using extreme plasmonic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanogaps are ubiquitous across science, confining molecules and thus changing chemistries which influence many areas such as catalysis, corrosion, photochemistry, and sensing. However in ambient conditions, it is unclear how water solvates nanogaps and even if nominally dry, what water structure persists. Despite its low Raman cross-section, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables study of water at coinage metal surfaces. Using multi-layer aggregates of close-packed gold nanoparticles with sub-nanometre gaps precisely defined by organic spacer molecules, we achieve consistent and large SERS enhancements, enabling systematic study of water within these confined spaces. Ostensibly dry facets in air evidence water monolayer coatings, with hydrogen-bonding only reappearing upon immersion in solution. Under negative applied potentials, surface water is seen to re-orient at the metal facets with distinct spectral shifts among the quartet of vibrational peaks which correspond to those expected from water dimers. Comparing nanogaps in deuterated water also reveals how individual water molecules bind onto organic spacer molecules in such nanogaps. Realistic models of water dressing will enable better understanding of catalytic and contact chemistries.</description>

      <title>Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and their subclass, altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below N\'eel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Dispersion Surfaces Measurement Unlocks Photonic Crystal Slabs Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of dispersion surfaces (DS) in photonic crystals (PhCs) can predict striking topological features, such as bound states in the continuum (BICs). Precise measurement of dispersion, particularly near the {\Gamma}-point, is crucial since even subtle geometric deviations significantly impact the distribution of topological charges and associated polarization singularities. Here, we propose a novel technique to measure DS of PhC slabs with high angular accuracy of up to 3 x 10^(-4) radians, and spectral accuracy of 0.2 nm within an expanded region of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, our technique is diffraction- and aberration-free as it does not rely on optical imaging but rather on spectral mapping. The analysis of DS presented in this work demonstrates the robustness of our technique, and enables us to distinguish anisotropic BICs along a specific symmetry axis from isotropic states around the {\Gamma}-point. Moreover, the experimental DS obtained supply the information necessary to study and identify super-BICs.</description>

      <title>Time reversal symmetry breaking and s-wave superconductivity in CaPd2Ge2: A $\mu$SR study</title>

Abstract: ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ which crystallizes in ${\rm ThCr_2Si_2}$-type body-centered tetragonal structure exhibits superconductivity below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c} = 1.69$~K\@. We have investigated the superconducting gap structure and time reversal symmetry of the ground state in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ by means of muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our analysis of $\mu$SR data collected in transverse magnetic field reveals BCS superconductivity with a single-band $s$-wave singlet pairing and an isotropic energy gap having the value $2\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} = 3.50(1)$. Further, an increased relaxation rate in zero field $\mu$SR asymmetry spectra below $T_{\rm c} $ provides evidence for the presence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state revealing that the time-reversal symmetry is broken in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning accelerated finite-field simulations for electrochemical interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are of fundamental importance in electrocatalysis, batteries, and metal corrosion. Finite-field methods are one of most reliable approaches for modeling electrochemical interfaces in complete cells under realistic constant-potential conditions. However, previous finite-field studies have been limited to either expensive ab initio molecular dynamics or less accurate classical descriptions of electrodes and electrolytes. To overcome these limitations, we present a machine learning-based finite-field approach that combines two neural network models: one predicts atomic forces under applied electric fields, while the other describes the corresponding charge response. Both models are trained entirely on first-principles data without employing any classical approximations. As a proof-of-concept demonstration in a prototypical Au(100)/NaCl(aq) system, this approach not only dramatically accelerates fully first-principles finite-field simulations but also successfully extrapolates to cell potentials beyond the training range while accurately predicting key electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we reveal a turnover of both density and orientation distributions of interfacial water molecules at the anode, arising from competing interactions between the positively charged anode and adsorbed Cl$^-$ ions with water molecules as the applied potential increases. This novel computational scheme shows great promise in efficient first-principles modelling of large-scale electrochemical interfaces under potential control.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T &gt; 23 K) and low (T &lt; 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dirac edge states of two-dimensional altermagnetic topological crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the N\'eel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the N\'eel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [arXiv:2403.02279v3; Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarizationtensor. According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: an emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials is a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of antimony sulphoiodide investigated by means of ab-initio simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding the energy of visible light, thereby limiting their photovoltaic performance. SbSI, featuring a visible-range band gap, combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. Our calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct spin textures, relevant for spintronics applications. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting high photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it serves as a diagnostic tool to identify the material phase, with the circular photogalvanic effect reflecting spin texture changes. Thanks to its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising candidate for solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. Understanding and modulating the interaction between these extended defects and dopants are essential for advancing the design and performance of these novel semiconductors. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near the I$_3$-type defect.</description>

      <title>Conduction Band Structure and Ultrafast Dynamics of Ferroelectric $\alpha$-GeTe(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-GeTe(111) is a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric (FE) material for which a significative lattice distortion combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction gives rise to giant Rashba split states in the bulk and at the surface, which have been intensively probed in the occupied valence states using static angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Nevertheless, its unoccupied conduction band structure remains unexplored, in particular the experimental determination of its electronic band gap across momentum space. Using time-resolved ARPES based on high-repetition rate and extreme ultraviolet femtosecond (fs) laser, we unveil the band structure of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) in the full Brillouin zone, both in the valence and conduction states, as well as the exploration of its out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our work confirms the semiconducting nature of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) with a 0.85 eV indirect band gap, which provides an upper limit for comparison to density functional theory calculations. We finally reveal the dominant scattering mechanisms of photoexcited carriers during the out-of-equilibrium dynamics under fs light pulses.</description>

      <title>Unusual Valence of Ru and Prediction of Magnetism, Anomalous Hall Conductivity in a Newly Synthesized Double Perovskite Compound Ca_2CoRuO_6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a goal to expand on the family of double perovskite compounds, hosting 3d transition metal and 4d or 5d transition metal, two new ordered double perovskite compounds, Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ are synthesized following the prediction of a recent high throughput machine-learning study [Phys. Rev. Materials 3, 084418]. Experimentally both compounds are found to stabilize in monoclinic symmetry, which is consistent with the high-throughput prediction for Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$, but at odd for Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$. Among the two synthesized compounds, the properties of Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, investigated employing the first principles technique and model Hamiltonian calculation, appear promising. The monoclinic structured Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ is found to stabilize unusual 6+ valence of Ru, and support a half-metallic ground state with uncompensated net moment. As predicted by our first-principles study, the finite spin-orbit coupling at the Ru site contributes to the non-trivial topology of the band structure of monoclinic Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, resulting in a moderately large value of anomalous Hall conductivity. Our theoretical predictions should encourage further experimental investigation of this newly synthesized compound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mg2X (X=Si, Ge, Sn) based alloy is an eco-friendly thermoelectric material for mid-temperature applications. The Mg2Si1-xSnx and Mg2Ge1-xSnx alloys can be phase-separated into Si(Ge)- and Sn-rich phases during material synthesis, leading to a nanocomposite with locally varying electronic band structure. First-principles calculations reveal that the valence band offset is eight-times larger than the conduction band offset at the interface between Si- and Sn-rich phases for x=0.6, showing type-I and asymmetric band alignment (0.092 eV versus 0.013 eV). Using Boltzmann transport theory and thermionic emission calculations, we show that the large valence band energy discontinuity could allow for energy filtering effects to take place that can potentially increase the power factor substantially in the p-type material system if designed appropriately.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Learning Radical Excited States from Sparse Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emissive organic radicals are currently of great interest for their potential use in the next generation of highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices and as molecular qubits. However, simulating their optoelectronic properties is challenging, largely due to spin-contamination and the multireference character of their excited states. Here we present a data-driven approach where, for the first time, the excited electronic states of organic radicals are learned directly from experimental excited state data, using a much smaller amount of data than typically required by Machine Learning. We adopt ExROPPP, a fast and spin-pure semiempirical method for calculation of the excited states of radicals, as a surrogate physical model for which we learn the optimal set of parameters. To achieve this we compile the largest known database of organic radical geometries and their UV-vis data, which we use to train our model. Our trained model gives Root Mean Square (RMS) and mean absolute errors for excited state energies of 0.24 and 0.16 eV respectively, improving hugely over ExROPPP with literature parameters. Four new organic radicals are synthesised and we test the model on their spectra, finding even lower errors and similar correlation as for the testing set. This model paves the way for the high throughput discovery of next generation radical-based optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>
