      <title>The Exotic Quasisolidity and Supersolidity of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is ubiquitously important but least known. This perspective features the latest finding of two exotic forms of water called quasisolid and supersolid phases due to the cooperativity and disparity of the O:H-O bond in its segmental length, energy, and specific heat when subjected to thermal, electric, and undercoordination perturbation. The quasisolid (QS) phase only appears at temperatures between melting and ice nucleation, regardless of sample size, and this phase has a negative thermal expansivity (NTE). However, polarization or molecular undercoordination creates the supersolid phase in skins of water and ice, droplets, ionic hydration cells, and volumetric water with a current flow or under a 106 eV/cm electric bias. This phase is characterized by ~10% H-O bond contraction and vibrating at ~3450 cm-1. The supersolid has unique properties such as high elasticity, mechanical strength, optical reflectivity, structure order, thermal stability, diffusivity, catalytic activity, and chemical reactivity. Liquid-QS-Ice transition with QS phase energy absorption occurs for water due to H-O bond contraction during thermal decay but not for the supersolid phase of saturated NaCl solution. The NTE of the QS fosters ice buoyancy and the supersolidity endows ice slipperiness, supercooling, superheating, premelting, low-temperature fiber elasticity, water bridge, and warm water fast cooling, as well as on water chemistry.</description>

      <title>Colossal Seebeck coefficient of thermoelectric material calculated by space charge effect, and phonon drag background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present colossal Seebeck coefficient ($S$) and large thermal electron motivate force (EMF) reproduced by space charge (SC) effect, introducing multi-Debye lengths into grain boundaries (GBs) of thermoelectric (TE) materials with phonon drag (PD) effect. Recently colossal $S$ was reported in several TE materials. In addition, the polarity reversal was also reproduced by transfer process with inner bias around SP generated from thermal EMF. Colossal $S$ and EMF for TE material were reproduced by SC model as the functions of Debye length into GBs, reduced mass: $m^*/m$, and temperature.</description>

      <title>Note:Bridging Information Science: AB Initio Calculation Vortex of 2D Materials of Bismuthene(Bismuth Molecule) Graphene-Shaped through Kohn-Sham Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the intricate electronic and optical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb materials, such as Stannen, arsenene, antimonene, silicene, and bismuthene(bismuth molecule), through the lens of first-principles calculations(AB Initio Calculations) based on the Kohn-Sham equations. Focusing on the exchange-correlation potential approximations within the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, we evaluate the potential of these materials in digital information control and management. Special attention is given to the nonlinear optical responses and electronic properties under the influence of twisted bilayer configurations, external fields, and varying twist angles. The findings offer novel insights into the design of advanced digital devices, suggesting a transformative approach to information technology through the utilization of 2D honeycomb materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Structural and Magnetic Properties of RFeO3 (R=Dy, Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orthoferrites the rare-earth (R) ion has a big impact on structural and magnetic properties in particular the ionic size influences the octahedral tilt and the R3+- Fe3+ interaction modifies properties like the spin reorientation. Growth induced strain in thin films is another means to modify materials properties since the sign of strain affects the bond length and therefore directly the orbital interaction. Our study focuses on epitaxially grown (010) oriented DyFeO3 and LuFeO3 thin films, thereby investigating the impact of compressive lattice strain on the magnetically active Dy3+ and magnetically inactive Lu3+ compared to uniaxially strained single crystal DyFeO3. The DyFeO3 films exhibits a shift of more than 20K in spin-reorientation temperatures, maintain the antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4 phase of the Fe-lattice below the spin reorientation, and show double step hysteresis loops for both in-plane directions between 5 K and 390 K. This is the signature of an Fe-spin induced ferromagnetic Dy3+ lattice above the N\'eel temperature of the Dy. The observed shift in the film spin reorientation temperatures vs lattice strain is in good agreement with isostatic single crystal neutron diffraction experiments with a rate of 2 K/ kbar bar.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of epitaxial Sc1-xVxNy thin films grown on MgO(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of Sc1-xVxNy epitaxial films with different alloying concentrations of V are investigated with respect to effects on thermoelectric properties. Band structure calculations on Sc0.75V0.25N indicate that V 3d states lie in the band gap of the parent ScN compound in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Thus, theoretically the presence of light (dispersive) bands at the {\Gamma}-point with band multiplicity is expected to lead to lower electrical resistivity while flat (heavy) bands at X-W-K symmetry points are associated with higher Seebeck coefficient than that of ScN. With this aim, epitaxial Sc1-xVxNy thin film samples were deposited on MgO(001) substrates. All the samples showed N substoichiometry and pseudocubic crystal structure. The N-vacancy-induced states were visible in the Sc 2p XAS spectra. The reference ScN and Sc1-xVxNy samples up to x = 0.12 were n type, exhibiting carrier concentration of 1021 cm-3, typical for degenerate semiconductors. For the highest V alloying of x = 0.15, holes became the majority charge carrier as indicated by the positive Seebeck coefficient. The underlying electronic structure and bonding mechanism in Sc1-xVxNy influence the electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and Hall effect. Thus, the work contributes to the fundamental understanding of the correlated defects and thermoelectric properties to the electronic structure in Sc-N system with V alloying.</description>

      <title>Wehnelt Photoemission in an Ultrafast Electron Microscope: Stability and Usability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tested and compared the stability and usability of three different cathode materials and configurations in a thermionic-based ultrafast electron microscope: (1) on-axis thermionic and photoemission from a 0.1-mm diameter LaB6 source with graphite guard ring, (2) off-axis photoemission from the Ni aperture surface of the Wehnelt electrode, and (3) on-axis thermionic and photoemission from a 0.2-mm diameter polycrystalline Ta source. For each cathode type and configuration, we illustrate how the photoelectron beam-current stability is deleteriously impacted by simultaneous cooling of the source following thermionic heating. Further, we demonstrate usability via collection of parallel- and convergent-beam electron diffraction patterns and by formation of optimum probe size. We find that usability of the off-axis Ni Wehnelt-aperture photoemission is at least comparable to on-axis LaB6 thermionic emission, as well as to on-axis photoemission. However, the stability and achievable beam currents for off-axis photoemission from the Wehnelt aperture were superior to that of the other cathode types and configurations, regardless of the electron-emission mechanism. Beam-current stability for this configuration was found to be within 1% of the mean for 70 minutes (longest duration tested), and steady-state beam current was reached within the sampling-time resolution used here (~1 s) for 15 pA beam currents (i.e., 460 electrons per packet for a 200 kHz repetition rate). Repeatability and robustness of the steady-state condition was also found to be within 1% of the mean. We discuss the implications of these findings for UEM imaging and diffraction experiments, for pulsed-beam damage measurements, and for practical switching between optimum conventional TEM and UEM operation within the same instrument.</description>

      <title>Accurate determination of thermoelectric figure of merit using ac Harman method with a four-probe configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ac Harman method has been used for the direct estimation of dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) through ac/dc resistance measurements. However, accurate zT estimation with a four-probe configuration is difficult owing to the occurrence of a thermal phase-delay in the heat flow with a low frequency current. This study reports an exact solution for zT estimation by solving the heat conduction equation. The analysis can explain the reverse heat flow, which is the main source of the error in the four-probe configuration, and the experimentally obtained behavior of the frequency dependence of zT of (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$. Approximately 20 % of the error is caused by a thermal phase-delay, unless an appropriate current frequency and voltage-terminal position are chosen. Thus, an accurate zT evaluation using a four-probe configuration at any voltage terminal position is achieved. These findings can lead to interesting thermoelectric metrology and could serve as a powerful tool to search for promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Migration barriers for diffusion of As and P atoms in InP and InAs via vacancies and interstitial atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes of diffusion of As and P atoms in InP and InAs, and atomic and energy structure of group-V vacancies and interstitial P and As atoms in InP and InAs have been investigated using density functional theory. Formation energies of group-V vacancies in InP and InAs and P and As interstitial atoms in InP and InAs have been calculated with hybrid functional. The main types of migration jumps have been determined, and the energy favorable migration paths and migration barriers of As and P atoms diffusion in InP and InAs via vacancies and interstitial atoms have been calculated using climbing image nudged elastic band method. In the case of diffusion of As and P atoms in InP and InAs via interstitial atoms the diffusion process occurs via indirect interstitial mechanism. The migration energy barriers for the vacancy diffusion mechanism are 1.5-2.0 eV, the migration energy barriers for the interstitialcy mechanism are 0.3-0.6 eV. The interstitial atoms have higher formation energies compared to the formation energies of the vacancies, and total activation energies of the diffusion are comparable for the vacancy and interstitialcy mechanisms. The obtained results will be useful for modeling of the diffusion processes in semiconductor structures based on InP and InAs.</description>

      <title>Predicting room-temperature conductivity of Na-ion super ionic conductors with the minimal number of easily-accessible descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the vast compositional possibilities Na$_nM_mM_{m'}$Si$_{3-p-a}$P$_p$As$_a$O$_{12}$, Na-ion superionic conductors (NASICON) are attractive but complicate for designing materials with enhanced room-temperature Na-ion conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$. We propose an explicit regression model for $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$ with easily-accessible descriptors, by exploiting density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD). Initially, we demonstrate that two primary descriptors, the bottleneck width along Na-ion diffusion paths $d_1$ and the average Na-Na distance $\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$, modulate room-temperature Na-ion self-diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm Na,300K}$. Then, we introduce two secondary easily-accessible descriptors: Na-ion content n, which influences $d_1$, $\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$, and Na-ion density $\rho_{\rm Na}$; and the average ionic radius $\langle r_M \rangle$ of metal ions, which impacts $d_1$ and $\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$. These secondary descriptors enable the development of a regression model for $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$ with $n$ and $\langle r_M \rangle$ only. Subsequently, this model identifies a promising yet unexplored stable composition, Na$_{2.75}$Zr$_{1.75}$Nb$_{0.25}$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$, which, upon DFT-MD calculations, indeed exhibits $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K} &gt; 10^{^3}$ S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the adjusted version effectively fits $140$ experimental values with $R^2=0.718$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PCPDTBT nanostructures have been synthesized via template-assisted method and polymer-melt technique. The morphological, optical and structural properties of the PCPDTBT have been investigated. Melting polymer was used as a driving force to infiltrate the Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) template in which the applied temperatures are 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 Celsius respectively. The melting time duration is set constant for 30 minutes for each of those melting temperatures. Nanowires constructions have been produced at all melting temperature however based the morphological investigation, only the first two melting temperatures, 200 and 250, that can serve the structural without any broken noticed on the Raman measurement. The optical and structural properties are also confirm these facts.</description>

      <title>Excitons, Optical Spectra, and Electronic Properties of Semiconducting Hf-based MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting MXenes are an intriguing two-dimensional (2D) material class with promising electronic and optoelectronic properties. Here, we focused on recently prepared Hf-based MXenes, namely Hf$_3$C$_2$O$_2$ and Hf$_2$CO$_2$. Using the first-principles calculation and excited state corrections, we proved its dynamical stability, reconciled its semiconducting behavior, and obtained fundamental gaps by the many-body GW method (indirect 1.1 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively, direct 1.4 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively). Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) we subsequently provided optical gaps (0.9 eV and 2.7eV, respectively), exciton binding energies, absorption spectra, and other properties of excitons in both Hf-based MXenes. The indirect character of both 2D materials further allowed a significant decrease of excitation energies by considering indirect excitons with exciton momentum along the $\Gamma$-M path in the Brillouin zone. The first bright excitons are strongly delocalized in real space while contributed by only a limited number of electron-hole pairs around the M point in the k-space from the valence and conduction band. A diverse range of excitonic states in Hf$_3$C$_2$O$_2$ MXene lead to a 4\% and 13\% absorptance for the first and second peaks in the infrared region of absorption spectra, respectively. In contrast, a prominent 28\% absorptance peak in the visible region appears in Hf$_2$CO$_2$ MXene. Results from radiative lifetime calculations indicate the promising potential of these materials in optoelectric devices requiring sustained and efficient exciton behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-hard C5 with lon topology (lon: Lonsdaleite hexagonal diamond) and characterized by the presence of sp3 and sp2 -like carbon sites is devised from crystal chemistry and used as template matrix structure for identifying original carbonitrides C4N and C2N2 with lon topology except for the equiatomic belonging to a new topology (3,4L147). The steric effect of N(2s2) lone pair is highlighted in C2N2 in inducing an original structure of largely separated two-layered stacking of tetrahedra. The investigations based on crystal chemistry were backed by computations within the quantum density functional theory DFT. All systems were found cohesive and both mechanically (elastic constants) and dynamically (phonons band structures) stable. Super hardness characterizes the carbon allotrope C5 and the nitrides C4N and C2N2. Metallic-like conductivities and insulating characters were identified.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of three-dimensional crack propagation mechanism in the Aluminium alloy AA2024-T3 using high-resolution Digital Image Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue crack growth is usually a three-dimensional problem, but it is often simplified to two dimensions to reduce complexity. However, this study investigates the relationships between microscopic effects such as crack kinking, shear lips, and plasticity that are present in reality. Therefore, crack propagation tests were carried out on 2-mm-thick MT-160 specimens of AA2024-T3 sheet material in L-T and T-L orientation. Using high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC), the plastic zone was identified and measured on the samples surface. The fracture surfaces were then digitized and their 3D shape characterized. Finite element simulations confirm the presence of a local mixed-mode I/II/III state along the crack front for a slant or double shear-fracture type. A derived mapping function enables the determination of the fracture type from the surface plastic zone, along with the current crack tip loading during the test. Finally, a transition of the fracture type also leads to a short-term delay in the crack propagation rate. Based on this information crack propagation curves are computed with regards to the local 3D crack orientation.</description>

      <title>The glassy structure of reactive supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and recycled glass: Contribution of XRD and Raman spectroscopy to their characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares thirteen natural and industrial samples of supplementary or emerging supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs): slag, fly ashes, pozzolan, obsidian, silica fume, and recycled glass. These materials are used or are under consideration for decarbonization in cement plants. XRF, XRD and Raman microspectroscopy were used in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the structural characterization of SCMs. The changes in position and shape of the XRD diffuse halos were compared. Raman spectroscopy was used to study the glass part of the SCM families, to better understand their structure in terms of depolymerization degree, angle, ring size and incorporations into the glass.The chemical composition of each glassy part was also estimated using reverse Bogue calculations. The hump position is correlated with the Raman shift, and with the XRF bulk or with the calculated glass chemical composition of SCMs, in terms of CaO/(SiO2+Al2O3) or network modifiers to formers ratios.</description>

      <title>Determining the chemical composition of diamagnetic mixed solids via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed solid compounds are employed in a vast array of applications so an accurate determination of their chemical compositions is of crucial importance. All current characterization methods require specially-treated samples so the availability of a more practical method with similar accuracy should alleviate the quantification process. In this work, we show how the doping concentration $\delta$ (or isotope concentration) of a mixed solid compound in powdered form, where both parent compounds are diamagnetic, can be obtained from the measurement of the mass magnetization. We exploit the additive nature of the molar magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{Mol}$ and molar mass to construct two equations with the same two unknowns in the $\chi_{Mol}$ vs. $\delta$ space to simultaneously solve $\chi_{Mol}$ and $\delta$ of a mixed solid. Eight examples are provided to show the wide applicability of this method: NH$_{4(1-\delta)}$D$_{4\delta}$Br (where D = $^2$H), NH$_4$I$_{1-\delta}$Br$_\delta$, (NH$_4$H$_2$)$_{1-\delta}$(ND$_4$D$_2$)$_\delta$PO$_4$, C$_{48}$H$_{22+6\delta}$Br$_{6(1-\delta)}$O$_{32}$Zr$_6$, [creatine]$_{1-\delta}$[$_D$-glucose]$_\delta$, [$_L$-glutamic acid]$_{1-\delta}$[$_L$-leucine]$_\delta$, [terephthalic acid]$_{1-\delta}$[trimesic acid]$_\delta$ and [p-terphenyl]$_{1-\delta}$[triphenylphosphine]$_\delta$. Experimental errors of ~1.2% were obtained for $\delta$ from average sample masses of 16.6 mg in powdered form rendering the presented approach an attractive choice for characterizing the ratios of mixed solids.</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin polarization in lightly Cr-substituted layered antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>

Abstract: Tuning magnetic properties in layered magnets is an important route to realize novel phenomenon related to two-dimensional (2D) magnetism. Recently, tuning antiferromagnetic (AFM) properties through substitution and intercalation techniques have been widely studied in MPX3 compounds. Interesting phenomena, such as diverse AFM structures and even the signatures of ferrimagnetism, have been reported. However, long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the magnetic properties of the previously unreported Cr-substituted NiPS3. We found that Cr substitution is extremely efficient in controlling spin orientation in NiPS3. Our study reveals a field-induced spin polarization in lightly (9%) Cr-substituted NiPS3, which is likely attributed to the attenuation of AFM interactions and magnetic anisotropy due to Cr doping. Our work provides a possible strategy to achieve FM phase in AFM MPX3, which could be useful for investigating 2D magnetism as well as potential device applications.</description>

      <title>Are large language models superhuman chemists?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained. This is relevant for the chemical sciences, which face the problem of small and diverse datasets that are frequently in the form of text. LLMs have shown promise in addressing these issues and are increasingly being harnessed to predict chemical properties, optimize reactions, and even design and conduct experiments autonomously. However, we still have only a very limited systematic understanding of the chemical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harms. Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework designed to rigorously evaluate the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of human chemists. We curated more than 7,000 question-answer pairs for a wide array of subfields of the chemical sciences, evaluated leading open and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average. The models, however, struggle with some chemical reasoning tasks that are easy for human experts and provide overconfident, misleading predictions, such as about chemicals' safety profiles. These findings underscore the dual reality that, although LLMs demonstrate remarkable proficiency in chemical tasks, further research is critical to enhancing their safety and utility in chemical sciences. Our findings also indicate a need for adaptations to chemistry curricula and highlight the importance of continuing to develop evaluation frameworks to improve safe and useful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of triangular-lattice transition-metal phosphates</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of the spin supersolid candidate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ stimulates numerous research interest on the triangular-lattice transition-metal phosphates. Here we report a comprehensive study on the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of polycrystalline Na$_2$$A$$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ ($A$ = Ba, Sr; $T$ = Co, Ni, Mn). X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements confirm that Na$_2$Ba$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NB$T$P) crystallizes in a trigonal structure, while Na$_2$Sr$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NS$T$P) forms a monoclinic structure with a slight distortion of the triangular network of $T^{2+}$ ions. The dc magnetization data show that all six compounds order antiferromagnetically below 2 K, and the N\'{e}el temperatures of NS$T$P are consistently higher than those of NB$T$P for $T$ = Co, Ni, and Mn, due to the release of geometrical frustration by monoclinic distortions. Further magnetocaloric measurements show that trigonal NB$T$P can reach a lower temperature in the quasi-adiabatic demagnetization process and thus shows a better performance in the magnetic refrigeration, compared with monoclinic NS$T$P. Our findings highlight the outstanding magnetocaloric performances of the trigonal transition-metal phosphates, and disclose two necessary ingredients for a superior magnetic coolant that can reach an ultra-low temperature, including a perfect geometrically frustrated lattice and a small effective spin number associated with the magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>C-type antiferromagnetic structure of topological semimetal CaMnSb$_2$</title>

Abstract: Determination of the magnetic structure and confirmation of the presence or absence of inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is imperative for correctly understanding the topological magnetic materials. Here high-quality single crystals of the layered manganese pnictide CaMnSb$_2$ are synthesized using the self-flux method. De Haas-van Alphen oscillations indicate a nontrivial Berry phase of $\sim$ $\pi$ and a notably small cyclotron effective mass, supporting the Dirac semimetal nature of CaMnSb$_2$. Neutron diffraction measurements identify a C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure below $T\rm_{N}$ = 303(1) K with the Mn moments aligned along the $a$ axis, which is well supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The corresponding magnetic space group is $Pn'm'a'$, preserving a $\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Adopting the experimentally determined magnetic structure, band crossings near the Y point in momentum space and linear dispersions of the Sb $5p_{y,z}$ bands are revealed by the DFT calculations. Furthermore, our study predicts the possible existence of an intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect in CaMnSb$_2$, offering a promising platform to study the impact of topological properties on nonlinear electrical transports in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Understanding spin currents from magnon dispersion and polarization: Spin-Seebeck effect and neutron scattering study on Tb3Fe5O12</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon spin currents in the ferrimagnetic garnet Tb3Fe5O12 with 4f electrons were examined through the spin-Seebeck effect and neutron scattering measurements. The compound shows a magnetic compensation, where the spin-Seebeck signal reverses above and below Tcomp = 249.5(4) K. Unpolarized neutron scattering unveils two major magnon branches with finite energy gaps, which are well-explained in the framework of spin-wave theory. Their temperature dependencies and the direction of the precession motion of magnetic moments, i.e. magnon polarization, defined using polarized neutrons, explain the reversal at Tcomp and decay of the spin-Seebeck signals at low temperatures. We illustrate an example that momentum- and energy-resolved microscopic information is a prerequisite to understanding the magnon spin current.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells</title>

Abstract: We present an experimental study on optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells near the crossover between $\varGamma$- and $X$-valley confined electron states. The time-integrated photoluminescence experiment at $T=$4.8 K revealed three simultaneously observed optical transitions resulting from (a) a direct exciton recombination, involving an electron and a hole states both located in the $\varGamma$-valley in the quantum well layer, and (b) two spatially and momentum indirect excitons, comprising of the confined electron states in the $X$-valley in the AlAs barrier with different effective masses and quantum well holes in the $\varGamma$-valley. The measured spatial extent, density dependence and temperature dependence of the structure photoluminescence revealed characteristics necessary to pinpoint the states' nature and provided their characterization crucial in future device design. Temporal dynamics observed in the time-resolved photoluminescence measurement showed the complexity of the capture and recombination dynamics, largely affected by nonradiative processes, what is additionally critical in the system's use. This solid state platform hosting both direct and indirect excitons in a highly tunable monolithic system can benefit and underline the operation principles of novel electronic and photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical force is an essential feature for many physical and biological processes.1-12 Remote measurement of mechanical signals with high sensitivity and spatial resolution is needed for diverse applications, including robotics,13 biophysics,14-20 energy storage,21-24 and medicine.25-27 Nanoscale luminescent force sensors excel at measuring piconewton forces,28-32 while larger sensors have proven powerful in probing micronewton forces.33,34 However, large gaps remain in the force magnitudes that can be probed remotely from subsurface or interfacial sites, and no individual, non-invasive sensor is capable of measuring over the large dynamic range needed to understand many systems.35,36 Here, we demonstrate Tm3+-doped avalanching nanoparticle37 force sensors that can be addressed remotely by deeply penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and can detect piconewton to micronewton forces with a dynamic range spanning more than four orders of magnitude. Using atomic force microscopy coupled with single-nanoparticle optical spectroscopy, we characterize the mechanical sensitivity of the photon avalanching process and reveal its exceptional force responsiveness. By manipulating the Tm3+ concentrations and energy transfer within the nanosensors, we demonstrate different optical force-sensing modalities, including mechanobrightening and mechanochromism. The adaptability of these nanoscale optical force sensors, along with their multiscale sensing capability, enable operation in the dynamic and versatile environments present in real-world, complex structures spanning biological organisms to nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).</description>

Abstract: We present a simple route to obtain large quantities of suspensions of non-Brownian particles with stimuli-responsive surface properties to study the relation between their flow and interparticle inter- actions. We perform an alkaline hydrolysis reaction on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles to obtain poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMAA-Na) particles. We characterize the quasi-static macro- scopic frictional response of their aqueous suspensions using a rotating drum. The suspensions are frictionless when the particles are dispersed in pure water. We relate this state to the presence of elec- trosteric repulsion between the charged surfaces of the ionized PMAA-Na particles in water. Then we add monovalent and multivalent ions (Na+, Ca2+, La3+) and we observe that the suspensions become frictional whatever the valency. For divalent and trivalent ions, the quasi-static avalanche angle {\theta}c at large ionic strength is greater than that of frictional PMMA particles in water, suggest- ing the presence of adhesion. Finally, a decrease in the pH of the suspending solution leads to a transition between a frictionless plateau and a frictional one. We perform Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to relate our macroscopic observations to the surface features of the particles. In particular, we show that the increase in friction in the presence of multivalent ions or under acidic conditions is driven by a nanoscopic phase separation and the bundling of polyelectrolyte chains at the surface of the particle. Our results highlight the importance of surface interactions in the rheology of gran- ular suspensions. Our particles provide a simple, yet flexible platform to study frictional suspension flows.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Without External Magnetic Fields from Individual CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract: Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), the latest generation of colloidal QD family, exhibit outstanding optical properties which are now exploited as both classical and quantum light sources. Most of their rather exceptional properties are related to the peculiar exciton fine-structure of band-edge states which can support unique bright triplet excitons. The degeneracy of the bright triplet excitons is lifted with energetic splitting in the order of millielectronvolts, which can be resolved by the photoluminescence (PL) measurements of single QDs at cryogenic temperatures. Each bright exciton fine-structure-state (FSS) exhibits a dominantly linear polarization, in line with several theoretical models based on the sole crystal field, exchange interaction and shape anisotropy. Here, we show that in addition to a high degree of linear polarization, the individual exciton FSS can exhibit a non-negligible degree of circular polarization even without external magnetic fields by investigating the four Stokes parameters of the exciton fine-structure in individual CsPbBr3 QDs through Stokes polarimetric measurements. We observe a degree of circular polarization up to ~38%, which could not be detected by using the conventional polarimetric technique. In addition, we found a consistent transition from left- to right-hand circular polarization within the fine-structure triplet manifold, which was observed in magnetic field dependent experiments. Our optical investigation provides deeper insights into the nature of the exciton fine-structures and thereby drives the yet-incomplete understanding of the unique photophysical properties of this novel class of QDs, potentially opening new scenarios in chiral quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding plastic deformation of crystals in terms of the fundamental physics of dislocations has remained a grand challenge in materials science for decades. To overcome this, the Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) method has been developed, but its lack of atomistic resolution leaves open the possibility that certain key mechanisms may be overlooked. By comparing large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) with DDD simulations performed under identical conditions we uncover significant discrepancies in the predicted strength and microstructure evolution in BCC crytals under high-strain rate conditions. These are traced to unexpected behaviors of dislocation network nodes forming at dislocation intersections, that can move in ways not previously anticipated as revealed by MD. Once these newfound freedoms of nodal motion are incorporated, DDD simulations begin to closely match plastic evolution observed in MD. This additional mechanism of motion whereby non-screw dislocations can change their glide plane profoundly affects fundamental processes of dislocation multiplication, recovery and storage that define strength of metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new cage-structured compound - HfMn$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ - belonging to the AB$_{2}$C$_{20}$ (A, B = transition or rare earth metals, and C = Al, Zn, or Cd) family of structures has been synthesized via the self-flux method. The new compound crystallizes in the space group Fd-3m with lattice parameter a = 14.0543(2) \r{A} (Z = 8) and exhibits non-stoichiometry due to Mn/Zn mixing on the Mn-site and an underoccupied Hf-site. The structure refines to Hf$_{0.93}$Mn$_{1.63}$Zn$_{20.37}$ and follows lattice size trends when compared to other HfM$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) structures. The magnetic measurements show that this compound displays a modified Curie-Weiss behavior with a transition temperature around 22 K. The magnetization shows no saturation, a small magnetic moment, and near negligible hysteresis, all signs of the itinerant magnetism. The Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio and the spin fluctuation parameters ratio both confirm the itinerant nature of the magnetism in HfMn$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$.</description>

      <title>Double glass transition in polyethylene naphthalate structural relaxation by MDSC, BDS and TSDC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental study of the primary and secondary relaxations of the semi-crystalline polymer polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC) and Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS), and how they are affected by physical aging. Three dipolar relaxation modes can be observed: (from slowest to fastest) the primary $\alpha$ relaxation, which vitrifies at the glass transition temperature, $T_{g\alpha}$, and two secondary relaxations, named $\beta^*$ and $\beta$. MDSC results show how the secondary $\beta^*$ relaxation also vitrifies, giving rise to an additional glass transition at $T_{g\beta^*} &lt; T_{g\alpha}$. In fact, the $\alpha$ and $\beta^*$ relaxations can be considered as part of a very broad and distributed relaxation. Its main part is the primary $\alpha$ relaxation with a shoulder at the high-frequency region corresponding to a complex secondary $\beta^*$ relaxation. BDS results about the $\beta^*$ can be modeled by a main contribution ($\beta_3^*$) and two additional ones ($\beta_1^*$ and $\beta_2^*$) with a weaker dielectric strength. TSDC results show that each single mode of the relaxation has its own glass transition temperature and they are compatible with the structure inferred by BDS. This scenario gives rise to an extended glass transition dually centered in the $T_{g\beta^*} \sim 305$ K and $T_{g\alpha} \sim 387$ K. temperatures.</description>

      <title>Effects of strain-tunable valleys on charge transport in bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05285</link>

Abstract: The manipulation of the valley degree of freedom can boost the technological development of novel functional devices based on valleytronics. The current mainstream platform for valleytronics is to produce a monolayer with inversion asymmetry, in which the strain-band engineering through the substrates can serve to improve the performance of valley-based devices. However, pinpointing the effective role of strain is inevitable for the precise design of the desired valley structure. Here, we demonstrate the charge transport under continuously controllable external strain for bulk bismuth crystals with three equivalent electron valleys and one hole valley. The strain response of resistance, namely elastoresistance, exhibits the evolutions in both antisymmetric and symmetric channels with decreasing temperature. The elastoresistance behaviors mainly reflect the significant changes in valley density depending on the symmetry of induced strain, evidenced by our strain-dependent quantum oscillation measurements and first-principle band calculations under strain. These facts suggest the successful tune and evaluation of the valley populations through strain-dependent charge valley transport.</description>

      <title>Optimally Localized Wannier Functions for 2D Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of optimally localized Wannier functions (and Wannier functions in general) for a Chern insulator has been considered to be impossible owing to the fact that the second moment of such functions is generally infinite. In this manuscript, we propose a solution to this problem in the case of a single band. We accomplish this by drawing an analogy between the minimization of the variance and the minimization of the electrostatic energy of a periodic array of point charges in a smooth neutralizing background. In doing so, we obtain a natural regularization of the diverging variance and this leads to an analytical solution to the minimization problem. We demonstrate our results numerically for a particular model system. Furthermore, we show how the optimally localized Wannier functions provide a natural way of evaluating the electric polarization for a Chern insulator.</description>

      <title>Lattice fluctuations, not excitonic correlations, mediated electronic localization in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ is thought to be an insulator with a bandgap of ~0.1eV. It has attracted a much interest because, among of a rich array of unique properties, many have thought TiSe$_2$ is a rare realisation of an excitonic insulator. Below 200 K, TiSe$_2$ undergoes a transition from a high-symmetry ({P-3m1}) phase to a low-symmetry ({P-3c1}) phase. Here we establish that TiSe$_2$ is indeed an insulator in both {P-3m1} and {P-3c1} phases. However, the insulating state is driven not by excitonic effects but by symmetry-breaking of the {P-3m1} phase. In the CDW phase the symmetry breaking is static. At high temperature, thermally driven instantaneous deviations from {P-3m1} break the symmetry on the characteristic time scale of a phonon. Even while the time-averaged \emph{lattice} structure assumes {P-3m1} symmetry, the time-averaged \emph{energy band} structure is closer to the CDW phase -- a rare instance of a metal-insulator transition induced by dynamical symmetry breaking. We establish these conclusions from a high-fidelity, self-consistent form of many body perturbation theory, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to capture the effects of thermal disorder. The many-body theory includes explicitly ladder diagrams in the polarizability, which incorporates excitonic effects in an \emph{ab initio} manner. The excitonic modification to the potential is slight, ruling out the possibility that TiSe$_2$ is an excitonic insulator. Charge self-consistency is essential distinguish the metallic from insulating state.</description>

      <title>Vibrational properties differ between halide and chalcogenide perovskite semiconductors, and it matters for optoelectronic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a comparative study of temperature-dependent photoluminescence and structural dynamics of two perovskite semiconductors, the chalcogenide BaZrS$_3$ (BZS) and the halide CsPbBr$_3$ (CPB). These materials have similar crystal structures and direct band gaps, but we find that they have quite distinct optoelectronic and vibrational properties. Both materials exhibit thermally-activated non-radiative recombination, but the non-radiative recombination rate in BZS is between two and four orders of magnitude faster than in CPB. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the effects of phonon anharmonicity are far more pronounced in CPB than in BZS. Further, although both materials feature a large dielectric response due to low-energy polar optical phonons, the phonons in CPB are substantially lower in energy than in BZS. Our results suggest that electron-phonon coupling in BZS is more effective at non-radiative recombination than in CPB, and that BZS may also have a substantially higher concentration of non-radiative recombination centers than CPB. The low defect concentration in CPB may be related to the ease of lattice reconfiguration, typified by anharmonic bonding. It remains to be seen to what extent these differences are inherent to the chalcogenide and halide perovskites and to what extent they can be affected by materials processing; comparing BZS single-crystals and thin films provides reason for optimism.</description>

      <title>Band mixing in the quantum anomalous Hall regime of twisted semiconductor bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkable recent experiments have observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects at zero field and unusually high temperatures in twisted semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$. Intriguing observations in these experiments such as the absence of integer Hall effects at twist angles where a fractional Hall effect is observed, do however remain unexplained. The experimental phase diagram as a function of twist angle remains to be established. By comprehensive numerical study, we show that band mixing has large qualitative and quantitative effects on the energetics of competing states and their energy gaps throughout the twist angle range $\theta\leq 4^\circ$. This lays the ground for the detailed realistic study of a rich variety of strongly correlated twisted semiconductor multilayers and an understanding of the phase diagram of these fascinating systems.</description>

      <title>Electric Fields Near Undulating Dielectric Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric interfaces are crucial to the behavior of charged membranes, from graphene to synthetic and biological lipid bilayers. Understanding electrolyte behavior near these interfaces remains a challenge, especially in the case of rough dielectric surfaces. A lack of analytical solutions consigns this problem to numerical treatments. We report an analytic method for determining electrostatic potentials near curved dielectric membranes in a two-dimensional periodic 'slab' geometry using a periodic summation of Green's functions. This method is amenable to simulating arbitrary groups of charges near surfaces with two-dimensional deformations. We concentrate on one-dimensional undulations. We show that increasing membrane undulation increases the asymmetry of interfacial charge distributions due to preferential ionic repulsion from troughs. In the limit of thick membranes we recover results mimicking those for electrolytes near a single interface. Our work demonstrates that rough surfaces generate charge patterns in electrolytes of charged molecules or mixed-valence ions.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area-Grown PbTe-Pb Planar Josephson Junctions for Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are predicted to host Majorana zero modes. The material platforms in previous studies are two dimensional electron gases (InAs, InSb, InAsSb and HgTe) coupled to a superconductor such as Al or Nb. Here, we introduce a new material platform for planar JJs, the PbTe-Pb hybrid. The semiconductor, PbTe, was grown as a thin film via selective area epitaxy. The Josephson junction was defined by a shadow wall during the deposition of the superconductor Pb. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a sharp semiconductor-superconductor interface. Gate-tunable supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections are observed. A perpendicular magnetic field causes interference patterns of the switching current, exhibiting Fraunhofer-like and SQUID-like behaviors. We further demonstrate a prototype device for Majorana detection, wherein phase bias and tunneling spectroscopy are applicable.</description>

      <title>Spin ice evidence in the frustrated Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds have exhibited spin ice behavior. These compounds have not been adequately reported based on the concept of magnetic frustration. Here, we have synthesized and characterized Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 to study the ground state magnetic properties. We confirmed the cubic pyrochlore structure via X-ray powder diffraction. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements show an absence of magnetic order down to 400 mK. Interestingly, the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity exhibited a broad maximum around Tmax = 0.9 K for Gd2GaSbO7 and Tmax = 1 K for Gd2InSbO7, suggesting the presence of spin fluctuations and following the T^1.71 and T^1.49 dependence for Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 respectively. We scale the ratio between nearest-neighbour exchange and dipolar interaction of all the reported Gd-based pyrochlores, where Gd2InSbO7 has the lowest and weaker exchange interaction of all among others. It states that chemical pressure has an impact on exchange interaction due to the different pathways of mediators between magnetic ions. This study reveals the robust spin ice behaviour in the ground state like Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7. It is in stark contrast with other Gd-Pyrochlore compounds that hold the long-range magnetic order.</description>
