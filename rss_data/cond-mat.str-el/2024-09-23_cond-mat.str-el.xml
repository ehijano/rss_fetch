      <title>Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been recently observed at multiple fractional fillings of the moir\'e unit cell [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for an accurate microscopic description of these materials, we explore the theoretical origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the limitations of theoretical descriptions of these moir\'e GWCs relying on truncated (finite-range) electron-electron interactions instead of a long-range Coulomb interaction. We validate our findings by studying both classical and quantum mechanical effects at zero and finite temperatures. More generally, we discuss the role of charge frustration in the theoretical extended Hubbard-model phase diagram, identifying a "pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted generalized Wigner crystal with coexisting solid and liquid-like features, with no classical analog. Quantum effects also explain the small, but experimentally detectable, asymmetry in the transition temperatures of the $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ crystals. Our calculations reveal that the charge ordering temperature and the magnetic crossover temperature predicted using the long-range Coulomb interaction are correctly captured with appropriately renormalized nearest-neighbor interactions. The effective nearest-neighbor interaction strength is significantly weaker than previously reported, placing it close to a metal-insulator phase boundary. This observation has implications for future experiments that we discuss. We conclude by studying the dependence of melting temperatures on gate-to-sample separation and we also predict temperature scales at which magnetic crossovers should be observed.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric and Multiferroic Properties of Quasi-2D Organic Charge-Transfer Salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional ferroelectrics the electric dipoles are generated by off-center displacements of ions. In recent years, a new type of so-called electronic ferroelectrics has attracted great attention, where the polarization is driven by electronic degrees of freedom. Of particular interest are materials with strong electronic correlations, featuring a variety of intriguing phenomena and instabilities, which may interact with or even induce electronic ferroelectricity. In this review, we will focus on the class of strongly correlated charge-transfer salts, where electronic ferroelectricity was suggested by theory and has been confirmed by numerous experiments. The paper summarizes some basic physical properties of various relevant quasi-two dimensional salts and gives some background on the experimental tools applied to establish ferroelectricity. We discuss the key experimental observations, including the exciting discovery of multiferroicity, and provide some theoretical considerations on the magnetoelectric couplings that are of relevance here.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression to 4.2~GPa leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.25~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of $5.5-6.0$~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3\simeq 0.1$\,meV distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</description>

      <title>Effects of phonon dispersion on the bond-bipolaron superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method based on lattice path-integral representaion of the particle sector and real-space diagrammatics of the phonon sector to study effects of optical phonon dispersion on Bose-Einstein condensation of bipolarons in the bond model. For dispersionless phonons with frequency $\omega$ this model was recently shown to give rise to small-size, light-mass bipolarons that undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the $T_c/\omega$ ratio. We find that for dispersive phonons, $T_c$ remains relatively high over a broader range of the coupling strength and even keeps increasing in the deep adiabatic regime both in two and three dimensions. This result implies that phonon dispersion is not a limiting factor in the search for new materials with high superconducting temperatures.</description>

      <title>The magnetic $Z_2$ topological insulator on the AA-stacked bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties displayed by graphene at van Hove singularities (VHS) have caught significant attention in recent years. The emergence of exotic quantum states at these singularities prompts investigations on their evolution within the realm of multilayer stacking structures. In our research, we delve into the study of a repulsive Hubbard model focusing on the AA-stacked bilayer graphene at VHS. Within the system's ground state, each of the top and bottom layers hosts a set of spin-density waves (SDWs). These SDWs each takes on three mutually perpendicular spin polarization directions. Importantly, there is noteworthy feature that their spin polarization directions in the two layers exist as elegant embodiments of antiferromagnetic arrangement, persvading the structure with a striking pattern. Referred to in prior research as the chiral SDWs, this intralayer density wave structure confers the system the characteristics of a Chern topological insulator. However, what is particularly fascinating is the pure divergence of the bilayer structure's topological traits when compared to its monolayer counterpart. The system exhibits a profound symmetry known as $Z_2$, preserving its invariance under the combined operations of time-reversal and interlayer exchange. Consequentely, the system's ground state manifests a seemingly trivial Chern number, yet harbors a profound and intricate nontrivial $Z_2$ topological invariant. These remarkable observations align our findings with the conceptual framework of the quantum spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</description>

      <title>Signature of preformed pairs in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and variational exact diagonalization (VED) to calculate the single-electron removal spectral weight for the Hubbard-Holstein model at low electron densities. Tuning the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and of the Hubbard repulsion allows us to contrast the results for a liquid of polarons versus a liquid of bipolarons. The former shows spectral weight up to the Fermi energy, as expected for a (uncorrelated) metal. The latter has a gap in its spectral weight, set by the bipolaron binding energy, although this is also a (strongly correlated) metal. This difference suggests that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy could be used to identify liquids of pre-formed pairs. Furthermore, we show that the liquid of bipolarons is well approximated by an ensemble of bosons that are hard-core in momentum space, filling the states inside the Fermi sea but otherwise non-interacting. This new proposal for a strongly correlated many-body wavefunction opens the way for studying various other properties of liquids of pre-formed pairs.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field studies of Wigner crystal transitions in various interacting two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study Wigner crystal (WC) transitions in various interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) models, including both conventional 2DEG model and ``$n$-order" Dirac fermion models with energy-momentum dispersion $E_{\mathbf{k}} \sim k^n$, with $n$ being positive integer. A general ``$GW$+RPA" framework to treat single-particle spectra and ground-state energies in 2D systems has been developed. Within such a framework, we first calculate the single-particle excitation spectra of a conventional 2DEG system with $GW$ approximation for both Wigner-crystal state and Fermi-liquid (FL) state, in which the frequency dependent dielectric function is treated using a multiple-plasma-pole approach. Then, the correlation energy with random phase approximation (RPA) is further calculated based on the $GW$ single-particle spectra. By comparing the total energies of WC and FL states, our $GW$+RPA approach gives a critical Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s^*\sim 19.2$ for the WC transition in conventional 2DEG system.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagrams of Dicke-Ising models by a wormhole algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Waves and the Effects of Uniaxial Strain on the Electronic Structure of 2H-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay of superconductivity and density wave orders has been at the forefront of research of correlated electronic phases for a long time. 2H-NbSe$_2$ is considered to be a prototype system for studying this interplay, where the balance between the two orders was proven to be sensitive to band filling and pressure. However, the origin of charge density wave in this material is still unresolved. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we revisit the charge density wave order and study the effects of uniaxial strain on the electronic structure of 2H-NbSe$_2$. Our results indicate previously undetected signatures of charge density waves on the Fermi surface. The application of small amount of uniaxial strain induces substantial changes in the electronic structure and lowers its symmetry. This, and the altered lattice should affect both the charge density wave phase and superconductivity and should be observable in the macroscopic properties.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial is a pedagogical introduction to recent methods of computing quantum spin entanglement witnesses from spectroscopy, with a special focus on neutron scattering on quantum spin systems. We offer a brief introduction to the concepts and equations, define a data analysis protocol, and discuss the interpretation of three entanglement witnesses: one-tangle, two-tangle, and Quantum Fisher Information. We also discuss practical experimental considerations, and give three examples of extracting entanglement witnesses from experimental data: Copper Nitrate, KCuF3, and NiPS3.</description>

      <title>Tuning competition between charge order and superconductivity in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a flurry of works have found strong competition between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) in the doped Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice. Interestingly, some recent results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this work, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and antiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective $t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term that contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To explore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we implement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\it six-leg} cylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts partially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases, the increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order, consistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the partially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead, the system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a filled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the partially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be tuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings may strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to play more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dephasing, Entanglement and Exchange-Only Toffoli Gate Sequence in Quantum Dot Spin Chains</title>

Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the average size of Cooper pairs using mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report here the structural, micro-structural/morphological and detailed magnetic properties of RECrO3 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) Orthocromites. A series of RECrO3 (RE = La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) Orthocromites polycrystalline samples with uniform particle size were synthesized via standard solid-state reaction method. LaCrO3 (LCO), NdCrO3 (NCO), SmCrO3(SCO), and EuCrO3 (ECO) crystallizes in single phase of orthorhombic structure with Pnma (No.62) space group while GdCrO3 (GCO) found to crystallize in orthorhombic phase with Pbnm space group. SEM images confirms the systematic growth of all studied samples grain growth takes place during the sintering process and images shows the polyhedral shape with varying average grain size ranging from approximately 1.0{\mu}m to 3{\mu}m confirm the bulk synthesis of studied RECrO3. Lowest average grain size (~ 1.1{\mu}m) was observed for LaCrO3 and maximum (~ 2.8{\mu}m) for EuCrO3. The shapes of the grain size changes because of crystal lattice distortion induced by various rare earths (La, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) at A site. Energy dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) reveals the elements confirmation in different studied RECrO3 samples. Within the detection limit of EDAX no impurity elements were observed in different as synthesized RECrO3 samples. Temperature dependent DC magnetization (M-T) studies showed an antiferromagnetic transition (TN) attributed to Cr3+ spins in all samples at different temperature. At low temperature spin-reorientation (TSR) of rare earth ion was also observed in NCO, SCO at around 50K and the same is observed at around 30K in ECO and the same was missing in GCO because of large moment of Gd3+ ions attributed by ground state spectroscopic term 8S7/2 by external applied magnetic field. The magnetization versus applied magnetic field (M-H) loops exhibited ferromagnetic like behavior at 10K and 100K and paramagnetic at 300K for GCO.</description>

      <title>Making s-wave superconductors topological with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an s-wave superconductor may become topological in the presence of a magnetic field which leads to formation of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. Below the upper critical field, a new superconducting state with a nontrivial topological number emerges, which we call Abrikosov-Chern superconducting state. Deeper in the superconducting domain, the topological number changes in steps, eventually reaching zero. Our theory uncovers the nature of evolution from an integer quantum Hall state having a cyclotron gap above the upper critical field to the topologically-trivial s-wave superconductor carrying finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels at low field. Topological transitions manifest as changes in the number of edge modes, detectable through tunneling microscopy and thermal transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</description>

      <title>A simple model for strange metallic behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A refined semi-holographic non-Fermi liquid model, in which carrier electrons hybridize with operators of a holographic critical sector, has been proposed recently for strange metallic behavior. The model, consistently with effective theory approach, has two couplings whose ratio is related to the doping. We explain the origin of the linear-in-T resistivity and strange metallic behavior as a consequence of the emergence of a universal form of the spectral function which is independent of the model parameters when the ratio of the two couplings take optimal values determined only by the critical exponent. This universal form fits well with photoemission data of copper oxide samples for under/optimal/over-doping with a fixed exponent over a wide range of temperatures. We further obtain a refined Planckian dissipation scenario in which the scattering time $\tau = f \cdot \hbar /(k_B T)$, with $f$ being $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at strong coupling, but $\mathcal{O}(10)$ at weak coupling.</description>

      <title>Exploring possible magnetic monopoles-induced magneto-electricity in spin ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibilities of combining several degrees of freedom inside a unique material have recently been highlighted in their dynamics and proposed as information carriers in quantum devices where their cross-manipulation by external parameters such as electric and magnetic fields could enhance their functionalities. An emblematic example is that of electromagnons, spin-waves dressed with electric dipoles, that are fingerprints of multiferroics. Point-like objects have also been identified, which may take the form of excited quasiparticles. This is the case for magnetic monopoles, the exotic excitations of spin ices, that have been recently proposed to carry an electric dipole although experimental evidences remain elusive. Presently, we investigate the electrical signature of a classical spin ice and a related compound that supports quantum fluctuations. Our in-depth study clearly attributes magnetoelectricity to the correlated spin ice phase distinguishing it from extrinsic and single-ion effects. Our calculations show that the proposed model conferring magnetoelectricity to monopoles is not sufficient, calling for higher order contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of parity and time-reversal symmetries, insulators can exhibit magnetoelectric responses, in which applied magnetic fields induce charge polarization and, conversely, applied electric fields induce magnetization. While there is a long history of the study of magnetoelectric response in fermionic insulators, the same for bosonic insulators has been limited. We consider the magnetoelectric response in lattice insulators built out of charged bosonic degrees of freedom and derive a bulk formula for the corresponding linear response tensor. The resulting formulae feature several contributions including a Chern-Simons integral over the bands of the bosonic excitations. We construct several minimal microscopic models that illustrate the ingredients required to obtain a sizable bosonic magnetoelectric response. Our formalism can be applied to bosonic Mott insulators subject to synthetic gauge fields and/or tilted potentials as well as to the spinon sector in the Coulomb phase of a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear in large families of gapless states of quantum matter and constrain their low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Attractive Interaction in Spin Spectra of One-dimensional Cuprate Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the minimal model for cuprates is crucial for explaining the high-$T_c$ pairing mechanism. Recent photoemission experiments have suggested a significant near-neighbor attractive interaction $V$ in cuprate chains, favoring pairing instability. To determine its strength, we systematically investigate the dynamical spin structure factors $S(q,\omega)$ using the density matrix renormalization group. Our analysis quantitatively reveals a notable softening in the two-spinon continuum, particularly evident in the intense spectrum at large momentum. This softening is primarily driven by the renormalization of the superexchange interaction, as determined by a comparison with the slave-boson theory. We also demonstrate the feasibility of detecting this spectral shift in thin-film samples using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Therefore, this provides a distinctive fingerprint for the attractive interaction, motivating future experiments to unveil essential ingredients in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides are a new platform for realizing strongly correlated physics with high tunability. Recent transport experiments [A. Ghiotto et al. Nature 597, 345 (2021)] have reported the bandwidth-driven evolution of a Mott insulator to a strange metal behavior via the tuning of a displacement field in twisted $\mathrm{WSe_2}$ fixed at half filling. However, the nature of the correlated states and the related Mott physics involved in the whole process remain to be determined. Here, we unveil theoretically the evolution of the ground state of the half-filled $\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}$ Hubbard model as applied to $\mathrm{tWSe_2}$, transiting from a pseudogap state with Fermi arcs to a $120^\circ$ Ne$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$l ordered Mott insulator, then to another pseudogap state with Fermi pockets, and eventually to a Fermi liquid via a Lifshitz transition. The pseudogap phases are definitely identified by the vanishing of quasiparticle weights over parts of the Fermi surface, with the remaining parts forming disconnected Fermi arcs or pockets with well-defined quasiparticles. We demonstrate that the Fermi arc/pocket results from the electronic band structure reconstruction driven by electron correlations, marked by the coexistence of the poles and zeros of the single-particle Green's function. This work reveals the fundamental aspects of the Mottness in $\mathrm{moir\acute{e}}$ system and will stimulate the direct probes of the underling physice beyond transports via the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum circuits constructed from $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX+YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX+YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving 2-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost of realizing quantum processes</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a peculiar connection between particles, underpins powerful technologies such as quantum computing and secure communication. However, quantifying the minimum entanglement required to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes remains a significant challenge. We develop an efficiently computable tool that reliably estimates the amount of entanglement needed for realizing arbitrary quantum processes respecting certain physical principles. Our tool applies to the entanglement required to prepare a broad range of quantum states in the asymptotic regime, surpassing previous methods' limitations. We also confirm that entanglement, once consumed to realize the considered class of quantum operations, cannot be fully recovered, even asymptotically. This irreversible behavior is evident for full-rank entangled states and practically relevant amplitude damping channels, even under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose. We showcase our approach's power through examples such as estimating entanglement requirements for realizing bipartite dephasing SWAP channels and solving Hamiltonian simulations under thermal interaction, highlighting its advantages over existing techniques. Our work provides a practical toolkit for benchmarking entanglement requirements for generic states and quantum dynamics, paving the way for assessing and optimizing the performances of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum frustrated Wigner chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Fractional Topological Charges in 2D Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are characterised by an integer topological charge $\mathcal Q =\mp 1$, describing the winding of the magnetic orientation. Half-integer winding numbers, $\mathcal Q=\pm \frac{1}{2}$, can be obtained for magnetic vortices (merons). Here, we discuss the physics of magnets with fractional topological charge which is neither integer nor half-integer. We argue that in ferromagnetic films with cubic anisotropy, textures with $\mathcal Q=\pm\frac{1}{6} $ or $\pm\frac{1}{8}$ arise naturally when three or more magnetic domains meet. We also show that a single magnetic skyrmion with $\mathcal Q =-1$ can explode into four fractional defects, each carrying charge $\mathcal Q=-\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we investigate a point defect with a non-quantised fractional charge ($\mathcal Q\neq \frac{n}{m}, n,m\in\mathbb{Z}$) which can move parallel to a magnetic domain wall. Only defects with fractional charge lead to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for magnons. We investigate the resulting forces on a fractional defect due to magnon currents.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $s^\pm$-wave superconductivity enhanced by electronic doping in trilayer nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported signatures of superconductivity in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Without electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals show a bonding-antibonding and nonbonding splitting behavior via the O $p_z$ orbitals inducing a ``trimer'' lattice in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, analogous to the dimers of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The Fermi surface consists of three electron sheets with mixed $e_g$ orbitals, and a hole and an electron pocket made up of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. In addition, we find that superconducting pairing is induced in the $s^{\pm}$-wave channel due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf $\Gamma$}=$(0, 0)$ point. With changing electronic density $n$, the $s^\pm$ instability remains leading and its pairing strength shows a dome-like behavior with a maximum around $n = 4.2$ ($\sim 6.7\%$ electron doping). The superconducting instability disappears at the same electronic density as that in the new 1313 stacking La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, correlated with the vanishing of the hole pocket that arises from the trilayer sublattice, suggesting that the high-$T_c$ superconductivity of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may $not$ originate from a trilayer- and single-layer structure. Furthermore, we predict an interesting spin-density-wave state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with an in-plane ($\pi$, $\pi$) order and antiferromagnetic coupling between the top and bottom Ni layers, while the middle layer has spin zero.</description>

      <title>Frobenius light cone and the shift unitary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bound the time necessary to implement the shift unitary on a one-dimensional ring, both using local Hamiltonians and those with power-law interactions. This time is constrained by the Frobenius light cone; hence we prove that (for certain power law exponents) shift unitaries cannot be implemented in the same amount of time needed to prepare long-range Bell pairs. We note an intriguing similarity between the proof of our results, and the hardness of preparing symmetry-protected topological states with symmetry-preserving Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping conformal defect operators on a line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory with cubic anisotropic symmetry in presence of a line defect. We compute the correlators of the low lying defect operators using Feynman diagrams and derive explicit expressions for the two, three and four point defect correlators at the cubic fixed point in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions to $O(\epsilon)$. We also compute the defect $g$-function for this setup and demonstrate that this is in agreement with the $g$-theorem, which states that the $g$-function is monotonic under the renormalisation group flow along the defect. Next, we focus on conformal bootstrap techniques to determine the CFT data associated with the defect operators, which is the main objective of the paper. We utilize the framework of crossing symmetric Polyakov bootstrap and compute the averaged CFT data to $O(\epsilon)$ up to a finite number of ambiguities. We comment on unmixing the CFT data for the double trace operators at $O(\epsilon)$ and use this to compute the $O(\epsilon^2)$ data. Finally, we study these defect correlators non-perturbatively using numerical methods and isolate them near the free theory limit close to four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum phase transitions driven by a displacement field in the twisted MoTe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under an applied out-of-plane displacement field. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches are believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on disordered spin chains. Constraints on the Hilbert space confine the dynamics to a subspace, effectively reducing the Hilbert space dimension and enabling the study of larger systems with limited computational resources. We study the PXP model, and in addition, we construct spin chains with constraints by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach larger system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. We find that avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Results from exact diagonalization are compared with those from studying the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>
