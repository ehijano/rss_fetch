      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. Nearly half a century later, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to proton and neutron's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Confronting our state-of-the-art pQCD predictions with the available data for nucleon Dirac form factors, in both space-like and time-like regions, imposes a stringent test on the validity of the parameterized forms of nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which have been predicted by a class of QCD sum rules-based models and lattice QCD simulation.</description>

      <title>From square plaquettes to triamond lattices for SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theory should be able to address significant new scientific questions when implemented on quantum computers. In practice, error-mitigation techniques have already allowed encouraging progress on small lattices. In this work we focus on a truncated version of SU(2) gauge theory, which is a familiar non-Abelian step toward quantum chromodynamics. First, we demonstrate effective error mitigation for imaginary time evolution on a lattice having two square plaquettes, obtaining the ground state using an IBM quantum computer and observing that this would have been impossible without error mitigation. Then we propose the triamond lattice as an expedient approach to lattice gauge theories in three spatial dimensions and we derive the Hamiltonian. Finally, error-mitigated imaginary time evolution is applied to the three-dimensional triamond unit cell, and its ground state is obtained from an IBM quantum computer. Future work will want to relax the truncation on the gauge fields, and the triamond lattice is increasingly valuable for such studies.</description>

      <title>Loop unitary and phase band topological invariant in generic multi-band Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>
