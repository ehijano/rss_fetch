      <title>Applications of Entropy in Data Analysis and Machine Learning: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its origin in the thermodynamics of the 19th century, the concept of entropy has also permeated other fields of physics and mathematics, such as Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics, Information Theory, Probability Theory, Ergodic Theory and the Theory of Dynamical Systems. Specifically, we are referring to the classical entropies: the Boltzmann-Gibbs, von Neumann, Shannon, Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies. In addition to their common name, which is historically justified (as we briefly describe in this review), other commonality of the classical entropies is the important role that they have played and are still playing in the theory and applications of their respective fields and beyond. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in the course of time, many other instances of the overarching concept of entropy have been proposed, most of them tailored to specific purposes. Following the current usage, we will refer to all of them, whether classical or new, simply as entropies. Precisely, the subject of this review is their applications in data analysis and machine learning. The reason for these particular applications is that entropies are very well suited to characterize probability mass distributions, typically generated by finite-state processes or symbolized signals. Therefore, we will focus on entropies defined as positive functionals on probability mass distributions and provide an axiomatic characterization that goes back to Shannon and Khinchin. Given the plethora of entropies in the literature, we have selected a representative group, including the classical ones. The applications summarized in this review finely illustrate the power and versatility of entropy in data analysis and machine learning.</description>

      <title>LAPD: Langevin-Assisted Bayesian Active Learning for Physical Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering physical laws from data is a fundamental challenge in scientific research, particularly when high-quality data are scarce or costly to obtain. Traditional methods for identifying dynamical systems often struggle with noise sensitivity, inefficiency in data usage, and the inability to quantify uncertainty effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Langevin-Assisted Active Physical Discovery (LAPD), a Bayesian framework that integrates replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin Monte Carlo to simultaneously enable efficient system identification and robust uncertainty quantification (UQ). By balancing gradient-driven exploration in coefficient space and generating an ensemble of candidate models during exploitation, LAPD achieves reliable, uncertainty-aware identification with noisy data. In the face of data scarcity, the probabilistic foundation of LAPD further promotes the integration of active learning (AL) via a hybrid uncertainty-space-filling acquisition function. This strategy sequentially selects informative data to reduce data collection costs while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate LAPD on diverse nonlinear systems such as the Lotka-Volterra, Lorenz, Burgers, and Convection-Diffusion equations, demonstrating its robustness with noisy and limited data as well as superior uncertainty calibration compared to existing methods. The AL extension reduces the required measurements by around 60% for the Lotka-Volterra system and by around 40% for Burgers' equation compared to random data sampling, highlighting its potential for resource-constrained experiments. Our framework establishes a scalable, uncertainty-aware methodology for data-efficient discovery of dynamical systems, with broad applicability to problems where high-fidelity data acquisition is prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>PAC Learning with Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most basic lower bounds in machine learning is that in nearly any nontrivial setting, it takes $\textit{at least}$ $1/\epsilon$ samples to learn to error $\epsilon$ (and more, if the classifier being learned is complex). However, suppose that data points are agents who have the ability to improve by a small amount if doing so will allow them to receive a (desired) positive classification. In that case, we may actually be able to achieve $\textit{zero}$ error by just being "close enough". For example, imagine a hiring test used to measure an agent's skill at some job such that for some threshold $\theta$, agents who score above $\theta$ will be successful and those who score below $\theta$ will not (i.e., learning a threshold on the line). Suppose also that by putting in effort, agents can improve their skill level by some small amount $r$. In that case, if we learn an approximation $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ such that $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$ and use it for hiring, we can actually achieve error zero, in the sense that (a) any agent classified as positive is truly qualified, and (b) any agent who truly is qualified can be classified as positive by putting in effort. Thus, the ability for agents to improve has the potential to allow for a goal one could not hope to achieve in standard models, namely zero error.
  In this paper, we explore this phenomenon more broadly, giving general results and examining under what conditions the ability of agents to improve can allow for a reduction in the sample complexity of learning, or alternatively, can make learning harder. We also examine both theoretically and empirically what kinds of improvement-aware algorithms can take into account agents who have the ability to improve to a limited extent when it is in their interest to do so.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Softmax Gating Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) has recently emerged as an effective framework to advance the efficiency and scalability of machine learning models by softly dividing complex tasks among multiple specialized sub-models termed experts. Central to the success of MoE is an adaptive softmax gating mechanism which takes responsibility for determining the relevance of each expert to a given input and then dynamically assigning experts their respective weights. Despite its widespread use in practice, a comprehensive study on the effects of the softmax gating on the MoE has been lacking in the literature. To bridge this gap in this paper, we perform a convergence analysis of parameter estimation and expert estimation under the MoE equipped with the standard softmax gating or its variants, including a dense-to-sparse gating and a hierarchical softmax gating, respectively. Furthermore, our theories also provide useful insights into the design of sample-efficient expert structures. In particular, we demonstrate that it requires polynomially many data points to estimate experts satisfying our proposed \emph{strong identifiability} condition, namely a commonly used two-layer feed-forward network. In stark contrast, estimating linear experts, which violate the strong identifiability condition, necessitates exponentially many data points as a result of intrinsic parameter interactions expressed in the language of partial differential equations. All the theoretical results are substantiated with a rigorous guarantee.</description>

      <title>Exploring specialization and sensitivity of convolutional neural networks in the context of simultaneous image augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing parallels with the way biological networks are studied, we adapt the treatment--control paradigm to explainable artificial intelligence research and enrich it through multi-parametric input alterations. In this study, we propose a framework for investigating the internal inference impacted by input data augmentations. The internal changes in network operation are reflected in activation changes measured by variance, which can be decomposed into components related to each augmentation, employing Sobol indices and Shapley values. These quantities enable one to visualize sensitivity to different variables and use them for guided masking of activations. In addition, we introduce a way of single-class sensitivity analysis where the candidates are filtered according to their matching to prediction bias generated by targeted damaging of the activations. Relying on the observed parallels, we assume that the developed framework can potentially be transferred to studying biological neural networks in complex environments.</description>

      <title>DO-IQS: Dynamics-Aware Offline Inverse Q-Learning for Optimal Stopping with Unknown Gain Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Inverse Optimal Stopping (IOS) problem where, based on stopped expert trajectories, one aims to recover the optimal stopping region through continuation and stopping gain functions approximation. The uniqueness of the stopping region allows the use of IOS in real-world applications with safety concerns. While current state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning methods recover both a Q-function and the corresponding optimal policy, they fail to account for specific challenges posed by optimal stopping problems. These include data sparsity near the stopping region, non-Markovian nature of the continuation gain, a proper treatment of boundary conditions, the need for a stable offline approach for risk-sensitive applications, and a lack of a quality evaluation metric. These challenges are addressed with the proposed Dynamics-Aware Offline Inverse Q-Learning for Optimal Stopping (DO-IQS), which incorporates temporal information by approximating the cumulative continuation gain together with the world dynamics and the Q-function without querying to the environment. Moreover, a confidence-based oversampling approach is proposed to treat the data sparsity problem. We demonstrate the performance of our models on real and artificial data including an optimal intervention for critical events problem.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Extending Continuous-Mixture Identifiability Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For continuous mixtures of random variables, we provide a simple criterion -- generating-function accessibility -- to extend previously known kernel-based identifiability (or unidentifiability) results to new kernel distributions. This criterion, based on functional relationships between the relevant kernels' moment-generating functions or Laplace transforms, may be applied to continuous mixtures of both discrete and continuous random variables. To illustrate the proposed approach, we present results for several specific kernels.</description>

      <title>Feature Matching Intervention: Leveraging Observational Data for Causal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in causal discovery from observational data is the absence of perfect interventions, making it difficult to distinguish causal features from spurious ones. We propose an innovative approach, Feature Matching Intervention (FMI), which uses a matching procedure to mimic perfect interventions. We define causal latent graphs, extending structural causal models to latent feature space, providing a framework that connects FMI with causal graph learning. Our feature matching procedure emulates perfect interventions within these causal latent graphs. Theoretical results demonstrate that FMI exhibits strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability. Experiments further highlight FMI's superior performance in effectively identifying causal features solely from observational data.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample valid prediction of future insurance claims in the regression problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current insurance literature, prediction of insurance claims in the regression problem is often performed with a statistical model. This model-based approach may suffer from several drawbacks: (i) model misspecification, (ii) selection effect, and (iii) lack of finite-sample validity. This article addresses these three issues simultaneously by employing conformal prediction-a general machine learning strategy for valid predictions. The proposed method is both model-free and tuning-parameter-free. It also guarantees finite-sample validity at a pre-assigned coverage probability level.</description>

      <title>Deep Causal Behavioral Policy Learning: Applications to Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning-based approach to studying dynamic clinical behavioral regimes in diverse non-randomized healthcare settings. Our proposed methodology - deep causal behavioral policy learning (DC-BPL) - uses deep learning algorithms to learn the distribution of high-dimensional clinical action paths, and identifies the causal link between these action paths and patient outcomes. Specifically, our approach: (1) identifies the causal effects of provider assignment on clinical outcomes; (2) learns the distribution of clinical actions a given provider would take given evolving patient information; (3) and combines these steps to identify the optimal provider for a given patient type and emulate that provider's care decisions. Underlying this strategy, we train a large clinical behavioral model (LCBM) on electronic health records data using a transformer architecture, and demonstrate its ability to estimate clinical behavioral policies. We propose a novel interpretation of a behavioral policy learned using the LCBM: that it is an efficient encoding of complex, often implicit, knowledge used to treat a patient. This allows us to learn a space of policies that are critical to a wide range of healthcare applications, in which the vast majority of clinical knowledge is acquired tacitly through years of practice and only a tiny fraction of information relevant to patient care is written down (e.g. in textbooks, studies or standardized guidelines).</description>

      <title>Can Diffusion Models Provide Rigorous Uncertainty Quantification for Bayesian Inverse Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms that have been developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA), for diffusion model based posterior sampling. The framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion model based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. Algorithms within our framework were tested on model problems with a Gaussian mixture prior and likelihood functions inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of the algorithms. The results demonstrate that BIPSDA algorithms can provide strong performance on the image inpainting and x-ray tomography based problems, while the challenging phase retrieval problem, which is difficult to sample from even when the posterior density is known, remains outside the reach of the diffusion model based samplers.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Multi-Round Large Language Model Reasoning: Approximability, Learnability and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in cognitive science and multi-round reasoning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that iterative thinking processes improve problem-solving performance in complex tasks. Inspired by this, approaches like Chain-of-Thought, debating, and self-refinement have been applied to auto-regressive LLMs, achieving significant successes in tasks such as mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-hop question answering. Despite these successes, the theoretical basis for how multi-round reasoning enhances problem-solving abilities remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the approximation, learnability, and generalization properties of multi-round auto-regressive models. We show that Transformers with finite context windows are universal approximators for steps of Turing-computable functions and can approximate any Turing-computable sequence-to-sequence function through multi-round reasoning. We extend PAC learning to sequence generation and demonstrate that multi-round generation is learnable even when the sequence length exceeds the model's context window. Finally, we examine how generalization error propagates across rounds, and show how the aforementioned approaches can help constrain this error, ensuring outputs stay within an expectation boundary. This work sheds light on the systemic theoretical foundations of multi-round sequence learning and reasoning, emphasizing its role in inference complexity.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Theory of Power Law Spectral Bias in the Learning Dynamics of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an analytical framework for understanding how the learned distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging the Gaussian equivalence principle, we derived exact solutions for the gradient-flow dynamics of weights in one- or two-layer linear denoiser settings with arbitrary data. Remarkably, these solutions allowed us to derive the generated distribution in closed form and its KL divergence through training. These analytical results expose a pronounced power-law spectral bias, i.e., for weights and distributions, the convergence time of a mode follows an inverse power law of its variance. Empirical experiments on both Gaussian and image datasets demonstrate that the power-law spectral bias remains robust even when using deeper or convolutional architectures. Our results underscore the importance of the data covariance in dictating the order and rate at which diffusion models learn different modes of the data, providing potential explanations for why earlier stopping could lead to incorrect details in image generative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use tools from random matrix theory to study the multi-spiked tensor model, i.e., a rank-$r$ deformation of a symmetric random Gaussian tensor. In particular, thanks to the nature of local optimization methods used to find the maximum likelihood estimator of this model, we propose to study the phase transition phenomenon for finding critical points of the corresponding optimization problem, i.e., those points defined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Moreover, we characterize the limiting alignments between the estimated signals corresponding to a critical point of the likelihood and the ground truth signals. With the help of these results, we propose a new estimator of the rank-$r$ tensor weights by solving a system of polynomial equations, which is asymptotically unbiased contrary the maximum likelihood estimator.</description>

      <title>Paths and Ambient Spaces in Neural Loss Landscapes</title>

Abstract: Understanding the structure of neural network loss surfaces, particularly the emergence of low-loss tunnels, is critical for advancing neural network theory and practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to directly embed loss tunnels into the loss landscape of neural networks. Exploring the properties of these loss tunnels offers new insights into their length and structure and sheds light on some common misconceptions. We then apply our approach to Bayesian neural networks, where we improve subspace inference by identifying pitfalls and proposing a more natural prior that better guides the sampling procedure.</description>

      <title>Early-Stopped Mirror Descent for Linear Regression over Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-stopped iterative optimization methods are widely used as alternatives to explicit regularization, and direct comparisons between early-stopping and explicit regularization have been established for many optimization geometries. However, most analyses depend heavily on the specific properties of the optimization geometry or strong convexity of the empirical objective, and it remains unclear whether early-stopping could ever be less statistically efficient than explicit regularization for some particular shape constraint, especially in the overparameterized regime. To address this question, we study the setting of high-dimensional linear regression under additive Gaussian noise when the ground truth is assumed to lie in a known convex body and the task is to minimize the in-sample mean squared error. Our main result shows that for any convex body and any design matrix, up to an absolute constant factor, the worst-case risk of unconstrained early-stopped mirror descent with an appropriate potential is at most that of the least squares estimator constrained to the convex body. We achieve this by constructing algorithmic regularizers based on the Minkowski functional of the convex body.</description>

      <title>HiGrad: Uncertainty Quantification for Online Learning and Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an immensely popular approach for online learning in settings where data arrives in a stream or data sizes are very large. However, despite an ever-increasing volume of work on SGD, much less is known about the statistical inferential properties of SGD-based predictions. Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, this paper introduces a novel procedure termed HiGrad to conduct statistical inference for online learning, without incurring additional computational cost compared with SGD. The HiGrad procedure begins by performing SGD updates for a while and then splits the single thread into several threads, and this procedure hierarchically operates in this fashion along each thread. With predictions provided by multiple threads in place, a $t$-based confidence interval is constructed by decorrelating predictions using covariance structures given by a Donsker-style extension of the Ruppert--Polyak averaging scheme, which is a technical contribution of independent interest. Under certain regularity conditions, the HiGrad confidence interval is shown to attain asymptotically exact coverage probability. Finally, the performance of HiGrad is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and a real data example. An R package \texttt{higrad} has been developed to implement the method.</description>

      <title>Statistical Advantages of Perturbing Cosine Router in Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosine router in Mixture of Experts (MoE) has recently emerged as an attractive alternative to the conventional linear router. Indeed, the cosine router demonstrates favorable performance in image and language tasks and exhibits better ability to mitigate the representation collapse issue, which often leads to parameter redundancy and limited representation potentials. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive analysis of the cosine router in MoE has been lacking. Considering the least square estimation of the cosine routing MoE, we demonstrate that due to the intrinsic interaction of the model parameters in the cosine router via some partial differential equations, regardless of the structures of the experts, the estimation rates of experts and model parameters can be as slow as $\mathcal{O}(1/\log^{\tau}(n))$ where $\tau &gt; 0$ is some constant and $n$ is the sample size. Surprisingly, these pessimistic non-polynomial convergence rates can be circumvented by the widely used technique in practice to stabilize the cosine router -- simply adding noises to the $\ell^2$-norms in the cosine router, which we refer to as \textit{perturbed cosine router}. Under the strongly identifiable settings of the expert functions, we prove that the estimation rates for both the experts and model parameters under the perturbed cosine routing MoE are significantly improved to polynomial rates. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation studies in both synthetic and real data settings to empirically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>State Space Models are Provably Comparable to Transformers in Dynamic Token Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks based on state space models (SSMs) are attracting significant attention in sequence modeling since their computational cost is much smaller than that of Transformers. While the capabilities of SSMs have been demonstrated through experiments in various tasks, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, most theoretical studies discuss the capabilities of SSM layers without nonlinear layers, and there is a lack of discussion on their combination with nonlinear layers. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of SSMs combined with fully connected neural networks, and show that they are comparable to Transformers in extracting the essential tokens depending on the input. As concrete examples, we consider two synthetic tasks, which are challenging for a single SSM layer, and demonstrate that SSMs combined with nonlinear layers can efficiently solve these tasks. Furthermore, we study the nonparametric regression task, and prove that the ability of SSMs is equivalent to that of Transformers in estimating functions belonging to a certain class.</description>

      <title>Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amortized meta-learning methods based on pre-training have propelled fields like natural language processing and vision. Transformer-based neural processes and their variants are leading models for probabilistic meta-learning with a tractable objective. Often trained on synthetic data, these models implicitly capture essential latent information in the data-generation process. However, existing methods do not allow users to flexibly inject (condition on) and extract (predict) this probabilistic latent information at runtime, which is key to many tasks. We introduce the Amortized Conditioning Engine (ACE), a new transformer-based meta-learning model that explicitly represents latent variables of interest. ACE affords conditioning on both observed data and interpretable latent variables, the inclusion of priors at runtime, and outputs predictive distributions for discrete and continuous data and latents. We show ACE's modeling flexibility and performance in diverse tasks such as image completion and classification, Bayesian optimization, and simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Dimensional Item Factor Analysis: A Deep Adversarial Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning and representation learning have transformed item factor analysis (IFA) in the item response theory (IRT) literature by enabling more efficient and accurate parameter estimation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</description>

      <title>Multiaccuracy and Multicalibration via Proxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the use of predictive machine learning algorithms increases in high-stakes decision-making, it is imperative that these algorithms are fair across sensitive groups. Unfortunately, measuring and enforcing fairness in real-world applications can be challenging due to missing or incomplete sensitive group data. Proxy-sensitive attributes have been proposed as a practical and effective solution in these settings, but only for parity-based fairness notions. Knowing how to evaluate and control for fairness with missing sensitive group data for newer and more flexible frameworks, such as multiaccuracy and multicalibration, remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that in the absence of sensitive group data, proxy-sensitive attributes can provably be used to derive actionable upper bounds on the true multiaccuracy and multicalibration, providing insights into a model's potential worst-case fairness violations. Additionally, we show that adjusting models to satisfy multiaccuracy and multicalibration across proxy-sensitive attributes can significantly mitigate these violations for the true, but unknown, sensitive groups. Through several experiments on real-world datasets, we illustrate that approximate multiaccuracy and multicalibration can be achieved even when sensitive group information is incomplete or unavailable.</description>

      <title>The Feeling of Success: Does Touch Sensing Help Predict Grasp Outcomes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.05512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A successful grasp requires careful balancing of the contact forces. Deducing whether a particular grasp will be successful from indirect measurements, such as vision, is therefore quite challenging, and direct sensing of contacts through touch sensing provides an appealing avenue toward more successful and consistent robotic grasping. However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other modalities. Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally difficult. In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that combines vision and touch. To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and from both modalities together. Our experimental results indicate that incorporating tactile readings substantially improve grasping performance.</description>

      <title>Bounding Evidence and Estimating Log-Likelihood in VAE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many crucial problems in deep learning and statistical inference are caused by a variational gap, i.e., a difference between model evidence (log-likelihood) and evidence lower bound (ELBO). In particular, in a classical VAE setting that involves training via an ELBO cost function, it is difficult to provide a robust comparison of the effects of training between models, since we do not know a log-likelihood of data (but only its lower bound). In this paper, to deal with this problem, we introduce a general and effective upper bound, which allows us to efficiently approximate the evidence of data. We provide extensive theoretical and experimental studies of our approach, including its comparison to the other state-of-the-art upper bounds, as well as its application as a tool for the evaluation of models that were trained on various lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Scalable Stochastic Gaussian Process Regression via Learnable Coreset-based Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel stochastic variational inference method for Gaussian process ($\mathcal{GP}$) regression, by deriving a posterior over a learnable set of coresets: i.e., over pseudo-input/output, weighted pairs. Unlike former free-form variational families for stochastic inference, our coreset-based variational $\mathcal{GP}$ (CVGP) is defined in terms of the $\mathcal{GP}$ prior and the (weighted) data likelihood. This formulation naturally incorporates inductive biases of the prior, and ensures its kernel and likelihood dependencies are shared with the posterior. We derive a variational lower-bound on the log-marginal likelihood by marginalizing over the latent $\mathcal{GP}$ coreset variables, and show that CVGP's lower-bound is amenable to stochastic optimization. CVGP reduces the dimensionality of the variational parameter search space to linear $\mathcal{O}(M)$ complexity, while ensuring numerical stability at $\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ time complexity and $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$ space complexity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new training algorithm for deep neural networks that utilize random complex exponential activation functions. Our approach employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure to iteratively train network layers, avoiding global and gradient-based optimization while maintaining error control. It consistently attains the theoretical approximation rate for residual networks with complex exponential activation functions, determined by network complexity. Additionally, it enables efficient learning of multiscale and high-frequency features, producing interpretable parameter distributions. Despite using sinusoidal basis functions, we do not observe Gibbs phenomena in approximating discontinuous target functions.</description>

      <title>Unifying Causal Representation Learning with the Invariance Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) aims at recovering latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations to solve causal downstream tasks, such as predicting the effect of new interventions or more robust classification. A plethora of methods have been developed, each tackling carefully crafted problem settings that lead to different types of identifiability. These different settings are widely assumed to be important because they are often linked to different rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy, even though this correspondence is not always exact. This work shows that instead of strictly conforming to this hierarchical mapping, many causal representation learning approaches methodologically align their representations with inherent data symmetries. Identification of causal variables is guided by invariance principles that are not necessarily causal. This result allows us to unify many existing approaches in a single method that can mix and match different assumptions, including non-causal ones, based on the invariance relevant to the problem at hand. It also significantly benefits applicability, which we demonstrate by improving treatment effect estimation on real-world high-dimensional ecological data. Overall, this paper clarifies the role of causal assumptions in the discovery of causal variables and shifts the focus to preserving data symmetries.</description>

      <title>From Sparse Dependence to Sparse Attention: Unveiling How Chain-of-Thought Enhances Transformer Sample Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models (LLM). While current theoretical studies often attribute this improvement to increased expressiveness and computational capacity, we argue that expressiveness is not the primary limitation in the LLM regime, as current large models will fail on simple tasks. Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT.</description>

      <title>On Discriminative Probabilistic Modeling for Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the discriminative probabilistic modeling on a continuous domain for the data prediction task of (multimodal) self-supervised representation learning. To address the challenge of computing the integral in the partition function for each anchor data, we leverage the multiple importance sampling (MIS) technique for robust Monte Carlo integration, which can recover InfoNCE-based contrastive loss as a special case. Within this probabilistic modeling framework, we conduct generalization error analysis to reveal the limitation of current InfoNCE-based contrastive loss for self-supervised representation learning and derive insights for developing better approaches by reducing the error of Monte Carlo integration. To this end, we propose a novel non-parametric method for approximating the sum of conditional probability densities required by MIS through convex optimization, yielding a new contrastive objective for self-supervised representation learning. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm for solving the proposed objective. We empirically compare our algorithm to representative baselines on the contrastive image-language pretraining task. Experimental results on the CC3M and CC12M datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of our algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/bokun-wang/NUCLR.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse PCA via Block-Diagonalization</title>

Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is a pivotal tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, Sparse PCA is a challenging problem in both theory and practice: it is known to be NP-hard and current exact methods generally require exponential runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently approximate Sparse PCA by (i) approximating the general input covariance matrix with a re-sorted block-diagonal matrix, (ii) solving the Sparse PCA sub-problem in each block, and (iii) reconstructing the solution to the original problem. Our framework is simple and powerful: it can leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant computational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the approximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the runtime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and with sparsity constant $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm, reduces the runtime to $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{d^\star} \cdot g(k, d^\star) + d^2\right)$, where $d^\star \leq d$ is the largest block size of the block-diagonal matrix. For instance, integrating our framework with the Branch-and-Bound algorithm reduces the complexity from $g(k, d) = \mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d^k)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k^3\cdot d \cdot (d^\star)^{k-1})$, demonstrating exponential speedups if $d^\star$ is small. We perform large-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 100.50, while maintaining an average approximation error of 0.61%; for approximate Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.00 and an average approximation error of -0.91%, meaning that our method oftentimes finds better solutions.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Truthful Collaboration in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed collaborative learning method, where multiple clients learn together by sharing gradient updates instead of raw data. However, it is well-known that FL is vulnerable to manipulated updates from clients. In this work we study the impact of data heterogeneity on clients' incentives to manipulate their updates. First, we present heterogeneous collaborative learning scenarios where a client can modify their updates to be better off, and show that these manipulations can lead to diminishing model performance. To prevent such modifications, we formulate a game in which clients may misreport their gradient updates in order to "steer" the server model to their advantage. We develop a payment rule that provably disincentivizes sending modified updates under the FedSGD protocol. We derive explicit bounds on the clients' payments and the convergence rate of the global model, which allows us to study the trade-off between heterogeneity, payments and convergence. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of our payment rule in the FedSGD, median-based aggregation FedSGD and FedAvg protocols on three tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. In all cases we find that our scheme successfully disincentivizes modifications.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Learning Approach to Bayesian Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering a unique causal structure is difficult due to both inherent identifiability issues, and the consequences of finite data. As such, uncertainty over causal structures, such as those obtained from a Bayesian posterior, are often necessary for downstream tasks. Finding an accurate approximation to this posterior is challenging, due to the large number of possible causal graphs, as well as the difficulty in the subproblem of finding posteriors over the functional relationships of the causal edges. Recent works have used meta-learning to view the problem of estimating the maximum a-posteriori causal graph as supervised learning. Yet, these methods are limited when estimating the full posterior as they fail to encode key properties of the posterior, such as correlation between edges and permutation equivariance with respect to nodes. Further, these methods also cannot reliably sample from the posterior over causal structures. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian meta learning model that allows for sampling causal structures from the posterior and encodes these key properties. We compare our meta-Bayesian causal discovery against existing Bayesian causal discovery methods, demonstrating the advantages of directly learning a posterior over causal structure.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in many fields of science and engineering. Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, while sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions. Although generative models in machine learning have made significant progress in modeling high-dimensional non-Gaussian distributions, their inefficiency in online updating limits their applicability to filtering problems. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a novel latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework facilitates efficient density estimation and sampling using invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, and it enables the construction of filters in a data-driven manner, without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of FBF.</description>
