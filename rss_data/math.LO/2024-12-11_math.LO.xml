      <title>A note on dually Dedekind finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $A$ is dually Dedekind finite if every surjection from $A$ onto $A$ is injective; otherwise, $A$ is dually Dedekind infinite. It is proved consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) that there is a family $\langle A_n\rangle_{n\in\omega}$ of sets such that, for all $n\in\omega$, $A_n^n$ is dually Dedekind finite whereas $A_n^{n+1}$ is dually Dedekind infinite. This resolves a question that was left open in [J. Truss, Fund. Math. 84, 187--208 (1974)].</description>

      <title>G\"odel's Program in Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G\"odel proved in the 1930s in his famous Incompleteness Theorems that not all statements in mathematics can be proven or disproven from the accepted ZFC axioms. A few years later he showed the celebrated result that Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis is consistent. Afterwards, G\"odel raised the question whether, despite the fact that there is no reasonable axiomatic framework for all mathematical statements, natural statements, such as Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis, can be decided via extending ZFC by large cardinal axioms. While this question has been answered negatively, the problem of finding good axioms that decide natural mathematical statements remains open. There is a compelling candidate for an axiom that could solve G\"odel's problem: V = Ultimate-L. In addition, due to recent results the Sealing scenario has gained a lot of attention. We describe these candidates as well as their impact and relationship.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of free type III actions of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that measure-class-preserving non-amenable treeable equivalence relations of type III, meaning not preserving any equivalent $\sigma$-finite measure, are induced by free actions of non-abelian free groups of any given number of generators, including infinitely generated free groups, with the additional property that no ends of the induced Schreier graph are vanishing. This is done using a characterization of type III due to Hopf for transformations and Dang-Ngoc-Nghiem in general. This highlights the difference between the type III setting and the measure-preserving setting.</description>

      <title>Constructive theory of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Chapter 3 of his Notes on constructive mathematics, Martin-L{\"o}f describes recursively constructed ordinals. He gives a constructively acceptable version of Kleene's computable ordinals. In fact, the Turing definition of computable functions is not needed from a constructive point of view. We give in this paper a constructive theory of ordinals that is similar to Martin-L{\"o}f's theory, but based only on the two relations "$x \leq y$" and "$x &lt; y$", i.e., without considering sequents whose intuitive meaning is a classical disjunction. In our setting, the operation "supremum of ordinals" plays an important r\^ole through its interactions with the relations "$x \leq y$" and "$x &lt; y$". This allows us to approach as much as we may the notion of linear order when the property "$\alpha \leq \beta$ or $\beta \leq \alpha$" is provable only within classical logic. Our aim is to give a formal definition corresponding to intuition, and to prove that our constructive ordinals satisfy constructively all desirable properties. Note that by adding classical logic, we would recover the ordinals of usual classical mathematics, at the cost of a loss of computability for most statements given in the usual form.</description>
