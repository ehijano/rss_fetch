      <title>Effects of Coal Particles on Microbubble-Enhanced Bitumen Separation in the Concentrated Slurry Flow of Oil Sands Tailings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study investigates the segregation of bitumen residues within the transport pipeline before disposal in the presence of coal particles in carriers and microbubbles. Coal particles decreased the bitumen recovery by 17% without the injection of microbubbles. In addition, the improvement in bitumen recovery efficiency by 6 mL of H2O2 is negligible due to a small number of bubbles formed from H2O2 decomposition in the flow. However, tremendous enhancement in the recovery efficiency was achieved with the simultaneous addition of coal particles and H2O2. Further increase in recovery was noted as a larger volume of H2O2 was injected to form more microbubbles. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to help understand the effects of coal particles and microbubbles. The simulation results illustrated that the introduction of coal particles caused bitumen contents to accumulate in the middle of the pipe. Furthermore, an increased volume fraction of microbubbles contributed to a higher distribution of bitumen at the top of the pipe. This study not only offers valuable insights for developing an innovative strategy to enhance the efficiency of bitumen separation in hydrotransport processes but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions among bubbles, bitumen, and coal particles in a slurry flow.</description>

      <title>Enhanced accumulation of bitumen residue in a highly concentrated tailings flow by microbubbles from in-situ catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive volume of oil sands tailings has been one of the most challenging environmental issues. In this work, we experimentally explore a simple and effective approach to bitumen residue separation from a highly concentrated slurry flow of the artificial oil sands tailings. By utilizing microbubbles from in-situ catalytic decomposition of H2O2 at low concentrations, bitumen aggregation is enhanced on the top part of the hydrotransport pipeline. The microscopic image analysis revealed the in-situ formation of microbubbles and confirmed that magnetic particles present in the slurries contributed to the fast release of the gas products and bubble formation from hydrogen peroxide decomposition. A high-speed camera was applied to capture images of the tailings flow in the pipeline through a transparent view window. A large number of tiny bubbles were identified post to the injection of H2O2 to the slurry flow. More than 70 % bitumen could be recovered from a lab-scale pipeline loop within 30 mins after injection. The bitumen recovery efficiency from the collected froth was quantitatively compared under seven conditions with varied dosages, the concentration of H2O2, and the amount of magnetic solids in the slurries. Our results confirmed that the total dosage of H2O2 is the dominant factor in in-situ microbubble formation for enhanced bitumen aggregation in the flow. Importantly, microbubbles were generated rapidly in the real mature fine tailings. The results from our study provide insights into the preferential distribution of oil residue in the flow during hydrotransport without the requirement for an additional device. Removal of oily residues from concentrated slurries may bring economical and environmental advantages.</description>

      <title>Mechanism generating reverse buoyancy flux at the small scales of stably stratified turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that at the small-scales of stably stratified turbulence, the scale-dependent buoyancy flux reverses sign, such that there is a conversion of turbulent potential energy (TPE) back into turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at these scales. Moreover, the magnitude of the reverse flux becomes stronger with increasing Prandtl number $Pr$. Using a filtering analysis we demonstrate analytically how this flux reversal is connected to the mechanism identified in Bragg \&amp; de Bruyn Kops (JFM 2024 Vol 991 A10) that is responsible for the surprising observation that the TKE dissipation rate increases while the TPE dissipation rate decreases with increasing $Pr$ in stratified turbulence. The mechanism identified by Bragg \&amp; de Bruyn Kops, which is connected to the formation of ramp-cliff structures in the density field, is shown to give the scale-local contribution to the buoyancy flux. At the smallest-scales this local contribution dominates and explains the flux reversal, while at larger scales a non-local contribution is important. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of 3D statistically stationary, stably stratified turbulence in the strongly stratified regime confirm the theoretical analysis, and indicate that while on average the local contribution only dominates the buoyancy flux at the smallest scales, it remains strongly correlated with the buoyancy flux at all scales. The results show that ramp-cliffs are not only connected to the reversal of the local buoyancy flux but also the non-local part. At the small scales (approximately below the Ozmidov scale), ramp structures contribute exclusively to reverse buoyancy flux events, whereas cliff structures contribute to both forward and reverse buoyancy flux events.</description>

      <title>Recovery of turbulent boundary layers from pressure gradient history effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study experimentally investigates the recovery of smooth-wall turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) following non-equilibrium pressure gradients (PGs). The imposed pressure gradient history (PGH) comprises favourable-adverse pressure gradient (FAPG) sequences of varying strength, followed by recovery to zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) conditions. Hot-wire anemometry measurements were obtained at multiple downstream stations in the recovery region, with friction Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau$ ranging from 2000 to 6000 depending on downstream development. Comparative analysis at matched $Re_\tau$ and Clauser pressure gradient parameter $\beta$ enables clear assessment of history effects on TBL behaviour. Results show that increasing PGH strength enhances the wake in mean velocity profiles and amplifies turbulence intensities across the boundary layer, including the inner peak, logarithmic region, and outer peak (a signature of APG). Downstream, the mean flow gradually recovers toward a ZPG-like state, but turbulence in the outer region retains a lasting impact of PGH. Spectral analysis indicates that PGH primarily affects outer-layer scales, introducing a distinct PG peak and modifying the VLSM peak - with energy amplification dependent on PGH strength and spatial characteristics governed by history effects. Downstream recovery involves merging of large-scale wavelengths and the reorganisation of turbulence structures toward a ZPG-like state - although the `recovered' VLSM streamwise length becomes shortened due to the mixing of lengthscales with the PG peak. These results demonstrate that even under matched local parameters, TBLs retain a clear imprint of their upstream history, consistent with the findings of Preskett et al. (2025); moreover, this study provides new insights regarding the central role of scale interactions in the recovery mechanism of TBL subjected to complex PGH.</description>

      <title>Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.</description>

      <title>State estimation in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using super-resolution with a 4DVar training algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational data assimilation and machine-learning based super-resolution are two alternative approaches to state estimation in turbulent flows. The former is an optimisation problem featuring a time series of coarse observations, the latter usually requires a library of high-resolution 'ground truth' data. We show that the classic '4DVar' data assimilation algorithm can be used to train neural networks for super-resolution in three-dimensional isotropic turbulence without the need for high-resolution reference data. To do this, we adapt a pseudo-spectral version of the fully-differentiable JAX-CFD solver (Kochkov et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 118, 2021) to three-dimensional flows and combine it with a convolutional neural network for super-resolution. As a result we are able to include entire trajectories in our loss function which is minimised with gradient-based optimisation to define the neural network weights. We show that the resulting neural networks outperform 4DVar for state estimation at initial time over a wide variety of metrics, though 4DVar leads to more robust predictions towards the end of its assimilation window. We also present a hybrid approach in which the trained neural network output is used to initialise 4DVar. The resulting performance is more than twice as accurate as other state estimation strategies for all times and performs well even beyond known limiting lengthscales, all without requiring access to high-resolution measurements at any point.</description>

      <title>Cavitation onset in transient pressure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is well known that cavitation occurs in liquids under tension, no universally accepted criterion for its onset in transient pressure fields exists. We propose a precise definition of the critical tension for cavitation in transient pressure fields that bridges the gap between quasi-static and dynamic regimes, identifying cavitation as the transition of the bubble radius to a dynamically unstable state. This threshold depends on the instantaneous state of the gas-liquid system and, when combined with an appropriate set of dimensionless parameters, yields a self-similar description of cavitation onset. Phase maps for different liquids reveal a minimum tension required for the onset of cavitation, determined by the duration of the tension event and the initial bubble size, whereby the well-known Blake threshold is the lower bound for cavitation across all conditions.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport mechanisms in long-lived stable Ekman layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted for long-lived stable atmospheric boundary layers (SABLs) maintained by constant ambient stratification and surface cooling. The study examines how stratification mechanism and strength influence turbulence within a four-dimensional parameter space defined by the stratification perturbation parameter ($\Pi_s$), wind-forcing parameter ($\Pi_w$), Rossby-radius factor ($\Pi_f$), and Prandtl number. A regime map in the $\Pi_s-\Pi_w$ plane identifies linearly stable, very stable, and weakly stable regimes, showing that turbulence sustenance is inherently multi-parametric. At low $\Pi_s$ and high $\Pi_w$, a weakly stable regime with persistent turbulence emerges. The SABL exhibits a multilayered thermal structure-comprising a near-surface stable layer, an intermediate unstable layer, and an overlying inversion-that strengthens with decreasing $\Pi_s$, indicating enhanced downward heat transport. Turbulence statistics reveal weak dependence of the momentum field and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on stratification, while buoyancy and turbulent potential energy (TPE) show strong sensitivity due to additional production from turbulent heat flux interacting with ambient stratification. Energy transfer occurs among mean gradients, momentum-buoyancy flux, and TKE-TPE exchange. The turbulent Prandtl number exhibits strong vertical variation, exceeding values typical of nocturnal SABLs, underscoring the limits of constant eddy-diffusivity models. Barycentric anisotropy maps indicate weak near-surface effects but enhanced isotropy aloft. These results motivate improved parameterizations for ambient-stratification-dominated SABLs.</description>

      <title>Fluid-structure interaction analysis with interface control principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interface control principle is proposed for unsteady fluid-structure in- teraction (FSI) analyses. This principle introduces a method of explicitly controlling the interface motion in the temporal direction to minimize the residual force on the interface, which is defined as the discrepancy between the fluid and structural forces. The interface model is constructed using a data-driven approach that involves sparse identification of nonlinear dy- namics with control to evaluate the residual force. The interface model is subsequently subjected to control theory in order to minimize the residual force. Following the convergence of the residual force, the interface state is controlled to be that of the original unsteady FSI system. The fluid and structural simulations can be conducted independently without communication, as the interface state information is predetermined as inputs for each system. The proposed method is applied to the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a cylinder at a Reynolds number of 150 under several reduced velocity conditions corresponding to the lock-in regime with limit-cycle oscillations. The results demonstrate that the residual force is sufficiently minimized in time, and when the residual force is close to zero, the predicted fluid force and structural displacement of the VIV show good agreement with the reference FSI simulation.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Form PINNS (MF-PINNS) For Solving The Coupled Stokes-Darcy Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel physical information neural networks (P-PINNs) have been widely used to solve systems with
  multiple coupled physical fields, such as the coupled Stokes-Darcy equations with Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) interface
  conditions. However, excessively high or low physical constants in partial differential equations (PDE) often lead to ill conditioned loss functions and can even cause the failure of training numerical solutions for PINNs. To solve this problem,
  we develop a new kind of enhanced parallel PINNs, MF-PINNs, in this article. Our MF-PINNs combines the velocity pressure form (VP) with the stream-vorticity form (SV) and add them with adjusted weights to the total loss functions.
  The results of numerical experiments show our MF-PINNs have successfully improved the accuracy of the streamline fields
  and the pressure fields when kinematic viscosity and permeability tensor range from 1e-4 to 1e4. Thus, our MF-PINNs
  hold promise for more chaotic PDE systems involving turbulent flows. Additionally, we also explore the best combination of
  the activation functions and their periodicity. And we also try to set the initial learning rate and design its decay strategies.

      <title>A volume-of-fluid model for biomass particle pyrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical models of biomass particle pyrolysis focus on either the solid particle evolution or on the surrounding gas-phase dynamics, neglecting the coupled interactions between the two. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a single-grid model that fully resolves both phases without relying on sub-grid-scale correlations. The model adopts an Eulerian representation of the two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the interface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase pyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture the coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle shrinkage. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in this multidimensional framework. The resulting model demonstrates mass conservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental data shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and correct volatiles trends. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, but they also highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution of the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the development of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups, developed within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically well-balanced geostrophic reconstruction finite volumes numerical schemes for the 2D rotating NLSWE in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of large-scale geophysical fluids is primarily governed by the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient.
  This phenomenon, known as geostrophic equilibrium, is the basis for the geostrophic model, which has proven to be extremely useful for understanding and forecasting large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.
  In the present work, we develop second- and third-order finite-volume numerical schemes applied to the 2D rotating shallow-water equations in spherical coordinates. These schemes are designed to preserve the geostrophic equilibrium in the limit as the Rossby number tends to zero.
  The final goal is to design reliable and efficient forecasting models for simulating meteotsunamis, long-wave events generated in the ocean by atmospheric pressure disturbances. These disturbances produce long waves of small amplitude that gradually amplify as they approach the coast.
  The numerical results for various analytical and real-world test cases underscore the importance of maintaining geostrophic equilibrium over time.</description>

      <title>PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning strategies for accelerating reinforcement-learning-based flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows. Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance, convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments, can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust, scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be applied to more complex flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Improving performance estimation of a PCM-integrated solar chimney through reduced-order based data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM) integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and 203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal swimming in viscoelastic granular hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study a scallop-like swimmer with reciprocally flapping wings in a nearly frictionless, cohesive granular medium consisting of hydrogel spheres. Significant locomotion is found when the swimmer's flapping frequency matches the inverse relaxation time of the material. Remarkably, the swimmer moves in the opposite direction compared to its motion in a cohesion-free granular material of hard plastic spheres. At higher or lower frequencies, we observe no motion of the swimmer, apart from a short initial transient phase. X-ray radiograms reveal that the wing motions create low-density zones, which in turn give rise to a hysteresis in drag and propulsion forces. This time-dependent effect, combined with the swimmer's inertia, accounts for locomotion at intermediate frequencies.</description>

      <title>A purely analytical and physical wind turbine wake model accounting for atmospheric stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A purely analytical wake model for wind turbines is derived, anchored exclusively in physical interactions between atmospheric turbulence and turbine dynamics, and thus inherently accounting for atmospheric stratification. Unlike empirical models relying on assumed wake deficit shapes or tunable coefficients, this model predicts the wake deficit solely from measurable properties of the inflow, namely, turbulence intensity and the turbulence integral time scale. Systematic validation against Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for both IEA 15MW and NREL 5MW turbines, simulated in Meso-NH under stable, neutral, and unstable conditions, demonstrates excellent agreement across atmospheric regimes. Importantly, the model requires these specific turbulence statistics as input but shows only weak sensitivity to the integral time scale, ensuring robustness even with moderate uncertainties in inflow characterisation. Comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art Super-Gaussian analytical model highlights superior performance of the present approach, particularly for unstable and neutral stratification. These results show that the predictive accuracy gained by incorporating richer inflow physics justifies the need for more comprehensive atmospheric inputs, providing a clear pathway for physically grounded, calibration-free wake modeling in operational wind energy contexts.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation and propulsion of suspended capsules in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of elastic capsules suspended in two-dimensional active nematic fluids using lattice Boltzmann simulations. The capsules, modeled as flexible membranes enclosing active internal regions, exhibit a rich variety of behaviors shaped by their geometry and the interplay between internal and external activity. Circular capsules with active interiors undergo persistent rotation driven by internally confined +1/2 topological defects. Axisymmetric capsules, such as boomerangs, develop directed motion along their axis of symmetry due to unbalanced active forces generated by defect distributions near their boundaries. We further show that capsule flexibility suppresses motility and rotation, as active stresses are dissipated into shape deformations. These findings reveal how shape, deformability, and defect dynamics cooperate to produce emergent motility in soft active matter, with potential applications in the design of microswimmers and drug delivery vehicles.</description>

      <title>PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework for modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose behavior can, in principle, be described by PDEs but lack explicit models. The method extends the Equation-Free approach, enabling the data-driven reconstruction of reduced-order models (ROMs) without needing to identify governing equations. Using manifold learning, we obtain a latent space representation of system evolution from data via delayed coordinates, in accordance with Takens/Whitney's embedding theorems. Linear (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, POD) and nonlinear (Diffusion Maps, DMs) methods are employed to extract low-dimensional embeddings that capture the essential dynamics. Predictive ROMs are then learned within this latent space, and their evolution is lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We show that both POD and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) lifting operators preserve mass, a key physical constraint in systems such as computational fluid dynamics and crowd dynamics. Our framework effectively reconstructs the solution operator of the underlying PDE without discovering the PDE itself, by leveraging a manifold-informed objective map that bridges multiple scales. For our illustrations, we use synthetic spatio-temporal data from the Hughes model, which couples a continuity PDE with an Eikonal equation describing optimal path selection in crowds. Results show that DM-based nonlinear embeddings outperform POD in reconstruction accuracy, producing more parsimonious and stable ROMs that remain accurate and integrable over long time horizons.</description>

      <title>Compressible and immiscible fluids with arbitrary density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the water-air system, the bulk density ratio is as high as about 1000; no model can fully tackle such a high density ratio system. In the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations, the density $\rho$ within the water-air interface is assumed to be a constant based on the Boussinesq approximation namely $\rho (\mathrm{d} \mathbf u/\mathrm{d} t)$, which does not account for the true momentum evolution $\mathrm{d} (\rho \mathbf u)/\mathrm{d} t$ ($\mathbf u$-fluid velocity). Here, we present an alternative theory for the density evolution equations of immiscible fluids in computational fluid dynamics, differing from the concept of Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Our derivation is built upon the physical principle of energy minimization from the aspect of thermodynamics. The present results provide a generalization of Bernoulli's principle for energy conservation and a general formulation for the sound speed. The present model can be applied for immiscible fluids with arbitrarily high density ratios, thereby, opening a new window for computational fluid dynamics both for compressible and incompressible fluids.</description>

      <title>Dynamic stall reattachment revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic stall on airfoils is an undesirable and potentially dangerous phenomenon. The motto for aerodynamic systems with unsteadily moving wings, such as helicopters or wind turbines, is that prevention beats recovery. In case prevention fails or is not feasible, we need to know when recovery starts, how long it takes, and how we can improve it. This study revisits dynamic stall reattachment to identify the sequence of events during flow and load recovery and to characterise key observable features in the pressure, force, and flow field. Our analysis is based on time-resolved velocity field and surface pressure data obtained experimentally for a two-dimensional, sinusoidally pitching thin airfoil. Stall recovery is a transient process that does not start immediately when the angle of attack falls below the critical stall angle. The onset of recovery is delayed to angles below the critical stall angle and the duration of the reattachment delay decreases with increasing unsteadiness of the pitching motion. An angle of attack below the critical angle is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to initiate the stall recovery process. We identified a critical value of the leading-edge suction parameter, independent of the pitch rate, that is a threshold beyond which reattachment consistently initiates. Based on prominent changes in the evolution of the shear layer, the leading-edge suction, and the lift deficit due to stall, we divided the reattachment process into three stages: the reaction delay, wave propagation, and the relaxation stage, and extracted the characteristic features and time-scales for each stage.</description>

      <title>Fluid-induced snap-through instability of spherical shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell induced by a viscous flow, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability in viscous flow, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous stochasticity in the fluctuating Navier-Stokes equations on a logarithmic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The predictability of turbulent flows remains a challenging problem for mathematicians, physicists, and meteorologists. In this context, we consider the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with small-scale random forcing on logarithmic lattices in Fourier space. Our goal is to probe the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity in this system, which means that its solutions remain stochastic in the limit of vanishing viscosity and noise. For this, we consider numerical simulations with increasing Reynolds numbers and vanishing noise amplitudes. Through measurements of statistics of individual large-scale Fourier modes, we verify the spontaneous stochasticity in two different setups: from rough initial data, and after a finite-time blowup of a strong solution. The convergence of probability density functions for distinct parameters suggests that the limiting solution is a universal stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Stability of trapped fluid clusters in two-phase porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in multiphase flow through porous media is to understand and predict the conditions under which trapped fluid clusters become mobilized. Here, we investigate the stability of such clusters in two-phase flow and present a simple, quasistatic model that accurately determines the critical Bond number (that is, the critical ratio between the average pressure gradient of the flow and the surface tension) for the onset of cluster mobilization. The model is derived by combining elementary geometrical considerations with mass conservation and a mechanical equilibrium condition, resulting in a system of coupled differential equations. Our derivation sheds new light on the mechanisms that govern cluster stability. In addition, since the number of equations equals the number of cluster openings, our model is significantly faster than direct numerical simulations of the same problem and enables efficient exploration of the system's parameter space. Using this approach, we highlight a discrepancy with the prediction of current mean-field theories, which predict that the largest stable cluster size scales in proportion to $r/\text{Bo}^\alpha$, where $r$ is a typical pore size, $\text{Bo}$ is the Bond number and $\alpha$ is a fixed exponent. We discuss the mechanisms that explain the breakdown of the mean field theories, and we show that a scaling law of this form can only exist if $\alpha$ is allowed to depend on a broad set of flow and geometric parameters.</description>
