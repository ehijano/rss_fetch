      <title>Flow Of Information In a Mechanically Quenched Confined Flock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living entities in a group communicate and transfer information to one another for a variety of reasons. It might be for foraging food, migration, or escaping threats and obstacles, etc. They do so by interacting with each other and also with the environment. The tools from statistical mechanics and information theory can be useful to analyze the flow of information among the living entities modelled as active (i.e. self-propelling) particles. Here we consider the active particles confined in a circular trap. The self-organisation of the particles crucially depends on whether the trap boundary is soft or hard. We quench the trap boundary from soft to hard instantaneously. After the mechanical quench, the particles suddenly find themselves in a hard potential. The self-organised cluster of the active particles, which was stable when the boundary was soft, becomes unstable. The cluster undergoes extreme deformation after the quench to find another stable configuration suitable for the hard potential. Together with the structural relaxation, information regarding the quench also flows throughout the deforming cluster. Here, we quantify the flow of information by computing local transfer entropy. We find that the flow spans the whole cluster, propagating ballistically.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chemotactic Strategies with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a flexible and efficient method for programming micro-robots in complex environments. Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners' training fails. We find that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the efficiency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of repetitive, ultra-short soft X-ray pulses from processing of steel with ultrafast lasers on human cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast lasers, with pulse durations below a few picoseconds, are of significant interest to the industry, offering a cutting-edge approach to enhancing manufacturing processes and enabling the fabrication of intricate components with unparalleled accuracy. When processing metals at irradiances exceeding the evaporation threshold of about 10^10 W/cm2 these processes can generate ultra-short, soft X-ray pulses with photon energies above 5 keV. This has prompted extensive discussions and regulatory measures on radiation safety. However, the impact of these ultra-short X-ray pulses on molecular pathways in the context of living cells, has not been investigated so far. Using laser pulses of 250 fs and 6.7 ps, along with pulse repetition rates exceeding 10 kHz, we conducted the first molecular characterization of epithelial cell responses to ultra-short soft X-ray pulses generated during processing of steel with ultrafast lasers. Ambient exposure of vitro human cell cultures, followed by imaging of the DNA damage response and fitting of the data to an experimentally calibrated model of dose rate estimation, revealed a linear increase in the DNA damage response relative to the exposure dose. This is in line with findings from work using continuous wave soft X-ray sources and suggests that the ultra-short X-ray pulses do not generate additional hazard. This research contributes valuable insights into the biological effects of ultrafast laser processes and their potential implications for user safety.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions in crowd dynamics: investigating the impact of moving threats on pedestrian speed preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, such as human-human, human-vehicle, and human-robot systems, often have serious impacts on pedestrian safety and social order. A more comprehensive understanding of these systems is needed to optimize system stability and efficiency. Despite the importance of these interactions, empirical research in this area remains limited. Thus, in our study we explore this underresearched area, focusing on scenarios where nonreciprocity plays a critical role, such as mass stabbings, which pose a substantial risk to public safety. We conducted the first experiments on this system and analysed high-accuracy data obtained from these experiments. The extent of the direct threat zone is determined by the speed of the moving threat and the radius of danger occurrence. We further categorize potential threats into direct, adjacent, and rear-view zones, quantifying the level of threat for pedestrians. Our study revealed that a pedestrian's desired velocity correlated positively with potential threat intensity, increasing until near the direct threat zone. An emerging steady state is observed when escape routes are blocked by moving threats. This deviation affects the density-velocity relationship, making it distinct from the general relationship. This deviation signifies unique pedestrian behaviour in the presence of moving threats. Additionally, the rate of change in the angle for pedestrian motion in various desired directions is synchronized. This indicates the emergence of collective intelligence in nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems. As a result, our study may constitute a pioneering step towards understanding nonreciprocal interactions in crowd systems through laboratory experiments. These findings may enhance pedestrian safety and inform not only government crowd management strategies but also individual self-protection measures.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering suppression for in vivo optical coherence tomography measurement using B-scan-wise multi-focus averaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained quantitative magnetization transfer imaging: disentangling T1 of the free and semi-solid spin pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, it has been widely assumed that Henkelman's two spin pools have similar longitudinal relaxation times, which motivated many researchers to constrain them to each other. However, several recent publications reported a $T_1^s$ of the semi-solid spin pool that is much shorter than $T_1^f$ of the free pool. While these studies tailored experiments for robust proofs-of-concept, we here aim to quantify the disentangled relaxation processes on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e., with an effective resolution of 1.24mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an unconstrained MT model. We scanned four people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and four healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated $T_1^f \approx 1.84$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.34$s in healthy white matter. Our results confirm the reports that $T_1^s \ll T_1^f$ and we argue that this finding identifies MT as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in brain tissue. Moreover, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s \approx 0.212$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$ in normal-appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences between individuals with MS and controls.</description>

      <title>Capillary adhesion of stick insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress within the last few decades has revealed the functional morphology of an insect's sticky footpads -- a soft, sponge-like pad that secretes a thin liquid film. However, the physico-chemical mechanisms underlying their adhesion remain elusive. Here, we explore these underlying mechanisms by simultaneously measuring adhesive force and contact geometry of the adhesive footpads of live, tethered Indian stick insects, \textit{Carausius morosus}, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in body mass. We find that the adhesive force we measure is similar to previous measurements that use a centrifuge. Our measurements afford use the opportunity to directly probe the adhesive stress \textit{in vivo}, and use existing theory on capillary adhesion to predict the surface tension of the secreted liquid and compare it to previous assumptions. From our predictions, we find that the surface tension required to generate the adhesive stresses we observed ranges between 0.68 mN/m and 12 mN/m. The low surface tension of the liquid would enhance the wetting of the stick insect's footpads and promote their ability to conform to various substrates. Our insights may inform the biomimetic design of capillary-based, reversible adhesives and motivate future studies on the capillary properties of the secreted liquid.</description>
