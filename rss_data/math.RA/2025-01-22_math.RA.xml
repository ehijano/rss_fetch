      <title>Cubic norm pairs and hermitian cubic norm structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize cubic norm structures to cubic norm pairs and extend hermitian cubic norm structures to arbitrary commutative unital rings. For the associated ``skew dimension one structurable algebra" of these pairs, we construct a corresponding Lie algebra and a group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra. Using the structure of this automorphism group, we also prove that each hermitian cubic norm structure induces an operator Kantor pair.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and deformations of nonabelian embedding tensors between Lie triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we introduce the notion of nonabelian embedding tensors between Lie triple systems and show that nonabelian embedding tensors induce naturally 3-Leibniz algebras. Next, we construct an $L_{\infty}$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are nonabelian embedding tensors. Then, we have the twisted $L_{\infty}$-algebra that governs deformations of nonabelian embedding tensors. Following this, we establish the cohomology of a nonabelian embedding tensor between Lie triple systems and realize it as the cohomology of the descendent 3-Leibniz algebra with coefficients in a suitable representation. As applications, we consider infinitesimal deformations of a nonabelian embedding tensor between Lie triple systems and demonstrate that they are governed by the above-established cohomology. Furthermore, the notion of Nijenhuis elements associated with a nonabelian embedding tensor is introduced to characterize trivial infinitesimal deformations. Finally, we provide relationships between nonabelian embedding tensors on Lie algebras and associated Lie triple systems.</description>

      <title>Using cyclic $(f,\sigma)$-codes over finite chain rings to construct $\mathbb{Z}_p$- and $\mathbb{F}_q[\![t]\!]$-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattices and $\mathbb{F}_q[\![t]\!]$-lattices from cyclic $(f,\sigma)$-codes over finite chain rings, employing quotients of natural nonassociative orders and principal left ideals in carefully chosen nonassociative algebras. This approach generalizes the classical Construction A that obtains $\mathbb{Z}$-lattices from linear codes over finite fields or commutative rings to the nonassociative setting. We mostly use proper nonassociative cyclic algebras that are defined over field extensions of $p$-adic fields. This means we focus on $\sigma$-constacyclic codes to obtain $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattices, hence $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattice codes. We construct linear maximum rank distance (MRD) codes that are $\mathbb{Z}_p$-lattice codes employing the left multiplication of a nonassociative algebra over a finite chain ring.
  Possible applications of our constructions include post-quantum cryptography involving $p$-adic lattices, e.g. learning with errors, building rank-metric codes like MRD-codes, or $p$-adic coset coding, in particular wire-tap coding.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the biderivations of 4-dimensional nilpotent complex Leibniz algebras. Using the existing classification of these algebras, we develop algorithms to compute derivations, antiderivations, and biderivations as pairs of matrices with respect to a fixed basis. By utilizing computer algebra software such as Mathematica and Maple, we provide detailed descriptions and examples to illustrate these computations.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis operators and mock-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebra is a mock-Lie algebra equipped with a Nijenhuis operator. The purpose of this paper is to extend the well-known results about Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras to the realm of mock-Lie bialgebras. It aims to characterize Nijenhuis mock-Lie bialgebras by generalizing the concepts of matched pairs and Manin triples of mock-Lie algebras to the context of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras. Moreover, we discuss formal deformation theory and explore infinitesimal formal deformations of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras, demonstrating that the associated cohomology corresponds to a deformation cohomology. Moreover, we define abelian extensions of Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras and show that equivalence classes of such extensions are linked to cohomology groups. The coboundary case leads to the introduction of an admissible mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation (mLYBe) in Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras, for which the antisymmetric solutions give rise to Nijenhuis mock-Lie bialgebras. Furthermore, the notion of $\mathcal O$-operator on Nijenhuis mock-Lie algebras is introduced and connected to mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>On GK Dimension and Generator Bounds for a Class of Graded Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{monotonic algebras}, a broad class of algebras that includes all Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension at most four, as well as algebras with \textit{pure} resolutions, such as Koszul and piecewise Koszul algebras. We show that the Gelfand-Kirillov (GK) dimension of these algebras is bounded above by their global dimension and establish a similar result for the minimal number of generators. Furthermore, we prove a parity theorem for Artin-Schelter regular algebras, demonstrating that the difference between their global dimension and GK dimension is always an even integer.</description>

      <title>Additive subgroups of a module that are saturated with respect to a fixed subset of the ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be an $A$-module. We study the additive subgroups $F$ of $M$ such that, for all $x \in M$, if $tx \in F$ for some $t \in T$, then $x \in F$. We call any such subset $F$ of $M$ a \emph{$T$-factroid of $M$}, which is a kind of dual to the notion of a $T$-submodule of $M$. We connect the notion with the zero-divisors on $M$, various classes of primary and prime ideals of $A$, Euclidean domains, and the recent concepts of unit-additive commutative rings and of Egyptian fractions with respect to a multiplicative subset of a commutative ring. We also introduce a common generalization of local rings and unit-additive rings, called *sublocalizing* rings, and relate them to $T$-factroids.</description>

      <title>Finitely Generated Varieties of Commutative BCK-algebras: Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article aims at describing all covers of any finitely generated variety of cBCK-algebras. It is known that subdirectly irreducible cBCK-algebras are rooted trees (concerning their order). Also, all subdirectly irreducible members of finitely generated variety are subalgebras of subdirectly irreducible generators of that variety. The first part of the article focuses on subalgebras of finite subdirectly irreducible cBCK-algebras. In the second part of the article, a construction is presented that provides all the covers of any finitely generated variety.</description>

      <title>Extending structures for anti-dendriform algebras and anti-dendriform bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first explore the extending structures problem by the unified product for anti-dendriform algebras. In particular,the crossed product and non-abelian extension are studied. Furthermore, we explore the inducibility problem of pairs of automorphisms associated with a non-abelian extension of anti-dendriform algebras, and derive the fundamental sequences of Wells. Then we introduce the bicrossed products and matched pairs of anti-dendriform algebras to solve the factorization problem. Finally, we introduce the notion of anti-dendriform D-bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to double construction of associative algebras with respect to the commutative Cone cocycles. Both of them are interpreted in terms of certain matched pairs of associative algebras as well as the compatible anti-dendriform algebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the AD-YBE, whose skew-symmetric solutions give coboundary anti-dendriform D-bialgebras. The notion of O-operators of anti-dendriform algebras is introduced to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the AD-YBE. We also characterize the relationship between the skew-symmetric solutions of AD-YBE and O-operators.</description>

      <title>Two Generalizations of co-Hopfian Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By defining the classes of generalized co-Hopfian and relatively co-Hopfian groups, respectively, we consider two expanded versions of the generalized co-Bassian groups and of the classical co-Hopfian groups giving a close relationship with them. Concretely, we completely describe generalized co-Hopfian p-groups for some prime p obtaining that such a group is either divisible, or it splits into a direct sum of a special bounded group and a special co-Hopfian group. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of a torsion-free generalized co-Hopfian group is obtained. In addition, we fully characterize when a mixed splitting group and, in certain cases, when a genuinely mixed group are generalized co-Hopfian. Finally, complete characterizations of a super hereditarily generalized co-Hopfian group as well as of a hereditarily generalized co-Hopfian group are given, showing in the latter situation that it decomposes as the direct sum of three specific summands. Moreover, we totally classify relatively co-Hopfian p-groups proving the unexpected fact that they are exactly the co-Hopfian ones. About the torsion-free and mixed cases, we show in light of direct decompositions that in certain situations they are satisfactory classifiable -- e.g., the splitting mixed relatively co-Hopfian groups and the relatively co-Hopfian completely decomposable torsion-free groups. Finally, complete classifications of super and hereditarily relatively co-Hopfian groups are established in terms of ranks which rich us that these two classes curiously do coincide.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs and Yang-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ferri and Sciandra introduced two equivalent algebraic structures, matched pair of actions on an arbitrary Hopf algebra and Yetter-Drinfeld brace. In fact, they equivalently produce braiding operators satisfying the braid equation, thus generalize the construction of Yang-Baxter operators by Lu, Yan and Zhu from braiding operators on groups, and also by Angiono, Galindo and Vendramin from cocommutative Hopf braces. In this paper, we provide equivalence conditions for such kind of Yang-Baxter operators to be involutive. Particularly, we give a positive answer for an open problem raised by Ferri and Sciandra, namely, a matched pair of actions on a Hopf algebra $H$ induces an involutive Yang-Baxter operator if and only if its intrinsic Hopf algebra in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ is braided commutative. As an illustration, we use a simplified characterization to classify matched pairs of actions on the 8-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf algebra $A_{C_2\times C_2}$ and analyze the associated Yang-Baxter operators to find that they are all involutive.</description>

      <title>When algebra twinks system biology: a conjecture on the structure of Gr\"obner bases in complex chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of identifying all real positive steady states in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) governed by mass-action kinetics. Traditional numerical methods often require specific initial guesses and may fail to find all the solutions in systems exhibiting multistability. Gr\"obner bases offer an algebraic framework that systematically transforms polynomial equations into simpler forms, facilitating comprehensive solution enumeration. In this work, we propose a conjecture that CRNs with at most pairwise interactions yield Gr\"obner bases possessing a near-"triangular" structure, under appropriate assumptions. We illustrate this phenomenon using examples from a gene regulatory network and the Wnt signaling pathway, where the Gr\"obner basis approach reliably captures all real positive solutions. Our computational experiments reveal the potential of Gr\"obner bases to overcome limitations of local numerical methods for finding the steady states of complex biological systems, making them a powerful tool for understanding dynamical processes across diverse biochemical models.</description>

      <title>Even Order Pascal Tensors are Positive Definite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that even order Pascal tensors are positive definite, and odd order Pascal tensors are strongly completely positive. The significance of these is that our induction proof method also holds for some other families of completely positives tensors, whose construction satisfies certain rules, such an inherence property holds. We show that for all tensors in such a family, even order tensors would be positive definite, and odd order tensors would be strongly completely positive, as long as the matrices in this family are positive definite. In particular, we show that even order generalized Pascal tensors would be positive definite, and odd order generalized Pascal tensors would be strongly completely positive, as long as generalized Pascal matrices are positive definite. We also investigate even order positive definiteness and odd order strongly completely positivity for fractional Hadamard power tensors. Furthermore, we study determinants of Pascal tensors.

      <title>Categories of sets with infinite addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sets with infinite addition, called $\Sigma$-monoids, and contribute to their literature in three ways. First, our definition subsumes those from previous works and allows us to relate them in terms of adjuctions between their categories. In particular, we discuss $\Sigma$-monoids with additive inverses. Second, we show that every Hausdorff commutative monoid is a $\Sigma$-monoid, and that there is a free Hausdorff commutative monoid for each $\Sigma$-monoid. Third, we prove that $\Sigma$-monoids have well-defined tensor products, unlike topological abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Universal graph series, chromatic functions, and their index theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce the concept of universal graph series. We then present four invariants of graphs and discuss some of their properties. In particular, one of these invariants is a generalization of the chromatic symmetric function and a complete invariant for graphs.</description>

      <title>Quantum group coproducts and universality under scalar extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

      <title>Tilting in $Q$-shaped derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is that there is sometimes a triangulated equivalence between $D_Q( A )$, the $Q$-shaped derived category of an algebra $A$, and $D( B )$, the classic derived category of a different algebra $B$. By construction, $D_Q( A )$ consists of $Q$-shaped diagrams of $A$-modules for a suitable small category $Q$. Our result concerns the case where $Q$ consists of shifts of indecomposable projective modules over a self-injective $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebra $\Lambda$.
  A notable special case is the result by Iyama, Kato, and Miyachi that $D_N( A )$, the $N$-derived category of $A$, is triangulated equivalent to $D( T_{ N-1 }A )$, the classic derived category of $T_{ N-1 }( A )$, which denotes upper diagonal $( N-1 ) \times ( N-1 )$-matrices over $A$. Several other special cases will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Foulis m-semilattices and their modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the results of Jacobs, we show that the category OMLatLin of orthomodular lattices and linear maps forms a dagger category. For each orthomodular lattice X, we construct a Foulis m-semilattice Lin(X) composed of endomorphisms of X. This m-semilattice acts as a quantale, enabling us to regard X as a left Lin(X)-module. Our novel approach introduces a fuzzy-theoretic dimension to the theory of orthomodular lattices.</description>
