      <title>Information-theoretic language of proteinoid gels: Boolean gates and QR codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an aim to build analog computers out of soft matter fluidic systems in future, this work attempts to invent a new information-theoretic language, in the form of two-dimensional Quick Response (QR) codes. This language is, effectively, a digital representation of the analog signals shown by the proteinoids. We use two different experimental techniques: (i) a voltage-sensitive dye and (ii) a pair of differential electrodes, to record the analog signals. The analog signals are digitally approximatied (synthesised) by sampling the analog signals into a series of discrete values, which are then converted into binary representations. We have shown the AND-OR-NOT-XOR-NOR-NAND-XNOR gate representation of the digitally sampled signal of proteinoids. Additional encoding schemes are applied to convert the binary code identified above to a two-dimensional QR code. As a result, the QR code becomes a digital, unique marker of a given proteinoid network. We show that it is possible to retrieve the analog signal from the QR code by scanning the QR code using a mobile phone. Our work shows that soft matter fluidic systems, such as proteinoids, can have a fundamental informatiom-theoretic language, unique to their internal information transmission properties (electrical activity in this case) - such a language can be made universal and accessible to everyone using 2D QR codes, which can digitally encode their internal properties and give an option to recover the original signal when required. On a more fundamental note, this study identifies the techniques of approximating continuum properties of soft matter fluidic systems using a series representation of gates and QR codes, which are a piece-wise digital representation, and thus one step closer to programming the fluids using information-theoretic methods, as suggested almost a decade ago by Tao's fluid program.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Patients: Simulating Difficult Conversations with Multimodal Generative AI for Medical Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem: Effective patient-centered communication is a core competency for physicians. However, both seasoned providers and medical trainees report decreased confidence in leading conversations on sensitive topics such as goals of care or end-of-life discussions. The significant administrative burden and the resources required to provide dedicated training in leading difficult conversations has been a long-standing problem in medical education.
  Approach: In this work, we present a novel educational tool designed to facilitate interactive, real-time simulations of difficult conversations in a video-based format through the use of multimodal generative artificial intelligence (AI). Leveraging recent advances in language modeling, computer vision, and generative audio, this tool creates realistic, interactive scenarios with avatars, or "synthetic patients." These synthetic patients interact with users throughout various stages of medical care using a custom-built video chat application, offering learners the chance to practice conversations with patients from diverse belief systems, personalities, and ethnic backgrounds.
  Outcomes: While the development of this platform demanded substantial upfront investment in labor, it offers a highly-realistic simulation experience with minimal financial investment. For medical trainees, this educational tool can be implemented within programs to simulate patient-provider conversations and can be incorporated into existing palliative care curriculum to provide a scalable, high-fidelity simulation environment for mastering difficult conversations.
  Next Steps: Future developments will explore enhancing the authenticity of these encounters by working with patients to incorporate their histories and personalities, as well as employing the use of AI-generated evaluations to offer immediate, constructive feedback to learners post-simulation.</description>

      <title>Bridging eResearch Infrastructure and Experimental Materials Science Process in the Quantum Data Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental materials science is experiencing significant growth due to automated experimentation and AI techniques. Integrated autonomous platforms are emerging, combining generative models, robotics, simulations, and automated systems for material synthesis. However, two major challenges remain: democratizing access to these technologies and creating accessible infrastructure for under-resourced scientists. This paper introduces the Quantum Data Hub (QDH), a community-accessible research infrastructure aimed at researchers working with quantum materials. QDH integrates with the National Data Platform, adhering to FAIR principles while proposing additional UNIT principles for usability, navigability, interpretability, and timeliness. The QDH facilitates collaboration and extensibility, allowing seamless integration of new researchers, instruments, and data into the system.</description>

      <title>Improving Object Detector Training on Synthetic Data by Starting With a Strong Baseline Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for the development of object detection models is a time-consuming and expensive process. In the military domain in particular, data collection can also be dangerous or infeasible. Training models on synthetic data may provide a solution for cases where access to real-world training data is restricted. However, bridging the reality gap between synthetic and real data remains a challenge. Existing methods usually build on top of baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that have been shown to perform well when trained on real data, but have limited ability to perform well when trained on synthetic data. For example, some architectures allow for fine-tuning with the expectation of large quantities of training data and are prone to overfitting on synthetic data. Related work usually ignores various best practices from object detection on real data, e.g. by training on synthetic data from a single environment with relatively little variation. In this paper we propose a methodology for improving the performance of a pre-trained object detector when training on synthetic data. Our approach focuses on extracting the salient information from synthetic data without forgetting useful features learned from pre-training on real images. Based on the state of the art, we incorporate data augmentation methods and a Transformer backbone. Besides reaching relatively strong performance without any specialized synthetic data transfer methods, we show that our methods improve the state of the art on synthetic data trained object detection for the RarePlanes and DGTA-VisDrone datasets, and reach near-perfect performance on an in-house vehicle detection dataset.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Qrisp QAOA: description and preliminary comparison with Qiskit counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the presentation and evaluation of the high-level quantum programming language Eclipse Qrisp. The presented framework, used for developing and compiling quantum algorithms, is measured in terms of efficiency for its implementation of the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Module. We measure this efficiency and compare it against two alternative QAOA algorithm implementations using IBM's Qiskit toolkit. The evaluation process has been carried out over a benchmark composed of 15 instances of the well-known Maximum Cut Problem. Through this preliminary experimentation, Eclipse Qrisp demonstrated promising results, outperforming both versions of its counterparts in terms of results quality and circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of magnetic tunnel junction-based computational random-access memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication, which are essential building blocks for many conventional and machine intelligence applications, are evaluated and show promising accuracy performance. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>A symmetric silicon microring resonator optical crossbar array for accelerated inference and training in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a promising platform for accelerating matrix multiplications in deep learning, leveraging the inherent parallel nature of light. Although various schemes have been proposed and demonstrated to realize such photonic matrix accelerators, the in-situ training of artificial neural networks using photonic accelerators remains challenging due to the difficulty of direct on-chip backpropagation on a photonic chip. In this work, we propose a silicon microring resonator (MRR) optical crossbar array with a symmetric structure that allows for simple on-chip backpropagation, potentially enabling the acceleration of both the inference and training phases of deep learning. We demonstrate a $4 \times 4$ circuit on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and use it to perform inference tasks of a simple neural network for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Subsequently, we train the neural network using simulated on-chip backpropagation and achieve an accuracy of 91.1% in the same inference task after training. Furthermore, we simulate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, using a $9 \times 9$ MRR crossbar array to perform the convolution operations. This work contributes to the realization of compact and energy-efficient photonic accelerators for deep learning.</description>

      <title>AnalogCoder: Analog Circuit Design via Training-Free Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog circuit design is a significant task in modern chip technology, focusing on the selection of component types, connectivity, and parameters to ensure proper circuit functionality. Despite advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in digital circuit design, the complexity and scarcity of data in analog circuitry pose significant challenges. To mitigate these issues, we introduce AnalogCoder, the first training-free LLM agent for designing analog circuits through Python code generation. Firstly, AnalogCoder incorporates a feedback-enhanced flow with tailored domain-specific prompts, enabling the automated and self-correcting design of analog circuits with a high success rate. Secondly, it proposes a circuit tool library to archive successful designs as reusable modular sub-circuits, simplifying composite circuit creation. Thirdly, extensive experiments on a benchmark designed to cover a wide range of analog circuit tasks show that AnalogCoder outperforms other LLM-based methods. It has successfully designed 20 circuits, 5 more than standard GPT-4o. We believe AnalogCoder can significantly improve the labor-intensive chip design process, enabling non-experts to design analog circuits efficiently.</description>
