      <title>SVD-based Causal Emergence for Gaussian Iterative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal emergence (CE) based on effective information (EI) shows that macro-states can exhibit stronger causal effects than micro-states in dynamics. However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) is independent of coarse-graining but is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this problem, this article proposes a pioneering CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from the SVD of covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, are given analytically. After that, we can provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectrums and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling by neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Statistical closures from the Martin-Siggia and Rose approach to turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the statistical closures suggested by the Martin-Siggia and Rose approach to statistical turbulence. We find that the formalism leads to a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the three point correlation of the velocity field. In the leading order approximation this equation becomes an explicit expression. We discuss under which approximations this closure reduces to that proposed in W D McComb and S R Yoffe, A formal derivation of the local energy transfer (LET) theory of homogeneous turbulence, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 375501 (2017). This suggests ways to improve upon this closure by dropping these restrictions, resumming the perturbative expansion and/or applying renormalization group techniques.</description>

      <title>Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal aspects of thermalization induced by Trotterization, a procedure routinely used in gate-based quantum computation. We use the reduced-BCS model -- quantum integrable with a classically integrable mean-field limit -- where the effects of Trotter chaos are expected to be particularly stark. The resulting Trotterized chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large \(\tau\) limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.</description>

      <title>Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.</description>
