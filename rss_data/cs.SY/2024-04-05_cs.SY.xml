      <title>Advanced Algorithms for Autonomous Guidance of Solar-powered UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) techniques have developed rapidly within the past few decades. Using UAVs provides benefits in numerous applications such as site surveying, communication systems, parcel delivery, target tracking, etc. The high manoeuvrability of the drone and its ability to replace a certain amount of labour cost are the reasons why it can be widely chosen. There will be more applications of UAVs if they can have longer flight time, which is a very challenging hurdle because of the energy constraint of the onboard battery. One promising solution is to equip UAVs with some lightweight solar panels to maximize flight time. Therefore, more research is needed for solar-powered UAVs (SUAVs) in different environments.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse Learning with Non-Stationary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering non-stationary environments in online optimization enables decision-maker to effectively adapt to changes and improve its performance over time. In such cases, it is favorable to adopt a strategy that minimizes the negative impact of change to avoid potentially risky situations. In this paper, we investigate risk-averse online optimization where the distribution of the random cost changes over time. We minimize risk-averse objective function using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as risk measure. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the exact CVaR gradient, we employ a zeroth-order optimization approach that queries the cost function values multiple times at each iteration and estimates the CVaR gradient using the sampled values. To facilitate the regret analysis, we use a variation metric based on Wasserstein distance to capture time-varying distributions. Given that the distribution variation is sub-linear in the total number of episodes, we show that our designed learning algorithm achieves sub-linear dynamic regret with high probability for both convex and strongly convex functions. Moreover, theoretical results suggest that increasing the number of samples leads to a reduction in the dynamic regret bounds until the sampling number reaches a specific limit. Finally, we provide numerical experiments of dynamic pricing in a parking lot to illustrate the efficacy of the designed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Policy and Lyapunov-Certificate Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents novel methods for synthesizing distributionally robust stabilizing neural controllers and certificates for control systems under model uncertainty. A key challenge in designing controllers with stability guarantees for uncertain systems is the accurate determination of and adaptation to shifts in model parametric uncertainty during online deployment. We tackle this with a novel distributionally robust formulation of the Lyapunov derivative chance constraint ensuring a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov certificate. To avoid the computational complexity involved in dealing with the space of probability measures, we identify a sufficient condition in the form of deterministic convex constraints that ensures the Lyapunov derivative constraint is satisfied. We integrate this condition into a loss function for training a neural network-based controller and show that, for the resulting closed-loop system, the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium can be certified with high confidence, even with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) model uncertainties. To demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methodology, we compare it with an uncertainty-agnostic baseline approach and several reinforcement learning approaches in two control problems in simulation.</description>

      <title>A Rolling Horizon Restoration Framework for Post-disaster Restoration of Electrical Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Severe weather events such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and large wind or ice storms can cause extensive damage to electrical distribution networks, requiring a multi-day restoration effort. Complicating the recovery process is the lack of complete and accurate information regarding the extent and locations of damages, at least during the initial part of the recovery process. These factors make workforce planning challenging. In this paper, we adopt a rolling horizon restoration framework whereby repairs are planned for adjustable finite length restoration windows. Considering both repair times as well as travel times, we show that the optimal scheduling problem with multiple crews, each with their own time budget, can be recast in terms of a cost constrained reward maximizing mTSP (traveling salesman problem) on doubly weighted graphs, where the objective is to maximize the aggregate reward earned during the upcoming restoration window, provided no crew violates its time budget and certain electrical continuity constraints are met. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving the above problem which is validated on standard IEEE PES test feeder networks.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Linear Temporal Logic Specifications Using Hybrid Zonotope-Based Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a hybrid zonotope-based approach for formally verifying the behavior of autonomous systems operating under Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. In particular, we formally verify the LTL formula by constructing temporal logic trees (TLT)s via backward reachability analysis (BRA). In previous works, TLTs are predominantly constructed with either highly general and computationally intensive level set-based BRA or simplistic and computationally efficient polytope-based BRA. In this work, we instead propose the construction of TLTs using hybrid zonotope-based BRA. By using hybrid zonotopes, we show that we are able to formally verify LTL specifications in a computationally efficient manner while still being able to represent complex geometries that are often present when deploying autonomous systems, such as non-convex, disjoint sets. Moreover, we evaluate our approach on a parking example, providing preliminary indications of how hybrid zonotopes facilitate computationally efficient formal verification of LTL specifications in environments that naturally lead to non-convex, disjoint geometries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two methods for implementing complex-valued sliding mode controllers in three-phase power converters. The paper includes the description of the algorithms and a detailed analysis of the proposed implementations. The methods, that are easy to code and have a low computational burden, retain the sliding mode properties of robustness and fast response and do not require any additional processing often used to decouple the dynamics of the three-phase system. The performance of the methods is compared in numerical simulations, and the algorithms are experimentally tested in a microcontroller using a Hardware-in-the-Loop platform.</description>

      <title>Analytical Characterization of Epileptic Dynamics in a Bistable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders globally, affecting millions of individuals. Despite significant advancements, the precise mechanisms underlying this condition remain largely unknown, making accurately predicting and preventing epileptic seizures challenging. In this paper, we employ a bistable model, where a stable equilibrium and a stable limit cycle coexist, to describe epileptic dynamics. The equilibrium captures normal steady-state neural activity, while the stable limit cycle signifies seizure-like oscillations. The noise-driven switch from the equilibrium to the limit cycle characterizes the onset of seizures. The differences in the regions of attraction of these two stable states distinguish epileptic brain dynamics from healthy ones. We analytically construct the regions of attraction for both states. Further, using the notion of input-to-state stability, we theoretically show how the regions of attraction influence the stability of the system subject to external perturbations. Generalizing the bistable system into coupled networks, we also find the role of network parameters in shaping the regions of attraction. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between brain networks and epileptic activity, offering mechanistic insights into potential avenues for more predictable treatments.</description>

      <title>AMC-backed Twin Arrow Antenna for Wearable Electronic Travel Aid System at 24 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultra-compact wearable antenna, for electronic travel aid (ETA) applications, is presented. An AMC-backed twin arrow antenna, operative in the 24.05-24.25 GHz frequency band, has been designed for imaging systems supporting ETA. Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) is combined with the antenna with the aim of reducing the backward radiation to the wearing person while improving its radiation properties and bandwidth, all this without increasing the initial area of the antenna. Prototypes of the AMC-antenna have been fabricated and measured. In order to test its performance for the application, imaging have been conducted by means of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques by placing the antenna in the arm of a user to take advantage of natural body movement. Electromagnetic images have been obtained and the target has been identified, demonstrating the suitability of the AMC-antenna for the ETA system.</description>

      <title>Setpoint control of bilinear systems from noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a controller for an unknown bilinear system using only noisy input-states data points generated by it. The controller should achieve regulation to a given state setpoint and provide a guaranteed basin of attraction. Determining the equilibrium input to achieve that setpoint is not trivial in a data-based setting and we propose the design of a controller in two scenarios. The design takes the form of linear matrix inequalities and is validated numerically for a Cuk converter.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Driven Global Optimisation Framework for Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-driven optimisation framework for analog circuit design in this paper. The primary objective is to determine the device sizes for the optimal performance of analog circuits for a given set of specifications. Our methodology entails employing machine learning models and spice simulations to direct the optimisation algorithm towards achieving the optimal design for analog circuits. Machine learning based global offline surrogate models, with the circuit design parameters as the input, are built in the design space for the analog circuits under study and is used to guide the optimisation algorithm, resulting in faster convergence and a reduced number of spice simulations. Multi-layer perceptron and random forest regressors are employed to predict the required design specifications of the analog circuit. Since the saturation condition of transistors is vital in the proper working of analog circuits, multi-layer perceptron classifiers are used to predict the saturation condition of each transistor in the circuit. The feasibility of the candidate solutions is verified using machine learning models before invoking spice simulations. We validate the proposed framework using three circuit topologies--a bandgap reference, a folded cascode operational amplifier, and a two-stage operational amplifier. The simulation results show better optimum values and lower standard deviations for fitness functions after convergence. Incorporating the machine learning-based predictions proposed in the optimisation method has resulted in the reduction of spice calls by 56%, 59%, and 83% when compared with standard approaches in the three test cases considered in the study.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Adversarial Autoencoder for Cyber Attack Detection in Power Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of cyber attacks in smart power distribution grids with unbalanced configurations poses challenges due to the inherent nonlinear nature of these uncertain and stochastic systems. It originates from the intermittent characteristics of the distributed energy resources (DERs) generation and load variations. Moreover, the unknown behavior of cyber attacks, especially false data injection attacks (FDIAs) in the distribution grids with complex temporal correlations and the limited amount of labeled data increases the vulnerability of the grids and imposes a high risk in the secure and reliable operation of the grids. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an unsupervised adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model to detect FDIAs in unbalanced power distribution grids integrated with DERs, i.e., PV systems and wind generation. The proposed method utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) in the structure of the autoencoder to capture the temporal dependencies in the time-series measurements and leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for better reconstruction of the input data. The advantage of the proposed data-driven model is that it can detect anomalous points for the system operation without reliance on abstract models or mathematical representations. To evaluate the efficacy of the approach, it is tested on IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus systems with historical meteorological data (wind speed, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) as well as historical real-world load data under three types of data falsification functions. The comparison of the detection results of the proposed model with other unsupervised learning methods verifies its superior performance in detecting cyber attacks in unbalanced power distribution grids.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Structural Health Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a critical task for ensuring the safety and reliability of civil infrastructures, typically realized on bridges and viaducts by means of vibration monitoring. In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes. We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy) only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.85 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach stops at 0.91 and 0.84. On the second one, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.54 versus the 0.10 of the best existing method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Planning for Filming Groups of Moving Actors Leveraging Submodularity and Pixel Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing and filming a group of moving actors with a team of aerial robots is a challenging problem that combines elements of multi-robot coordination, coverage, and view planning. A single camera may observe multiple actors at once, and the robot team may observe individual actors from multiple views. As actors move about, groups may split, merge, and reform, and robots filming these actors should be able to adapt smoothly to such changes in actor formations. Rather than adopt an approach based on explicit formations or assignments, we propose an approach based on optimizing views directly. We model actors as moving polyhedra and compute approximate pixel densities for each face and camera view. Then, we propose an objective that exhibits diminishing returns as pixel densities increase from repeated observation. This gives rise to a multi-robot perception planning problem which we solve via a combination of value iteration and greedy submodular maximization. %using a combination of value iteration to optimize views for individual robots and sequential submodular maximization methods to coordinate the team. We evaluate our approach on challenging scenarios modeled after various kinds of social behaviors and featuring different numbers of robots and actors and observe that robot assignments and formations arise implicitly based on the movements of groups of actors. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines, and in addition to performing well with the planner's approximation of pixel densities our approach also performs comparably for evaluation based on rendered views. Overall, the multi-round variant of the sequential planner we propose meets (within 1%) or exceeds the formation and assignment baselines in all scenarios we consider.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Weather-Related Power Outage Prediction with Socio-Economic and Power Infrastructure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for hourly power outage probability prediction within census tracts encompassing a utility company's service territory. Two distinct deep learning models, conditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and unconditional MLP, were developed to forecast power outage probabilities, leveraging a rich array of input features gathered from publicly available sources including weather data, weather station locations, power infrastructure maps, socio-economic and demographic statistics, and power outage records. Given a one-hour-ahead weather forecast, the models predict the power outage probability for each census tract, taking into account both the weather prediction and the location's characteristics. The deep learning models employed different loss functions to optimize prediction performance. Our experimental results underscore the significance of socio-economic factors in enhancing the accuracy of power outage predictions at the census tract level.</description>

      <title>Robust Partitioning and Operation for Maximal Uncertain-Load Delivery in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To mitigate the vulnerability of distribution grids to severe weather events, some electric utilities use preemptive de-energization as the primary line of defense, causing significant power outages. In such instances, networked microgrids could improve resiliency and maximize load delivery, though the modeling of three-phase unbalanced network physics and computational complexity pose challenges. These challenges are further exacerbated by an increased penetration of uncertain loads. In this paper, we present a two-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem that configures and operates networked microgrids, and is guaranteed to be robust and feasible to all realizations of loads within a specified uncertainty set, while maximizing load delivery. To solve this problem, we propose a cutting-plane algorithm, with convergence guarantees, which approximates a convex recourse function with sub-gradient cuts. Finally, we provide a detailed case study on the IEEE 37-bus test system to demonstrate the economic benefits of networking microgrids to maximize uncertain-load delivery.</description>

      <title>SEPE-SQED: Symbolic Quick Error Detection by Semantically Equivalent Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic quick error detection (SQED) has greatly improved efficiency in formal chip verification. However, it has a limitation in detecting single-instruction bugs due to its reliance on the self-consistency property. To address this, we propose a new variant called symbolic quick error detection by semantically equivalent program execution (SEPE-SQED), which utilizes program synthesis techniques to find sequences with equivalent meanings to original instructions. SEPE-SQED effectively detects single-instruction bugs by differentiating their impact on the original instruction and its semantically equivalent program (instruction sequence). To manage the search space associated with program synthesis, we introduce the CEGIS based on the highest priority first algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed CEGIS approach improves the speed of generating the desired set of equivalent programs by 50% in time compared to previous methods. Compared to SQED, SEPE-SQED offers a wider variety of instruction combinations and can provide a shorter trace for triggering bugs in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions of Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we study the mean square asymptotic stability of a class of random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences dependent on the homogeneous ones. Secondly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path, and show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying in some sense, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the regularization path in mean square. Furthermore, if the data streams also satisfy the RKHS persistence of excitation condition, i.e. there exists a fixed length of time period, such that each eigenvalue of the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every time period has a uniformly positive lower bound with respect to time, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the unknown function in mean square. Finally, for the case with independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency provided the marginal probability measures induced by the input data are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>Enabling Clean Energy Resilience with Machine Learning-Empowered Underground Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the urgent challenge of climate change, there is a critical need to transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems, with renewable energy sources playing a pivotal role. However, the inherent variability of renewable energy, without effective storage solutions, often leads to imbalances between energy supply and demand. Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) emerges as a promising long-term storage solution to bridge this gap, yet its widespread implementation is impeded by the high computational costs associated with high fidelity UHS simulations. This paper introduces UHS from a data-driven perspective and outlines a roadmap for integrating machine learning into UHS, thereby facilitating the large-scale deployment of UHS.</description>

      <title>Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid in Forward Electricity Markets Using a No-Regret Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common practice in the current literature of electricity markets to use game-theoretic approaches for strategic price bidding. However, they generally rely on the assumption that the strategic bidders have prior knowledge of rival bids, either perfectly or with some uncertainty. This is not necessarily a realistic assumption. This paper takes a different approach by relaxing such an assumption and exploits a no-regret learning algorithm for repeated games. In particular, by using the \emph{a posteriori} information about rivals' bids, a learner can implement a no-regret algorithm to optimize her/his decision making. Given this information, we utilize a multiplicative weight-update algorithm, adapting bidding strategies over multiple rounds of an auction to minimize her/his regret. Our numerical results show that when the proposed learning approach is used the social cost and the market-clearing prices can be higher than those corresponding to the classical game-theoretic approaches. The takeaway for market regulators is that electricity markets might be exposed to greater market power of suppliers than what classical analysis shows.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lightweight Federated Learning for Distributed Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning scheme that enables deep learning to be applied to sensitive data streams and applications in a privacy-preserving manner. This paper focuses on the use of FL for analyzing smart energy meter data with the aim to achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods for load forecasting while ensuring the privacy of individual meter data. We show that with a lightweight fully connected deep neural network, we are able to achieve forecasting accuracy comparable to existing schemes, both at each meter source and at the aggregator, by utilising the FL framework. The use of lightweight models further reduces the energy and resource consumption caused by complex deep-learning models, making this approach ideally suited for deployment across resource-constrained smart meter systems. With our proposed lightweight model, we are able to achieve an overall average load forecasting RMSE of 0.17, with the model having a negligible energy overhead of 50 mWh when performing training and inference on an Arduino Uno platform.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSH) actively participate in grid power-frequency control and therefore often operate under dynamic conditions, which results in rapidly varying system states. Predicting these dynamically changing states is essential for comprehending the underlying sensor and machine conditions. This understanding aids in detecting anomalies and faults, ensuring the reliable operation of the connected power grid, and in identifying faulty and miscalibrated sensors. PSH are complex, highly interconnected systems encompassing electrical and hydraulic subsystems, each characterized by their respective underlying networks that can individually be represented as graphs. To take advantage of this relational inductive bias, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been separately applied to state forecasting tasks in the individual subsystems, but without considering their interdependencies. In PSH, however, these subsystems depend on the same control input, making their operations highly interdependent and interconnected. Consequently, hydraulic and electrical sensor data should be fused across PSH subsystems to improve state forecasting accuracy. This approach has not been explored in GNN literature yet because many available PSH graphs are limited to their respective subsystem boundaries, which makes the method unsuitable to be applied directly. In this work, we introduce the application of spectral-temporal graph neural networks, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to concurrently capture and learn meaningful subsystem interdependencies and the dynamic patterns observed in electric and hydraulic sensors. Our method effectively fuses data from the PSH's subsystems by operating on a unified, system-wide graph, learned directly from the data, This approach leads to demonstrably improved state forecasting performance and enhanced generalizability.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous State Estimation and Contact Detection for Legged Robots by Multiple-Model Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for combined contact detection and state estimation for legged robots. The proposed algorithm models the robot's movement as a switched system, in which different modes relate to different feet being in contact with the ground. The key element in the proposed algorithm is an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter, which identifies the currently-active mode defining contacts, while estimating the state. The rationale for the proposed estimation framework is that contacts (and contact forces) impact the robot's state and vice versa. This paper presents validation studies with a quadruped using (i) the high-fidelity simulator Gazebo for a comparison with ground truth values and a baseline estimator, and (ii) hardware experiments with the Unitree A1 robot. The simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline estimator, which does not simultaneous detect contacts. The hardware experiments showcase the applicability of the proposed algorithm and highlights the ability to detect contacts.</description>

      <title>Class-E, Active Electrically-Small Antenna for High-Power Wideband Transmission at the High-Frequency (HF) Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antennas operating at the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30 MHz) are frequently electrically small due to the large wavelength of electromagnetic waves (10-100 m). However, the bandwidth-efficiency products of passively matched electrically small antennas (ESAs) are fundamentally limited. Wideband HF waveforms using bandwidths of 24 kHz or more have recently received significant attention in military communications applications. Efficiently radiating such signals from conventional passive ESAs is very challenging due to fundamental physical limits on bandwidth-efficiency products of ESAs. However, active antennas are not subject to the same constraints. In this work, we present the design and experimental characterization of a high-power, active ESA with enhanced bandwidth-efficiency product compared to {that of} passively matched ESAs. Specifically, the proposed active ESA can radiate wideband HF signals with banwidths of 24 kHz or more, with total efficiencies up to 80$\%$, and radiated power levels approaching 100 W. Our approach uses a highly-efficient, integrated class-E switching circuit specifically designed to drive an electrically small, high-Q HF antenna over a bandwidth exceeding 24 kHz. Using a high-Q RLC antenna model, we have successfully demonstrated wideband binary ASK, PSK, and FSK modulations with the proposed class-E switching architecture. Experimental results indicate that the bandwidth-efficiency product of this class-E active antenna is 5.4-9.8 dB higher than that of an equivalent passive design with the same data rate, and bit-error-rate (BER).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel methods that allow to synthesize LPV state-feedback controllers directly from a single sequence of data and guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system, without knowing the model of the plant. We show that if the measured open-loop data from the system satisfies a persistency of excitation condition, then the full open-loop and closed-loop input-scheduling-state behavior can be represented using only the data. With this representation, we formulate synthesis problems that yield controllers that guarantee stability and performance in terms of infinite horizon quadratic cost, generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm and $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain of the closed-loop system. The controllers are synthesized by solving an SDP with a finite set of LMI constraints. Competitive performance of the proposed data-driven synthesis methods is demonstrated w.r.t. model-based synthesis that have complete knowledge of the true system model in multiple simulation studies.</description>

Abstract: Most control synthesis methods under temporal logic properties require a model of the system, however, identifying such a model can be a challenging task. In this work, we develop a direct data-driven control synthesis method for temporal logic specifications, which does not require this explicit modeling step, capable of providing certificates for the general class of linear systems. After collecting a single sequence of input-output data from the system, we construct a data-driven characterization of the behavior. Using this characterization, we synthesize a controller, such that the controlled system satisfies a (possibly unbounded) temporal logic specification. The underlying optimization problem is solved by mixed-integer linear programming. We demonstrate the applicability of the results through simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Ground Fault Detection for Inverter-Based Microgrid Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground fault detection in inverter-based microgrid (IBM) systems is challenging, particularly in a real-time setting, as the fault current deviates slightly from the nominal value. This difficulty is reinforced when there are partially decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The conventional solution of installing more relays to obtain additional measurements is costly and also increases the complexity of the system. In this paper, we propose a data-assisted diagnosis scheme based on an optimization-based fault detection filter with the output current as the only measurement. Modeling the microgrid dynamics and the diagnosis filter, we formulate the filter design as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that accounts for decoupling partial disturbances, robustness to non-decoupled disturbances and modeling uncertainties by training with data, and ensuring fault sensitivity simultaneously. To ease the computational effort, we also provide an approximate but analytical solution to this QP. Additionally, we use classical statistical results to provide a thresholding mechanism that enjoys probabilistic false-alarm guarantees. Finally, we implement the IBM system with Simulink and Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Toward Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and leverage them to schedule energy dispatch ahead of time. However, forecast models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the operational value of the forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the loss function with the overall operation cost function, thereby achieving reduced operation costs. The forecast model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. Additionally, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear regarding the forecast model output, and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used statistical quality-oriented point forecasting methods, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operation costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is more computationally efficient than traditional two-stage stochastic programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operators of Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (E-AMoD) fleets need to make several real-time decisions such as matching available vehicles to ride requests, rebalancing idle vehicles to areas of high demand, and charging vehicles to ensure sufficient range. While this problem can be posed as a linear program that optimizes flows over a space-charge-time graph, the size of the resulting optimization problem does not allow for real-time implementation in realistic settings. In this work, we present the E-AMoD control problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework to achieve drastically improved scalability and superior performance over heuristics. Specifically, we adopt a bi-level formulation where we (1) leverage a graph network-based RL agent to specify a desired next state in the space-charge graph, and (2) solve more tractable linear programs to best achieve the desired state while ensuring feasibility. Experiments using real-world data from San Francisco and New York City show that our approach achieves up to 89% of the profits of the theoretically-optimal solution while achieving more than a 100x speedup in computational time. We further highlight promising zero-shot transfer capabilities of our learned policy on tasks such as inter-city generalization and service area expansion, thus showing the utility, scalability, and flexibility of our framework. Finally, our approach outperforms the best domain-specific heuristics with comparable runtimes, with an increase in profits by up to 3.2x.</description>

Abstract: Emerging cyber-physical systems impel the development of communication protocols to efficiently utilize resources. This paper investigates the optimal co-design of control and scheduling in networked control systems. The objective is to co-design the control law and the scheduling mechanism that jointly optimize the tradeoff between regulation performance and communication resource consumption in the long run. The concept of the value of information (VoI) is employed to evaluate the importance of data being transmitted. The optimal solution includes a certainty equivalent control law and a stationary scheduling policy based on the VoI function. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling policy is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the property of the VoI function, we show that the optimal scheduling policy is symmetric and is a monotone function when the system matrix is diagonal. Moreover, by the diagonal system matrix assumption, the optimal scheduling policy is shown to be of threshold type. Then we provide a simplified yet equivalent form of the threshold-based optimal scheduling policy. The threshold value searching region is also given. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based estimation for partial differential equations</title>

Abstract: In systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations such as fluid flows, the design of state estimators such as Kalman filters relies on a reduced-order model (ROM) that projects the original high-dimensional dynamics onto a computationally tractable low-dimensional space. However, ROMs are prone to large errors, which negatively affects the performance of the estimator. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning reduced-order estimator (RL-ROE), a ROM-based estimator in which the correction term that takes in the measurements is given by a nonlinear policy trained through reinforcement learning. The nonlinearity of the policy enables the RL-ROE to compensate efficiently for errors of the ROM, while still taking advantage of the imperfect knowledge of the dynamics. Using examples involving the Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations, we show that in the limit of very few sensors, the trained RL-ROE outperforms a Kalman filter designed using the same ROM. Moreover, it yields accurate high-dimensional state estimates for trajectories corresponding to various physical parameter values, without direct knowledge of the latter.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Strategies for Probabilistic Voltage Envelopes under Network Contingencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an efficient data-driven method to construct probabilistic voltage envelopes (PVE) using power flow learning in grids with network contingencies. First, a network-aware Gaussian process (GP) termed Vertex-Degree Kernel (VDK-GP), developed in prior work, is used to estimate voltage-power functions for a few network configurations. The paper introduces a novel multi-task vertex degree kernel (MT-VDK) that amalgamates the learned VDK-GPs to determine power flows for unseen networks, with a significant reduction in the computational complexity and hyperparameter requirements compared to alternate approaches. Simulations on the IEEE 30-Bus network demonstrate the retention and transfer of power flow knowledge in both N-1 and N-2 contingency scenarios. The MT-VDK-GP approach achieves over 50% reduction in mean prediction error for novel N-1 contingency network configurations in low training data regimes (50-250 samples) over VDK-GP. Additionally, MT-VDK-GP outperforms a hyper-parameter based transfer learning approach in over 75% of N-2 contingency network structures, even without historical N-2 outage data. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to achieve PVEs using sixteen times fewer power flow solutions compared to Monte-Carlo sampling-based methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Unsupervised Learning Strategy for Monitoring Industrial Batch Processes</title>

Abstract: Industrial production processes, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, are complex systems that require continuous monitoring to ensure efficiency, product quality, and safety. This paper presents a hybrid unsupervised learning strategy (HULS) for monitoring complex industrial processes. Addressing the limitations of traditional Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), especially in scenarios with unbalanced data sets and highly correlated process variables, HULS combines existing unsupervised learning techniques to address these challenges. To evaluate the performance of the HULS concept, comparative experiments are performed based on a laboratory batch</description>

      <title>Network Learning with Directional Sign Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems can be effectively modeled via graphs that encode networked interactions, where relations between entities or nodes are often quantified by signed edge weights, e.g., promotion/inhibition in gene regulatory networks, or encoding political of friendship differences in social networks. However, it is often the case that only an aggregate consequence of such edge weights that characterize relations may be directly observable, as in protein expression of in gene regulatory networks. Thus, learning edge weights poses a significant challenge that is further exacerbated for intricate and large-scale networks. In this article, we address a model problem to determine the strength of sign-indefinite relations that explain marginal distributions that constitute our data. To this end, we develop a paradigm akin to that of the Schr\"odinger bridge problem and an efficient Sinkhorn type algorithm (more properly, Schr\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm) that allows fast convergence to parameters that minimize a relative entropy/likelihood criterion between the sought signed adjacency matrix and a prior. The formalism that we present represents a novel generalization of the earlier Schr\"odinger formalism in that marginal computations may incorporate weights that model directionality in underlying relations, and further, that it can be extended to high-order networks -- the Schr\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm that we derive is applicable all the same and allows geometric convergence to a sought sign-indefinite adjacency matrix or tensor, for high-order networks. We demonstrate our framework with synthetic and real-world examples.</description>
