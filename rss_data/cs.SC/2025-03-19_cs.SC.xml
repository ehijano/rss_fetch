      <title>LSU factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix LU factorization algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in linear algebra. We propose a generalization of the LU and LEU algorithms to accommodate the case of a commutative domain and its field of quotients. This algorithm decomposes any matrix A into a product of three matrices A=LSU, where each element of the triangular matrices L and U is a minor of matrix A. The number of non-zero elements in matrix S is equal to rank(A), and each of them is the inverse of the product of a specific pair of matrix A minors. The algorithm's complexity is equivalent to that of matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Positivity Proofs for Linear Recurrences with Several Dominant Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding the positivity of a sequence defined by a linear recurrence and initial conditions is, in general, a hard problem. When the coefficients of the recurrences are constants, decidability has only been proven up to order 5. The difficulty arises when the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence has several roots of maximal modulus, called dominant roots of the recurrence. We study the positivity problem for recurrences with polynomial coefficients, focusing on sequences of Poincar\'e type, which are perturbations of constant-coefficient recurrences. The dominant eigenvalues of a recurrence in this class are the dominant roots of the associated constant-coefficient recurrence. Previously, we have proved the decidability of positivity for recurrences having a unique, simple, dominant eigenvalue, under a genericity assumption. The associated algorithm proves positivity by constructing a positive cone contracted by the recurrence operator. We extend this cone-based approach to a larger class of recurrences, where a contracted cone may no longer exist. The main idea is to construct a sequence of cones. Each cone in this sequence is mapped by the recurrence operator to the next. This construction can be applied to prove positivity by induction. For recurrences with several simple dominant eigenvalues, we provide a condition that ensures that these successive inclusions hold. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method through examples, including recurrences with a double dominant eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Positivity sets of hinge functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate which subsets of the real plane are realisable as the set of points on which a one-layer ReLU neural network takes a positive value. In the case of cones we give a full characterisation of such sets. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for any subset of $\mathbb R^d$. We give various examples of such one-layer neural networks.</description>
