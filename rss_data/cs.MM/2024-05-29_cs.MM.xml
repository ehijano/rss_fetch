      <title>Hierarchical Action Recognition: A Contrastive Video-Language Approach with Hierarchical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video recognition remains an open challenge, requiring the identification of diverse content categories within videos. Mainstream approaches often perform flat classification, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchical structure relating categories. To address this, we formalize the novel task of hierarchical video recognition, and propose a video-language learning framework tailored for hierarchical recognition. Specifically, our framework encodes dependencies between hierarchical category levels, and applies a top-down constraint to filter recognition predictions. We further construct a new fine-grained dataset based on medical assessments for rehabilitation of stroke patients, serving as a challenging benchmark for hierarchical recognition. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for hierarchical recognition, significantly outperforming conventional methods, especially for fine-grained subcategories. The proposed framework paves the way for hierarchical modeling in video understanding tasks, moving beyond flat categorization.</description>

      <title>MMPareto: Boosting Multimodal Learning with Innocent Unimodal Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning methods with targeted unimodal learning objectives have exhibited their superior efficacy in alleviating the imbalanced multimodal learning problem. However, in this paper, we identify the previously ignored gradient conflict between multimodal and unimodal learning objectives, potentially misleading the unimodal encoder optimization. To well diminish these conflicts, we observe the discrepancy between multimodal loss and unimodal loss, where both gradient magnitude and covariance of the easier-to-learn multimodal loss are smaller than the unimodal one. With this property, we analyze Pareto integration under our multimodal scenario and propose MMPareto algorithm, which could ensure a final gradient with direction that is common to all learning objectives and enhanced magnitude to improve generalization, providing innocent unimodal assistance. Finally, experiments across multiple types of modalities and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction indicate our superior and extendable method performance. Our method is also expected to facilitate multi-task cases with a clear discrepancy in task difficulty, demonstrating its ideal scalability.

      <title>Discriminator-Guided Cooperative Diffusion for Joint Audio and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to construct an audio-video generative model with minimal computational cost by leveraging pre-trained single-modal generative models for audio and video. To achieve this, we propose a novel method that guides each single-modal model to cooperatively generate well-aligned samples across modalities. Specifically, given two pre-trained base diffusion models, we train a lightweight joint guidance module to adjust scores separately estimated by the base models to match the score of joint distribution over audio and video. We theoretically show that this guidance can be computed through the gradient of the optimal discriminator distinguishing real audio-video pairs from fake ones independently generated by the base models. On the basis of this analysis, we construct the joint guidance module by training this discriminator. Additionally, we adopt a loss function to make the gradient of the discriminator work as a noise estimator, as in standard diffusion models, stabilizing the gradient of the discriminator. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method improves both single-modal fidelity and multi-modal alignment with a relatively small number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18386v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.</description>

      <title>MF-AED-AEC: Speech Emotion Recognition by Leveraging Multimodal Fusion, Asr Error Detection, and Asr Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalent approach in speech emotion recognition (SER) involves integrating both audio and textual information to comprehensively identify the speaker's emotion, with the text generally obtained through automatic speech recognition (ASR). An essential issue of this approach is that ASR errors from the text modality can worsen the performance of SER. Previous studies have proposed using an auxiliary ASR error detection task to adaptively assign weights of each word in ASR hypotheses. However, this approach has limited improvement potential because it does not address the coherence of semantic information in the text. Additionally, the inherent heterogeneity of different modalities leads to distribution gaps between their representations, making their fusion challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we incorporate two auxiliary tasks, ASR error detection (AED) and ASR error correction (AEC), to enhance the semantic coherence of ASR text, and further introduce a novel multi-modal fusion (MF) method to learn shared representations across modalities. We refer to our method as MF-AED-AEC. Experimental results indicate that MF-AED-AEC significantly outperforms the baseline model by a margin of 4.1\%.</description>

      <title>ToonAging: Face Re-Aging upon Artistic Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</description>

      <title>MusicMagus: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation models have opened new avenues in musical creativity. However, music generation usually involves iterative refinements, and how to edit the generated music remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to the editing of music generated by such models, enabling the modification of specific attributes, such as genre, mood and instrument, while maintaining other aspects unchanged. Our method transforms text editing to \textit{latent space manipulation} while adding an extra constraint to enforce consistency. It seamlessly integrates with existing pretrained text-to-music diffusion models without requiring additional training. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over both zero-shot and certain supervised baselines in style and timbre transfer evaluations. Additionally, we showcase the practical applicability of our approach in real-world music editing scenarios.</description>

      <title>OpFlowTalker: Realistic and Natural Talking Face Generation via Optical Flow Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating realistic, natural, and lip-readable talking face videos remains a formidable challenge. Previous research primarily concentrated on generating and aligning single-frame images while overlooking the smoothness of frame-to-frame transitions and temporal dependencies. This often compromised visual quality and effects in practical settings, particularly when handling complex facial data and audio content, which frequently led to semantically incongruent visual illusions. Specifically, synthesized videos commonly featured disorganized lip movements, making them difficult to understand and recognize. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the application of optical flow to guide facial image generation, enhancing inter-frame continuity and semantic consistency. We propose "OpFlowTalker", a novel approach that utilizes predicted optical flow changes from audio inputs rather than direct image predictions. This method smooths image transitions and aligns changes with semantic content. Moreover, it employs a sequence fusion technique to replace the independent generation of single frames, thus preserving contextual information and maintaining temporal coherence. We also developed an optical flow synchronization module that regulates both full-face and lip movements, optimizing visual synthesis by balancing regional dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a Visual Text Consistency Score (VTCS) that accurately measures lip-readability in synthesized videos. Extensive empirical evidence validates the effectiveness of our approach.</description>
