      <title>Realisability and Complementability of Multiparty Session Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparty session types (MPST) are a type-based approach for specifying message-passing distributed systems. They rely on the notion of global type specifying the global behaviour and local types, which are the projections of the global behaviour onto each local participant. An essential property of global types is realisability, i.e., whether the composition of the local behaviours conforms to those specified by the global type. We explore how realisability of MPST relates to their complementability, i.e., whether there exists a global type that describes the complementary behaviour of the original global type. First, we show that if a global type is realisable with p2p communications, then it is realisable with synchronous communications. Second, we show that if a global type is realisable in the synchronous model, then it is complementable, in the sense that there exists a global type that describes the complementary behaviour of the original global type.  Third, we give an algorithm to decide whether a complementable global type, given with an explicit complement, is realisable in p2p. The algorithm is PSPACE in the size of the global type and its complement. As a side contribution, we propose a complementation construction for global types with sender-driven choice with a linear blowup in the size of the global type.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Rare-Event Reachability in Stochastic Vector Addition Systems via Affine Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events in Stochastic Vector Addition System (VAS) are of significant interest because, while extremely unlikely, they may represent undesirable behavior that can have adverse effects. Their low probabilities and potentially extremely large state spaces challenge existing probabilistic model checking and stochastic rare-event simulation techniques. In particular, in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), a chemical kinetic language often represented as VAS, rare event effects may be pathological. We present two novel heuristics for priority-first partial state space expansion and trace generation tuned to the transient analysis of rare-event probability in VAS: Iterative Subspace Reduction (ISR) and Single Distance Priority (SDP). Both methods construct a closed vector space containing all solution states. SDP then simply prioritizes shorter distances to this ``solution space'', while ISR constructs a set of nested subspaces, where short and highly-probable satisfying traces are likely to pass through in sequence. The resulting partial state graph from each method contains likely traces to rare-event states, allowing efficient probabilistic model checking to compute a lower-bound probability of a rare event of interest. These methods are deterministic, fast, and demonstrate marked performance on challenging CRN models.</description>

      <title>The Bright Side of Timed Opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timed automata (TAs) are an extension of finite automata that can measure and react to the passage of time, providing the ability to handle real-time constraints using clocks. In 2009, Franck Cassez showed that the timed opacity problem, where an attacker can observe some actions with their timestamps and attempts to deduce information, is undecidable for TAs. Moreover, he showed that the undecidability holds even for subclasses such as event-recording automata. In this article, we consider the same definition of opacity, by restricting either the system or the attacker. Our first contribution is to prove the inter-reducibility of two variants of opacity: full opacity (for which the observations should be the same regardless of the visit of a private location) and weak opacity (for which it suffices that the attacker cannot deduce whether the private location was visited, but for which it is harmless to deduce that it was not visited); we also prove further results including a connection with timed language inclusion. Our second contribution is to study opacity for several subclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of clocks, the number of actions, the nature of time, or a new subclass called observable event-recording automata. We show that opacity is mostly decidable in these cases, except for one-action TAs and for one-clock TAs with $\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability remains. Our third (and arguably main) contribution is to propose a new definition of opacity in which the number of observations made by the attacker is limited to the first $N$ observations, or to a set of $N$ timestamps after which the attacker observes the first action that follows immediately. This set can be defined either a priori or at runtime; all three versions yield decidability for the whole TA class.</description>
