      <title>Over-the-Air Transmission of Zak-OTFS on mmWave Communications Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication offers vast bandwidth for next-generation wireless systems but faces severe path loss, Doppler effects, and hardware impairments. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust waveform for high-mobility and doubly dispersive channels, outperforming OFDM under strong Doppler. However, the most studied multicarrier OTFS (MC-OTFS) is not easily predictable because the input-output (I$/$O) relation is not given by (twisted) convolution. Recently, the Zak-transform based OTFS (Zak-OTFS or OTFS 2$.$0) was proposed, which provides a single domain delay Doppler (DD) processing framework with predictable I$/$O behavior. This paper presents one of the first over-the-air (OTA) demonstrations of Zak-OTFS at mmWave frequencies. We design a complete Zak-OTFS based mmWave OTA system featuring root-raised-cosine (RRC) filtering for enhanced DD-domain predictability, higher-order modulations up to 16-QAM, and a low-overhead preamble for synchronization. A comprehensive signal model incorporating carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing impairments is developed, showing these effects can be jointly captured within the effective DD-domain channel. Experimental validation on the COSMOS testbed confirms the feasibility and robustness of Zak-OTFS under realistic mmWave conditions, highlighting its potential for efficient implementations in beyond-5G and 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Programming and Manifold Optimization for Reciprocal BD-RIS Scattering Matrix Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing the sum-rate performance of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided multi-user (MU)-multiple-input single-output (MISO) system using fractional programming (FP) techniques. More specifically, we leverage the Lagrangian Dual Transform (LDT) and Quadratic Transform (QT) to derive an equivalent objective function which is then solved iteratively via a manifold optimization framework. It is shown that these techniques reduce the complexity of the optimization problem for the scattering matrix solution, while also providing notable performance gains compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) methods under the same system conditions. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving sum-rate performance.</description>

      <title>A Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model for Generalized Power System Time-Series Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system time series analytics is critical in understanding the system operation conditions and predicting the future trends. Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic "mask-and-reconstruct" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution.</description>

      <title>Generative Decoding of Compressed CSI for MIMO Precoding Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems can enhance spectral and energy efficiency, but they require accurate channel state information (CSI), which becomes costly as the number of antennas increases. While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-based Frequency-Domain Watermarking for Energy System Time Series Data Asset Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data has been regarded as a valuable asset with the fast development of artificial intelligence technologies. In this paper, we introduce deep-learning neural network-based frequency-domain watermarking for protecting energy system time series data assets and secure data authenticity when being shared or traded across communities. First, the concept and desired watermarking characteristics are introduced. Second, a deep-learning neural network-based watermarking model with specially designed loss functions and network structure is proposed to embed watermarks into the original dataset. Third, a frequency-domain data preprocessing method is proposed to eliminate the frequency bias of neural networks when learning time series datasets to enhance the model performances. Last, a comprehensive watermarking performance evaluation framework is designed for measuring its invisibility, restorability, robustness, secrecy, false-positive detection, generalization, and capacity. Case studies based on practical load and photovoltaic time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>MA-Aided Hierarchical Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-User Wideband Beam Squint Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wideband near-field arrays, frequency-dependent array responses cause wavefronts at different frequencies to deviate from that at the center frequency, producing beam squint and degrading multi-user performance. True-time-delay (TTD) circuits can realign the frequency dependence but require large delay ranges and intricate calibration, limiting scalability. Another line of work explores one- and two-dimensional array geometries, including linear, circular, and concentric circular, that exhibit distinct broadband behaviors such as different beam-squint sensitivities and focusing characteristics. These observations motivate adapting the array layout to enable wideband-friendly focusing and enhance multi-user performance without TTD networks. We propose a movable antenna (MA) aided architecture based on hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming (HSC-HBF) in which antennas are grouped into tiles and only the tile centers are repositioned, providing slow geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping hardware and optimization complexity low. We show that the steering vector is inherently frequency dependent and that reconfiguring tile locations improves broadband focusing. Simulations across wideband near-field scenarios demonstrate robust squint suppression and consistent gains over fixed-layout arrays, achieving up to 5\% higher sum rate, with the maximum improvement exceeding 140\%.</description>

      <title>Conical Localization via Modified Polar Representation: A Unified Framework for Robust 3-D Positioning with 1-D Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for robust three-dimensional (3-D) source localization using a network of sensors equipped with one-dimensional (1-D) linear arrays. While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive BCIs: Enhancing Decoding Stability via User State-Aware EEG Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from limited robustness and poor long-term adaptability. Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.</description>

      <title>MA-enhanced Mixed Near-field and Far-field Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to employ a modular-based movable extremely large-scale array (XL-array) at Alice for enhancing covert communication performance. Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling Aware Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Multi-User mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme. Simulation results validate that the proposed method yields better performance than the MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.</description>

      <title>DMA-aided MU-MISO Systems for Power Splitting SWIPT via Lorentzian-Constrained Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Capacity Analysis of Joint Near and Far-Field Communication in 6G URLLC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G networks enables simultaneous near-field and far-field communications through extremely large antenna arrays and high carrier frequencies. While these regimes enhance spatial multiplexing and link capacity, their coexistence poses new challenges in ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for delay-sensitive applications. This paper presents an effective capacity (EC) analysis framework that jointly models near- and far-field communication regimes under distance estimation uncertainty. The user location is modeled as a random variable spanning both propagation regions, and tractable closed-form expression for the EC is derived to quantify delay performance. Numerical results illustrate the impact of estimation variance, QoS exponent, far-field boundary and near- field boundary (Fraunhofer distance) on EC performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation and MCS-based Intelligent Layering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous service classes in 5G Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) poses major challenges for meeting diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements under limited spectrum and power resources. Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Meets 6G and Beyond: Diffusion Models for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications mark a paradigm shift from bit-accurate transmission toward meaning-centric communication, essential as wireless systems approach theoretical capacity limits. The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond.</description>

      <title>Waveform-domain NOMA: An Enabler for ISAC in Uplink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the recent 3GPP decisions on 6G air interface, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms are the primary candidates for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Channel Estimation in MIMO OTFS Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently garnered attention due to its robustness in high-mobility wireless communication environments. In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects.</description>

      <title>MIMO Communications with 1-bit RIS: Asymptotic Analysis and Over-the-Air Channel Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems assisted by a 1-bit Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) under Ricean fading conditions. Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime.</description>

      <title>Nyquist Signaling Modulation (NSM): An FTN-Inspired Paradigm Shift in Modulation Design for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nyquist Signaling Modulations (NSMs) are a new signaling paradigm inspired by faster-than-Nyquist principles but based on a distinct approach that enables controlled inter-symbol interference through carefully designed finite-impulse-response filters. NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization on Graph-Structured Data via Gaussian Processes with Spectral Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</description>

      <title>Radar-APLANC: Unsupervised Radar-based Heartbeat Sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code, dataset, and supplementary materials can be accessed from https://github.com/RadarHRSensing/Radar-APLANC.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Downlink-Uplink Spectrum Sharing between Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.</description>

      <title>RAPTR: Radar-based 3D Pose Estimation using Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-pose-transformer.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Cluster-Triggered Encoding for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding static images into spike trains is a crucial step for enabling Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to process visual information efficiently. However, existing schemes such as rate coding, Poisson encoding, and time-to-first-spike (TTFS) often ignore spatial relationships and yield temporally inconsistent spike patterns. In this article, a novel cluster-based encoding approach is proposed, which leverages local density computation to preserve semantic structure in both spatial and temporal domains. This method introduces a 2D spatial cluster trigger that identifies foreground regions through connected component analysis and local density estimation. Then, extend to a 3D spatio-temporal (ST3D) framework that jointly considers temporal neighborhoods, producing spike trains with improved temporal consistency. Experiments on the N-MNIST dataset demonstrate that our ST3D encoder achieves 98.17% classification accuracy with a simple single-layer SNN, outperforming standard TTFS encoding (97.58%) and matching the performance of more complex deep architectures while using significantly fewer spikes (~3800 vs ~5000 per sample). The results demonstrate that this approach provides an interpretable and efficient encoding strategy for neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring including photoplethysmography (PPG) provides non-invasive cardiac and respiratory measurements, yet motion artefacts (MAs) during physical activity degrade its signal quality and downstream estimation concurrently. An attention-mechanism-based generative adversarial network (AM-GAN) was proposed to model motion artefacts and mitigate their impact on raw PPG signals. The AM-GAN learns how to transform motion-affected PPG into artefact-reduced waveforms to align with triaxial acceleration signals corresponding to artefact components gained from a triaxial accelerometer. The AM-GAN has been validated across four experimental protocols with 43 participants performing activities from low to high intensity (6--12km/h). With the public datasets, the AM-GAN achieves mean absolute error (MAE) for heart rate (HR) of 1.81 beats/min on IEEE-SPC and 3.86 beats/min on PPGDalia. On the in-house LU dataset, it shows the MAEs &lt; 1.37 beats/min for HR and 2.49 breaths/min for respiratory rate (RR). A further in-house C2 dataset with three oxygen levels (16%, 18%, and 21%) was applied in the AM-GAN to attain a MAE of 1.65% for SpO2. The outcome demonstrates that the AM-GAN offers a robust and reliable physiological estimation under various intensities of physical activity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Symbol Digital AirComp via Modulation Design and Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the superposition property of wireless channels to enable efficient function computation over a multiple access channel (MAC). However, existing digital AirComp methods either rely on single-symbol modulation, which limits flexibility and robustness, or on multi-symbol extensions that suffer from high complexity or approximation errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new multi-symbol modulation framework, termed sequential modulation for AirComp (SeMAC), which encodes each input into a sequence of symbols with distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time slots. This approach increases design flexibility and robustness against channel noise. Specifically, the modulation design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and efficiently solved through a successive convex approximation (SCA) combined with stochastic subgradient descent (SSD). For fixed modulation formats, we further develop SeMAC with power adaptation (SeMAC-PA) to adjusts transmit power and phase while preserving the modulation structure. Notably, numerical results show that SeMAC improves computation accuracy by up to 14 dB compared to the existing methods for computing nonlinear functions such as the product function.</description>

      <title>Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02673</link>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.</description>

      <title>Well-Designed k-Space Coverage is Important for Good MRI Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object: Modern computational MRI denoising approaches are often designed assuming fixed k-space coverage. This contrasts with earlier acquisition-design literature that leveraged k-space coverage modifications (e.g., reducing spatial resolution) to improve SNR. This work investigates whether the performance of modern computational denoising methods can be further enhanced by k-space coverage modifications.
  Materials and Methods: Using realistic simulations of noisy data, k-space coverage and averaging patterns were optimized for two advanced image denoising/reconstruction approaches: parallel imaging with total variation regularization and a U-Net neural network. For reference, comparisons against classical linear filtering/apodization methods were also performed. Performance was quantified using normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics.
  Results: Advanced computational denoising methods can be substantially enhanced, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by reducing the spatial resolution of the acquisition to improve SNR. Indeed, even simple linear filtering/apodization with optimized k-space coverage can rival advanced methods using naive higher-resolution coverage.
  Discussion: Classical acquisition design principles that allow spatial resolution to be traded for SNR enhancement are still very relevant for modern computational denoising techniques. However, the optimization of k-space coverage and denoising/reconstruction methods can also be somewhat confounded because the NRMSE and SSIM metrics have low sensitivity to spatial resolution.</description>
