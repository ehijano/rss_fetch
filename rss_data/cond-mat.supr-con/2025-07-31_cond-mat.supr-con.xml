      <title>Persistent spin currents in superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors are famously capable of supporting persistent electrical currents, that is, currents that flow without any measurable decay as long as the material is kept in the superconducting state. We introduce here a class of materials -- superconducting altermagnets -- that can both generate and carry persistent {\em spin} currents. This includes spin-polarized electrical supercurrent as well as pure spin supercurrent that facilitates spin transport in the absence of any charge transport. A key to this remarkable property is the realization that the leading superconducting instability of altermagnetic metals consists of two independent condensates formed of spin-up and spin-down electrons. In the non-relativistic limit the two condensates are decoupled and can thus naturally support persistent currents with any spin polarization, including pure spin supercurrents realized in the charge counterflow regime. We describe a novel ``spin-current dynamo effect'' that can be used to generate pure spin supercurrent in such systems by driving a charge current along certain crystallographic directions. Away from the non-relativistic limit, when spin-orbit interactions and magnetic disorder are present, we find that the spin current generically develops spatial oscillations but, importantly, no dissipation or decay. This is in stark contrast to spin currents in normal diffusive metals which tend to decay on relatively short lengthscales. We illustrate the above properties by performing model calculations relevant to two distinct classes of altermagnets and various device geometries.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of microstructured devices of the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn5 for investigations of isolated grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&amp;$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Excitations of a Half-Filled Tl-based Cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Superconducting Solitons by Terahertz-Light-Driven Persistent Pseudo-Spin Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the decoherence bottleneck remains a central challenge for advancing coherent superconducting quantum device and information technologies. Solitons -- non-dispersive wave packets stabilized by the collective synchronization of quantum excitations -- offer a robust pathway to mitigating dephasing, yet their realization in superconductors has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the observation of a driven soliton state in epitaxial thin films of an iron-based superconductor (Co-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$), induced by intense, multi-cycle terahertz (THz) periodic driving. The dynamical transition to this soliton state is marked by the emergence of Floquet-like spectral sidebands that exhibit a strongly nonlinear dependence on THz laser field strength and a resonant enhancement with temperature. Quantum kinetic simulations corroborate these observations, allowing us to underpin the emergence of synchronized Anderson pseudo-spin oscillations -- analogous to Dicke superradiance -- mediated by persistent order parameter oscillations. In this coherently driven state, the observed sidebands result from difference-frequency mixing between the THz drive and persistent soliton dynamics. These findings establish a robust framework for coherently driving and controlling superconducting soliton time-crystal-like phases using low dissipation, time-periodic THz fields, enabling prospects for THz-speed quantum gate operations, long-lived quantum memory, and robust quantum sensing based on enhanced macroscopic pseudo-spin coherence.</description>

      <title>Vortex Refraction at Tilted Superconductor-Normal Metal Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a refraction law for superconducting vortices at superconductor/normal metal interfaces. Simulations of the proximity effect under tilted geometries confirm this law and reveal vortex trapping for low effective mass. Under transport currents, we find core displacements due to differing vortex viscosities in the superconductor and normal metal. These results clarify vortex dynamics in proximity-coupled systems and offer design principles for high-current coated superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses are shown to contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that second harmonic generation is a necessary and sufficient condition for the symmetry breaking. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments and show that strong nonlinear driving allows to induce dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Vortex Pinning in Niobium covered by a thin polycrystalline Gold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its superconducting properties, Niobium (Nb) is an excellent candidate material for superconducting electronics and applications in quantum technology. Here we perform scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on Nb films covered by a thin gold (Au) film. We investigate the minigap structure of the proximitized region and provide evidence for a highly transparent interface between Nb and Au, beneficial for device applications. Imaging of Abrikosov vortices in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is reported. The data show vortex pinning by the granular structure of the polycrystalline Au film. Our results show robust and homogeneous superconducting properties of thin Nb film in the presence of a gold capping layer. The Au film not only protects the Nb from surface oxidation but also preserves its excellent superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>2D CFT and efficient Bethe ansatz for exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin integrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and quantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the Richardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a proof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and their generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this foundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this approach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are embedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate conformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class, we develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in the Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix eigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid Newton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical applications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and reveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex rapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to finite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing energies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete Richardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe equations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of Virasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct minimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy; revisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous presence of polarity and metallicity or superconductivity in a material signifies the exotic polar metallic or superconducting (SC) state, while such materials are extremely rare due to their exclusive nature. Recently, the interweaved CDW and antipolar charge orders have been discovered in a metallic superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 (ATS), while their interplay and competition with the following emergent SC state remains elusive. Here, we report a further experimental investigation of the SC state emerged from the preformed CDW and antipolar order states using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in combination with transport and Raman measurements. The temperature-dependent pre-formation and condensation of Cooper pairs are experimentally identified. The pre-existent CDW is gradually suppressed by the preformed Cooper pairs, and then the antipolar charge order is spatially suppressed into a ferrielectric-like polar order by the condensed Cooper pairs of SC state. The exotic charge-polarized superconducting state is discovered in the polar metal of ATS, suggesting a valuable platform for the exploration of intriguing polar superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Effective perpendicular electric field as a probe for interlayer pairing in ambient-pressure superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films have revealed a superconducting gap near the diagonal direction for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, confined to a narrow momentum region. Our numerical calculations indicate that interlayer pairing is dominant, resulting in an $s_\pm$-wave symmetry. We propose employing perpendicular electric fields, a practical method in thin film systems, to verify the pairing symmetry. Our calculations predict that such fields will induce Fermi arcs or nodal points and significantly modulate the gap near the diagonal, with the modulated region overlapping the area probed by ARPES. This approach provides an effective tool for probing pairing symmetry in bilayer nickelate thin films, especially given current limitations in experimental techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides is a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, hosting exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, recent experimental results on HgS reports a new superconducting phase at 21 GPa, whose origin is unknown. In this letter we theoretically investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and the emergence of superconductivity in the rock salt phase. Remarkably, we discover that the rock salt phase hosts a two-gap superconducting phase originating from distinct Fermi surfaces. The unusually high critical temperature of 11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic approximation. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconductivity is observed.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>
