      <title>The integer $\{2\}$-domination number of grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $m$ and $n$, the grid graph $G_{m,n}$ is the Cartesian product of the path graph $P_m$ on $m$ vertices and the path graph $P_n$ on $n$ vertices. An integer $\{2\}$-dominating function of a graph is a mapping from the vertex set to $\{0,1,2\}$ such that the sum of the mapped values of each vertex and its neighbors is at least $2$; the integer $\{2\}$-domination number of a graph is defined to be the minimum sum of mapped values of all vertices among all integer $\{2\}$-dominating functions. In this paper, we compute the integer $\{2\}$-domination numbers of $G_{1,n}$ and $G_{2,n}$, attain an upper bound to the integer $\{2\}$-domination numbers of $G_{3,n}$, and propose an algorithm to count the integer $\{2\}$-domination numbers of $G_{m,n}$ for arbitrary $m$ and $n$. As a future work, we list the integer $\{2\}$-domination numbers of $G_{4,n}$ for small $n$, and conjecture on its formula.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Erd\H{o}s-S\'os Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge colored graph is said to contain rainbow-$F$ if $F$ is a subgraph and every edge receives a different color. In 2007, Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov, and Verstra\"ete introduced the \emph{rainbow extremal number} $\mathrm{ex}^*(n,F)$, a variant on the classical Tur\'an problem, asking for the maximum number of edges in a $n$-vertex properly edge-colored graph which does not contain a rainbow-$F$. In the following years many authors have studied the asymptotic behavior of $\mathrm{ex}^*(n,F)$ when $F$ is bipartite. In the particular case that $F$ is a tree $T$, the infamous Erd\"os-S\'os conjecture says that the extremal number of $T$ depends only on the size of $T$ and not its structure. After observing that such a pattern cannot hold for $\mathrm{ex}^*$ in the usual setting, we propose that the relative rainbow extremal number $\mathrm{ex}^*(Q_n,T)$ in the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ will satisfy an Erd\"os-S\'os type Conjecture and verify it for some infinite families of trees $T$.</description>

      <title>Construction Techniques for Linear Realizations of Multisets with Small Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian path in the complete graph $K_v$ whose vertices are labeled with the integers $0,1,\ldots,v-1$ is a linear realization for the multiset $L$ of the linear edge-lengths (given by $|x-y|$ for the edge between vertices $x$ and $y$) of the edges in the path. A linear realization is standard if an end-vertex is 0 and perfect if the end-vertices are 0 and $v-1$.
  Linear realizations are useful in the study of the Buratti-Horak-Rosa (BHR) Conjecture on the existence of cyclic realizations (where cyclic edge-lengths are given by distance modulo $v$) for given multisets. In this paper, we focus on multisets of the form $\{1^a, (y-k)^b, y^c\}$.
  Using core perfect linear realizations for supports of size 2 (which have the forms $\{x^{y-1},y^{x+1}\}$ whenever $\gcd(x,y)=1$), we construct standard linear realizations (with $a=k-1$, $b=j(y-k)$, $c=jy$) when $k\mid y$ or $k \leq 4$. When $k=2$, these allow us to show that there is a linear realization whenever $a \geq y$. This is in line with the known results for the case of $k=1$. We also supplement these results for $k=1$ by constructing linear realizations whenever $b+c &lt; y$ and $a \geq y - \min(b,c)$, from which the coprime version of the BHR Conjecture (requiring that $v$ is coprime with each element of the multiset) follows for $k=1$ when $y \leq 16$.
  Our methods show promise for constructing linear realizations for arbitrary $k$, in the direction of a resolution of the BHR Conjecture for supports of size 3.</description>

      <title>Settling the no-$(k+1)$-in-line problem when $k$ is not small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the maximum number of points that can be selected from an $n \times n$ square lattice such that no $k+1$ of them are in a line? This has been asked more than $100$ years ago for $k=2$ and it remained wide open ever since. In this paper, we prove the precise answer is $kn$, provided that $k&gt;C\sqrt{n\log{n}}$ for an absolute constant $C$. The proof relies on carefully constructed bi-uniform random bipartite graphs and concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Sieving of Multisets with Bounded Multiplicity and the Frobenius Coin Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two subjects in the title are related via the specialization of symmetric polynomials at roots of unity. Let $f(z_1,\ldots,z_n)\in\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\ldots,z_n]$ be a symmetric polynomial with integer coefficients and let $\omega$ be a primitive $d$th root of unity. If $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ then we have $f(1,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})\in\mathbb{Z}$. If $d|n$ then of course we have $f(\omega,\ldots,\omega^n)=f(1,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})\in\mathbb{Z}$, but when $d|(n+1)$ we also have $f(\omega,\ldots,\omega^n)\in\mathbb{Z}$. We investigate these three families of integers in the case $f=h_k^{(b)}$, where $h_k^{(b)}$ is the coefficient of $t^k$ in the generating function $\prod_{i=1}^n (1+z_it+\cdots+(z_it)^{b-1})$. These polynomials were previously considered by several authors. They interpolate between the elementary symmetric polynomials ($b$=2) and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ($b\to\infty$). When $\gcd(b,d)=1$ with $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}=(1,\omega,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})$ are related to cyclic sieving of multisets with multiplicities bounded above by $b$, generalizing the well know cyclic sieving results for sets ($b=2$) and multisets ($b\to \infty$). When $\gcd(b,d)=1$ and $d|(n+1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}(\omega,\omega^2,\ldots,\omega^n)$ are related to the Frobenius coin problem with two coins. The case $\gcd(b,d)\neq 1$ is more complicated. At the end of the paper we combine these results with the expansion of $h_k^{(b)}$ in various bases of the ring of symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sufficient Conditions for Graph Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor of a graph is a spanning subgraph whose each component is an element of $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$. In this paper, through the graph spectral methods, we establish the lower bound of the signless Laplacian spectral radius and the upper bound of the distance spectral radius to determine whether a graph admits a $\{K_2\}$-factor. We get a lower bound on the size (resp. the spectral radius) of $G$ to guarantee that $G$ contains a $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor. Then we determine an upper bound on the distance spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ has a $\{K_{1,1}, K_{1,2},C_m: m\geq3\}$-factor. Furthermore, by constructing extremal graphs, we show that the above all bounds are best possible.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality of spin $q$-Whittaker polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous spin $q$-Whittaker polynomials are a family of symmetric polynomials which generalize the Macdonald polynomials at $t=0$. In this paper we prove that they are orthogonal with respect to a variant of the Sklyanin measure on the $n$ dimensional torus and as a result they form a basis of the space of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. Instrumental to the proof are inhomogeneous eigenrelations, which partially generalize those of Macdonald polynomials. We also consider several special cases of the inhomogeneous spin $q$-Whittaker polynomials, which include variants of symmetric Grothendieck polynomials or spin Whittaker functions.</description>

      <title>P\'osa rotation through a random permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What minimum degree of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices guarantees that the union of $G$ and a random $2$-factor (or permutation) is with high probability Hamiltonian? Gir\~ao and Espuny D{\'\i}az showed that the answer lies in the interval $[\tfrac15 \log n, n^{3/4+o(1)}]$. We improve both the upper and lower bounds to resolve this problem asymptotically, showing that the answer is $(1+o(1))\sqrt{n\log n/2}$. Furthermore, if $G$ is assumed to be (nearly) regular then we obtain the much stronger bound that any degree growing at least polylogarithmically in $n$ is sufficient for Hamiltonicity. Our proofs use some insights from the rich theory of random permutations and a randomised version of the classical technique of P\'osa rotation adapted to multiple exposure arguments.</description>

      <title>Preorder induced by rainbow forbidden subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subgraph $H$ of an edge-colored graph $G$ is rainbow if all the edges of $H$ receive different colors. If $G$ does not contain a rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $H$, we say that $G$ is rainbow $H$-free. For connected graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, if every rainbow $H_1$-free edge-colored complete graph colored in sufficiently many colors is rainbow $H_2$-free, we write $H_1\le H_2$. The binary relation $\le$ is reflexive and transitive, and hence it is a preorder. If $H_1$ is a subgraph of $H_2$, then trivially $H_1\le H_2$ holds. On the other hand, there exists a pair $(H_1, H_2)$ such that $H_1$ is a proper supergraph of $H_2$ and $H_1\le H_2$ holds. Cui et al.~[Discrete Math.~\textbf{344} (2021) Article Number 112267] characterized these pairs. In this paper, we investigate the pairs $(H_1, H_2)$ with $H_1\le H_2$ when neither $H_1$ nor $H_2$ is a subgraph of the other. We prove that there are many such pairs and investigate their structure with respect to $\le$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study point-line configurations, their minimal matroids, and their associated circuit varieties. We present an algorithm for identifying the minimal matroids of these configurations with respect to dependency order, or equivalently, the maximal matroids with respect to weak order, and use it to determine the irreducible decomposition of their corresponding circuit varieties. Our algorithm is applied to several classical configurations, including the Fano matroid, affine plane of order three, MacLane, and Pappus configurations. Additionally, we explore the connection to a conjecture by Jackson and Tanigawa, which provides a criterion for the uniqueness of the minimal matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $(r+1)$-completed cycles $k$-leaky Hurwitz numbers and prove piecewise polynomiality as well as establishing their chamber polynomiality structure and their wall crossing formulae. For $k=0$ the results recover previous results of Shadrin-Spitz-Zvonkine. The specialization for $r=1$ recovers Hurwitz numbers that are close to the ones studied by Cavalieri-Markwig-Ranganathan and Cavalieri-Markwig-Schmitt. The ramifications differ by a lower order torus correction, natural from the Fock space perspective, not affecting the genus zero enumeration, nor the enumeration for leaky parameter values $k = \pm 1$ in all genera.</description>

      <title>Partitions of an Eulerian Digraph into Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cancellation property satisfied by an Eulerian digraph $D$. Namely, unless $D$ is a single directed cycle, we have $\sum_{t\geq 1} (-1)^{t} |\mathfrak{C}_{t}(D)| =0 $, where $\mathfrak{C}_{t}(D)$ is the set of partitions of Eulerian circuits of $D$ into $t$ circuits. To show this, we utilize Viennot's theory of Heaps of Pieces, and in particular, the bijection between closed walks of a digraph and heaps with a unique maximal piece.
  We consider the partition lattice of the edge-set of a digraph $D$, restricted to the join-semilattice $T(D)$ induced by elements whose blocks are Eulerian. The up-set of a minimal element $a\in T(D)$ is shown to be isomorphic to the bond lattice $L(G)$ of the intersection graph $G$ of cycles of $D$. Tools developed by Whitney and Rota for the calculation of the M\"{o}bius function of the bond lattice allow us to proceed by induction on the number of edges of $D$. In the process, we use the equivalence between heaps with a fixed maximal piece and unique sink orientations of the bond lattice $L(G)$.
  Finally, we apply the aforementioned cancellation property in order to deduce the classical Harary-Sachs Theorem for graphs of rank $2$ from a hypergraph generalization thereof, remedying a gap in a previous proof of this.</description>

      <title>Representation Number of Word-Representable Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The word-representability of split graphs was studied in a series of papers in the literature, and the class of word-representable split graphs was characterized through semi-transitive orientation. Nonetheless, the representation number of this class of graphs is still not known. In general, determining the representation number of a word-representable graph is an NP-complete problem. In this work, through an algorithmic procedure, we show that the representation number of the class of word-representable split graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of word-representable split graphs as well as the class of split comparability graphs which have representation number exactly three.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to tree-length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graph parameters are said to be coarsely equivalent if they are within constant factors from each other for every graph $G$. Recently, several graph parameters were shown to be coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Recall that the length of a tree-decomposition ${\cal T}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal T}(G)$, and the tree-length of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all tree-decompositions of $G$. We present simpler and sometimes with better bounds proofs for those known in literature results and further extend this list of graph parameters coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Among other new results, we show that the tree-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if for every bramble ${\cal F}$ (or every Helly family of connected subgraphs ${\cal F}$, or every Helly family of paths ${\cal F}$) of $G$, there is a disk in $G$ with small radius that intercepts all members of ${\cal F}$. Furthermore, the tree-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if $G$ can be embedded with a small additive distortion to an unweighted tree with the same vertex set as in $G$ (not involving any Steiner points). Additionally, we introduce a new natural "bridging`` property for cycles, which generalizes a known property of cycles in chordal graphs, and show that it also coarsely defines the tree-length.</description>

      <title>A Note On Rainbow 4-Term Arithmetic Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let [n]=\{1,\,2,...,\,n\} be colored in k colors. A rainbow AP(k) in [n] is a k term arithmetic progression whose elements have diferent colors. Conlon, Jungic and Radoicic [10] had shown that there exists an equinumerous 4-coloring of [4n] which happens to be rainbow AP(4) free, when n is even and subsequently Haghighi and Nowbandegani [7] shown that such a coloring of [4n] also exists when n&gt;1 is odd. Based on their construction, we shown that a balanced 4-coloring of [n] ( i.e. size of each color class is at least \left\lfloor n/4\right\rfloor ) actually exists for all natural number n. Further we established that for nonnegative integers k\geq3 and n&gt;1, every balanced k-coloring of [kn+r] with 0\leq r&lt;k-1, contains a rainbow AP(k) if and only if k=3. In this paper we also have discussed about rainbow free equinumerous 4-coloring of \mathbb{Z}_{n}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The web permutations were introduced by Hwang, Jang and Oh to interpret the entries of the transition matrix between the Specht and $\mathrm{SL}_2$-web bases of the irreducible $\S_{2n}$-representation indexed by $(n,n)$. They conjectured that certain classes of web permutations are enumerated by the Seidel triangle. Using generating functions, Xu and Zeng showed that enumerating web permutations by the number of drops, fixed points and cycles gives rise to the normalized $\gamma$-coefficients of the $(\alpha,t)$-Eulerian polynomials. They posed the problems to prove their result combinatorially and to find an interpretation of the normalized $\gamma$-coefficients in terms of cycle-up-down permutations. In this work, we prove the enumerative conjecture of Hwang-Jang-Oh and answer the two open problems proposed by Xu and Zeng.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G$, the derangement graph of $G$ is defined with vertex set $G$, where two elements $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy^{-1}$ is a derangement. We establish that, if $G$ is transitive with degree exceeding 30, then the derangement graph of $G$ contains a complete subgraph with four vertices.
  As a consequence, if $G$ is a normal subgroup of $A$ such that $|A : G| = 3$, and if $U$ is a subgroup of $G$ satisfying $G = \bigcup_{a \in A} U^a$, then $|G : U| \leq 10$. This result provides support for a conjecture by Neumann and Praeger concerning Kronecker classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz et al. proved that every $6$-edge-connected graph has a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. In fact, they proved a more technical statement which says that there exists a nowhere zero $3$-flow that extends the flow prescribed on the incident edges of a single vertex $z$ with bounded degree. We extend this theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al. to allow $z$ to have arbitrary degree, but with the additional assumption that there is another vertex $x$ with large degree and no small cut separating $x$ and $z$. Using this theorem, we prove two results regarding the generation of minimal graphs with the property that prescribing the edges incident to a vertex with specific flow does not extend to a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. We use this to further strengthen the theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al., as well as make progress on a conjecture of Li et al.</description>

      <title>The Polytope of Probability Functions on a Finite Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01604v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kim, Kim, and Neggers (2019) defined probability functions on a poset, by listing some very natural conditions that a function \(\pi: P \times P \to [0,1]\) should satisfy in order to capture the intuition of "the likelihood that \(a\) precedes \(b\) in \(P\)". In particular, this generalizes the common notion of poset probability for finite posets, where \(\pi(a,b)\) is the proportion of linear extensions of \(P\) in which \(a\) precedes \(b\).
  They constructed a family of such functions for posets embedded in the ordered plane; that is two say, for posets of order dimension at most two.
  We study probability functions of a finite poset \(P\) by constructing an ancillary poset \(\tilde{P}\), that we call *probability functions posets*. The relations of this new poset encodes the restrictions imposed on probability functions of the original poset by the conditions of the definition. Then, we define the probability functions polytope, which parameterizes the probability functions on \(P\), and show that it can be realized as the order polytope of \(\tilde{P}\) intersected by a certain affine subspace.
  We give a partial description of the vertices of probability functions polytope and show that, in contrast to the order polytope, it is not always a lattice polytope.</description>

      <title>Minimum degree edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in random directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of finding ``as many edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles as possible'' in the binomial random digraph $D_{n,p}$. We show that a typical $D_{n,p}$ contains precisely the minimum between the minimum out- and in-degrees many edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles, given that $p\geq \log^{15} n/n$, which is optimal up to a factor of poly$\log n$.
  Our proof provides a randomized algorithm to generate the cycles and uses a novel idea of generating $D_{n,p}$ in a sophisticated way that enables us to control some key properties, and on an ``online sprinkling'' idea as was introduced by Ferber and Vu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Roller Coaster Theorem from graph theory, we prove the existence of artinian Gorenstein algebras with unconstrained Hilbert series, which we call Roller Coaster algebras. Our construction relies on Nagata idealization of quadratic monomial algebras defined by whiskered graphs. The monomial algebras are interesting in their own right, as our results suggest that artinian level algebras defined by quadratic monomial ideals rarely have the weak Lefschetz property. In addition, we discover a large family of G-quadratic Gorenstein algebras failing the weak Lefschetz property.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic $(m,n)$-Parking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish new results on the probabilistic parking model (introduced by Durm\'ic, Han, Harris, Ribeiro, and Yin) with $m$ cars and $n$ parking spots and probability parameter $p\in[0,1]$. For any $ m \leq n$ and $p \in [0,1]$, we study the parking preference of the last car, denoted $a_m$, and determine the conditional distribution of $a_m$ and compute its expected value. We show that both formulas depict explicit dependence on the probability parameter $p$. We study the case where $m = cn $ for some $ 0 &lt; c &lt; 1 $ and investigate the asymptotic behavior and show that the presence of ``extra spots'' on the street significantly affects the rate at which the conditional distribution of $ a_m $ converges to the uniform distribution on $[n]$. Even for small $ \varepsilon = 1 - c $, an $ \varepsilon $-proportion of extra spots reduces the convergence rate from $ 1/\sqrt{n} $ to $ 1/n $ when $ p \neq 1/2 $. Additionally, we examine how the convergence rate depends on $c$, while keeping $n$ and $p$ fixed. We establish that as $c$ approaches zero, the total variation distance between the conditional distribution of $a_m$ and the uniform distribution on $[n]$ decreases at least linearly in $c$.</description>

      <title>A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment model on $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et al.~\cite{bet2023detecting} show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Kaddouri et al.~\cite{kaddouri2024impossibility} make a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively, proving that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Furthermore, we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$ is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et al.~\cite{bhamidi2018change} is order-optimal.</description>

      <title>Almost All Transverse-Free Plane Curves Are Trivially Transverse-Free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Call a curve $C \subset \mathbb{P}^2$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ transverse-free if every line over $\mathbb{F}_q$ intersects $C$ at some closed point with multiplicity at least 2. In 2004, Poonen used a notion of density to treat Bertini Theorems over finite fields. In this paper we develop methods for density computation and apply them to estimate the density of the set of polynomials defining transverse-free curves. In order to do so, we use a combinatorial approach based on blocking sets of $\operatorname{PG}(2, q)$ and prove an upper bound on the number of such sets of fixed size $&lt; 2q$. We thus obtain that nearly all transverse-free curves contain singularities at every $\mathbb{F}_q$-point of some line.</description>

      <title>DG-Sensitive Pruning &amp; a Complete Classification of DG Trees and Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a squarefree monomial ideal $I$ of a polynomial ring $Q$, we show that if the minimal free resolution $\mathbb{F}$ of $Q/I$ admits the structure of a differential graded (dg) algebra, then so does any "pruning" of $\mathbb{F}$. As an application, we show that if $Q/\mathcal{F}(\Delta)$, the quotient of the ambient polynomial ring by the facet ideal $\mathcal{F}(\Delta)$ of a simplicial complex $\Delta$, is minimally resolved by a dg algebra, then so is the quotient by the facet ideal of each facet-induced subcomplex of $\Delta$ (over the smaller polynomial ring). Along with techniques from discrete Morse theory and homological algebra, this allows us to give complete classifications of the trees and cycles $G$ with $Q/I_G$ minimally resolved by a dg algebra in terms of the diameter of $G$, where $I_G$ is the edge ideal of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph with independent identically distributed edge processes. Our aim is to describe the joint evolution of the entries of a subgraph count vector. The main result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem: we establish, under an appropriate centering and scaling, the joint functional convergence of the vector of subgraph counts to a specific multidimensional Gaussian process. The result holds under mild assumptions on the edge processes, most notably a Lipschitz-type condition.</description>

      <title>Reductions in local certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where a prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small piece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then decide whether the property $\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their certificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property $\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the optimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\mathcal{P}$, which can be viewed a measure of the local complexity of $\mathcal{P}$.
  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the certificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have been a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for general graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the certificates are usually very problem-dependent.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local certification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates for a property $\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property $\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain polynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the structure of the Laplace characteristic polynomial $\chi_n(\lambda)$ for the infinite family of graphs $H_n=H_n(G_1,\,G_2,\ldots,G_m)$ obtained as a circulant foliation over a graph $H$ on $m$ vertices with fibers $G_1,\,G_2,\ldots,G_m.$ Each fiber $G_i=C_n(s_{i,1},\,s_{i,2},\ldots,s_{i,k_i})$ of this foliation is the circulant graph on $n$ vertices with jumps $s_{i,1},\,s_{i,2},\ldots,s_{i,k_i}.$ This family includes the family of generalized Petersen graphs, $I$-graphs, sandwiches of circulant graphs, discrete torus graphs and others. We show that the characteristic polynomial for such graphs can be decomposed into a finite product of algebraic functions evaluated at the roots of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. Also, we prove that the characteristic polynomial can be represented in the form $\chi_n(\lambda)=p(\lambda)\,\chi_H(\lambda)a(n)^2,$ where $a(n)$ is a sequence of integer polynomials and $p(\lambda)$ is a prescribed integer polynomial. Moreover, we use the obtained results to produce analytic formulas for spectral graph invariants, such as the number of spanning trees and the number of spanning rooted forests.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial aspects of Parraud's asymptotic expansion for GUE matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new combinatorial proof of Parraud's formula for the asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N^2$ for the expected trace of polynomials of several independent $N \times N$ GUE matrices, which expresses the result using a mixture of free difference quotients, introducing new freely independent semicircular variables, and integration with respect to parameters. Our approach streamlines the statement of the formula while clarifying its relationship to the combinatorial genus expansion.</description>

      <title>Stability of graph pairs involving cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called stable if $\aut(\Gamma)\times\aut(\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\aut(\Gamma\times\Sigma)$ and unstable otherwise, where $\Gamma\times\Sigma$ is the direct product of $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$. A graph is called $R$-thin if distinct vertices have different neighbourhoods. $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are said to be coprime if there is no nontrivial graph $\Delta$ such that $\Gamma \cong \Gamma_1 \times \Delta$ and $\Sigma \cong \Sigma_1 \times \Delta$ for some graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Sigma_1$. An unstable graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called nontrivially unstable if $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $R$-thin connected coprime graphs and at least one of them is non-bipartite. This paper contributes to the study of the stability of graph pairs with a focus on the case when $\Sigma = C_n$ is a cycle. We give two sufficient conditions for $(\Gamma, C_n)$ to be nontrivially unstable, where $n \ne 4$ and $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph. In the case when $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected non-bipartite graph, we obtain the following results: (i) if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is unstable for every even integer $n \geq 4$; (ii) if an even integer $n \ge 6$ is compatible with $\Gamma$ in some sense, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable if and only if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable; (iii) if there is an even integer $n \ge 6$ compatible with $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{m})$ is unstable for all even integers $m \ge 6$. We also prove that if $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph and $n \ge 3$ is an odd integer compatible with $\Gamma$, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is stable.</description>

Abstract: A set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-large if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions $a,a+d,...,a+(k-1)d$ with gap $d \in D$. Closely related to largeness is accessibility; a set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-accessible if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic sequences $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ with $x_{i+1}-x_{i} \in D$. It is known that if $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is $2$-large, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow exponentially. In this paper, we show that if $D$ is $2$-accessible, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow much faster than exponentially.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Palette Sparsification from Variable Lists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the following holds for each $\varepsilon &gt;0$. For $G$ an $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $D$, lists $S_v$ of size $D+1$ (for $v\in V(G)$), and $L_v$ chosen uniformly from the ($(1+\varepsilon)\ln n$)-subsets of $S_v$ (independent of other choices), \[ \mbox{$G$ admits a proper coloring $\sigma$ with $\sigma_v\in L_v$ $\forall v$} \] with probability tending to 1 as $D\to \infty$.
  When each $S_v $ is $\{1\dots D+1\}$, this is an asymptotically optimal version of the ``palette sparsification'' theorem of Assadi, Chen and Khanna that was proved in an earlier paper by the present authors.</description>

      <title>Key-avoidance for alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of key-avoidance on alternating sign matrices (ASMs) defined via pattern-avoidance on an associated permutation called the \emph{key} of an ASM. We enumerate alternating sign matrices whose key avoids a given set of permutation patterns in several instances. We show that ASMs whose key avoids $231$ are permutations, thus any known enumeration for a set of permutation patterns including $231$ extends to ASMs. We furthermore enumerate by the Catalan numbers ASMs whose key avoids both $312$ and $321$. We also show ASMs whose key avoids $312$ are in bijection with the gapless monotone triangles of [Ayyer, Cori, Gouyou-Beauchamps 2011]. Thus key-avoidance generalizes the notion of $312$-avoidance studied there. Finally, we enumerate ASMs with a given key avoiding $312$ and $321$ using a connection to Schubert polynomials, thereby deriving an interesting Catalan identity.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Polynomials and Hypergraph Generating Functions via Heaps of Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a classical result due to Jacobi in algebraic combinatorics that the generating function of closed walks at a vertex $u$ in a graph $G$ is determined by the rational function \[ \frac{\phi_{G-u}(t)}{\phi_G(t)} \] where $\phi_G(t)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $G$. In this paper, we show that the corresponding rational function for a hypergraph is also a generating function for some combinatorial objects in the hypergraph.
  We make use of the Heaps of Pieces framework, developed by Viennot, demonstrating its use on graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs before using it on hypergraphs. In the case of a graph $G$, the pieces are cycles and the concurrence relation is sharing a vertex. The pyramids with maximal piece containing a vertex $u \in V(G)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with closed walks at $u$. In the case of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, connected "infragraphs" can be defined as the set of pieces, with the same concurrence relation: sharing a vertex. Our main results are established by analyzing multivariate resultants of polynomial systems associated to adjacency hypermatrices.</description>

Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $n \ge s &gt; r$, a \emph{Tur\'{a}n $(n,s,r)$-system} is an $n$-vertex $r$-graph in which every set of $s$ vertices contains at least one edge. Let $T(n,s,r)$ denote the the minimum size of a Tur\'{a}n $(n,s,r)$-system.
  Upper bounds on $T(n,s,r)$ were established by Sidorenko~\cite{Sid97} for the case $s-r = \Omega(r/\ln r)$ (based on a construction of Frankl--R\"{o}dl~\cite{FR85}) and by a number of authors in the case $s-r = O(1)$. In this note, we establish upper bounds in the remaining range $O(1)&lt;s-r = O(r/\ln r)$.</description>

Abstract: Consider the normalized adjacency matrices of random $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices with fixed degree $d\geq3$. We prove that, with probability $1-N^{-1+{\varepsilon}}$ for any ${\varepsilon} &gt;0$, the following two properties hold as $N \to \infty$ provided that $d\geq3$: (i) The eigenvalues are close to the classical eigenvalue locations given by the Kesten-McKay distribution. In particular, the extremal eigenvalues are concentrated with polynomial error bound in $N$, i.e. $\lambda_2, |\lambda_N|\leq 2+N^{-c}$. (ii) All eigenvectors of random $d$-regular graphs are completely delocalized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.13346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generalizations of the Springer resolution of the nilpotent cone of a simple Lie algebra by replacing the cotangent bundle with certain other vector bundles over the flag variety. We show that the analogue of the Springer sheaf has as direct summands only intersection cohomology sheaves that arise in the Springer correspondence. The fibers of these general maps are nilpotent Hessenberg varieties, and we build on techniques established by De Concini, Lusztig, and Procesi to study their geometry. For example, we show that these fibers have vanishing cohomology in odd degrees. This leads to several implications for the dual picture, where we consider maps that generalize the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the whole Lie algebra. In particular we are able to prove a conjecture of Brosnan.
  As we vary the maps, the cohomology of the corresponding nilpotent Hessenberg varieties often satisfy a relation we call the geometric modular law, which also has origins in the work on De Concini, Lusztig, and Procesi. We connect this relation in type $A$ with a combinatorial modular law defined by Guay-Paquet that is satisfied by certain symmetric functions and deduce some consequences of that connection.</description>

      <title>Non-adaptive Bellman-Ford: Yen's improvement is optimal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bellman-Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths repeatedly updates tentative distances in an operation called relaxing an edge. In several important applications a non-adaptive (oblivious) implementation is preferred, which means fixing the entire sequence of relaxations upfront, independently of the edge-weights. Such an implementation performs, in a dense graph on $n$ vertices, $(1 + o(1))n^3$ relaxations. An improvement by Yen from 1970 reduces the number of relaxations by a factor of two. We show that no further constant-factor improvements are possible, and every non-adaptive deterministic algorithm based on relaxations must perform $(\frac{1}{2} - o(1))n^3$ steps. This improves an earlier lower bound of Eppstein of $(\frac{1}{6} - o(1))n^3$. Given that a non-adaptive randomized variant of Bellman-Ford with at most $(\frac{1}{3} + o(1))n^3$ relaxations (with high probability) is known, our result implies a strict separation between deterministic and randomized strategies, answering an open question of Eppstein. On the complexity side, we show that deciding whether a given relaxation sequence is guaranteed to yield correct distances is NP-hard, even with the complete graph as input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta \ge 3$ be fixed, $n \ge n_\Delta$ be a large integer. It is a classical result that $\Delta$--regular expanders on $n$ vertices are not embeddable as geometric (distance) graphs into Euclidean space of dimension less than $c \log n$, for some universal constant $c$. We show that for typical $\Delta$-regular graphs, this obstruction is universal with respect to the choice of norm. More precisely, for a uniform random $\Delta$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it holds with high probability: there is no normed space of dimension less than $c\log n$ which admits a geometric graph isomorphic to $G$. The proof is based on a seeded multiscale $\varepsilon$--net argument.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>
