      <title>Constructing and Sampling Directed Graphs with Linearly Rescaled Degree Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, many large directed networks such as online social networks are collected with the help of powerful data engineering and data storage techniques. Analyses of such networks attract significant attention from both the academics and industries. However, analyses of large directed networks are often time-consuming and expensive because the complexities of a lot of graph algorithms are often polynomial with the size of the graph. Hence, sampling algorithms that can generate graphs preserving properties of original graph are of great importance because they can speed up the analysis process. We propose a promising framework to sample directed graphs: Construct a sample graph with linearly rescaled Joint Degree Matrix (JDM) and Degree Correlation Matrix (DCM). Previous work shows that graphs with the same JDM and DCM will have a range of very similar graph properties. We also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to show that the numbers of non-zero entries in JDM and DCM are quite small compared to the number of edges and nodes. Adopting this framework, we propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that can provably preserves in-degree and out-degree distributions, which are two most fundamental properties of a graph. We also prove the upper bound for deviations in the joint degree distribution and degree correlation distribution, which correspond to JDM and DCM. Besides, we prove that the deviations in these distributions are negatively correlated with the sparsity of the JDM and DCM. Considering that these two matrices are always quite sparse, we believe that proposed algorithm will have a better-than-theory performance on real-world large directed networks.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>On a better complexity upper bound of Ward-Szabo theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ward and Szab\'o [WS94] have shown that a complete graph with $N^2$ nodes whose edges are colored by $N$ colors and that has at least two colors contains a bichromatic triangle. This fact leads us to a total search problem: Given an edge-coloring on a complete graph with N2 nodes using at least two colors and at most N colors, find a bichromatic triangle. Bourneuf, Folwarczn\'y, Hub\'acek, Rosen, and Schwartzbach [Bou+23] have proven that such a total search problem, called Ward-Szab\'o, is PWPP-hard and belongs to the class TFNP, a class for total search problems in which the correctness of every candidate solution is efficiently verifiable. However, it is open which TFNP subclass contains Ward-Szab\'o. This paper will improve the complexity upper bound of Ward-Szab\'o. We prove that Ward-Szab\'o is in belongs to the complexity class PPP, a TFNP subclass of problems in which the pigeonhole principle guarantees the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Nyldon Factorization of Thue-Morse Words and Fibonacci Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nyldon factorization is a string factorization that is a non-decreasing product of Nyldon words. Nyldon words and Nyldon factorizations are recently defined combinatorial objects inspired by the well-known Lyndon words and Lyndon factorizations. In this paper, we investigate the Nyldon factorization of several words. First, we fully characterize the Nyldon factorizations of the (finite) Fibonacci and the (finite) Thue-Morse words. Moreover, we show that there exists a non-decreasing product of Nyldon words that is a factorization of the infinite Thue-Morse word.</description>

      <title>Computational Verification of the Buratti--Horak--Rosa Conjecture for Small Integers and Inductive Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational approach to verify and inductively construct Hamiltonian paths for the Buratti--Horak--Rosa (BHR) Conjecture. The conjecture posits that for any multiset $L$ of $p-1$ positive integers not exceeding $\lfloor p/2 \rfloor$, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the complete graph $K_p$ with vertex-set $\{0, 1, \dots, p-1\}$ whose edge lengths (under the cyclic metric) match $L$, if and only if for every divisor $d$ of $p$, the number of multiples of $d$ appearing in $L$ is at most $p - d$.
  Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka, which verified the conjecture for all primes up to $p=23$, our Python program extends this verification significantly. We approach the problem by systematically generating frequency partitions (FPs) of edge lengths and employing a recursive backtracking algorithm. We report successful computational verification for all frequency partitions for integers $p &lt; 32$, specifically presenting results for $p=31$ and a composite $p=26$. For the composite number $p=30$, the Python code took approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. For $p=16$, $167,898$ valid multisets were processed, taking around 20 hours on Google Colab Pro+.
  Furthermore, we introduce and implement two constructive, inductive strategies for building Hamiltonian paths: (1) increasing the multiplicity of an existing edge length, and (2) adding a new edge length. These methods, supported by a reuse-insertion heuristic and backtracking search, demonstrate successful constructions for evolving FPs up to $p=40$. Through these empirical tests and performance metrics, we provide strong computational evidence for the validity of the BHR conjecture within the scope tested, and outline the scalability of our approach for higher integer values.</description>

      <title>Accumulator-Aware Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quantizing weights and activations to increasingly narrower representations, the cost of additions begins to dominate that of multiplications in multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. Recent studies show that reducing addition costs via low-precision accumulation improves throughput, power, and area across inference platforms, albeit with an increased risk of overflow. Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models and datasets continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, the first accumulator-aware quantization framework explicitly designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to PTQ algorithms. We present theoretical motivation for AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two existing algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We design AXE to support multi-stage accumulation, opening the door to full datapath optimization for the first time. We evaluate AXE using recent language generation models; when quantizing Llama3 8B for a 16-bit multi-stage accumulation datapath, AXE maintains up to 98% of the FP16 perplexity, surpassing naive bit width manipulation by up to 15%.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>

      <title>A note on the structure of locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an early work from 1896, Maschke established the complete list of all finite planar Cayley graphs. This result initiated a long line of research over the next century, aiming at characterizing in a similar way all planar infinite Cayley graphs. Droms (2006) proved a structure theorem for finitely generated planar groups, i.e., finitely generated groups admitting a planar Cayley graph, in terms of Bass-Serre decompositions. As a byproduct of his structure theorem, Droms proved that such groups are finitely presented. More recently, Hamann (2018) gave a graph theoretical proof that every planar quasi-transitive graph $G$ admits a generating $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$-invariant set of closed walks with only finitely many orbits, and showed that a consequence is an alternative proof of Droms' result. Based on the work of Hamann, we show in this note that we can also obtain a general structure theorem for $3$-connected locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs, namely that every such graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition whose edge-separations correspond to cycle-separations in the (unique) embedding of $G$, and in which every part admits a vertex-accumulation free embedding. This result can be seen as a version of Droms' structure theorem for quasi-transitive planar graphs. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof of a result of Hamann, Lehner, Miraftab and R\"uhmann (2022) that every locally finite quasi-transitive planar graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition, whose parts are either $1$-ended or finite planar graphs.</description>
