      <title>On a Theorem of Jiang and Rallis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form $x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial $x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach. Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.</description>

      <title>Maps preserving the sum-to-difference ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$, what are all functions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$? We solve this problem for the fields $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and a class of its subfields that includes the real constructible numbers, the real algebraic numbers, and all quadratic number fields. We also solve it over the complex numbers and on any subfield of $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous over the reals. The proofs involve a mix of algebra in all fields, analysis over the real line, and some topology in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>The Doeblin-Lenstra conjecture: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law, describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure.
  Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow, extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine statistics in both classical and fractal settings.</description>

      <title>Isolated $j$-invariants arising from the modular curve $X_0(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated point of degree $d$ is a closed point on an algebraic curve which does not belong to an infinite family of degree $d$ points that can be parameterized by some geometric object. We provide an algorithm to test whether a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated point on the modular curve $X_0(n)$, for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, using key results from Menendez and Zywina. This work is inspired by the prior algorithm of Bourdon et al. which tests whether a rational, non-CM $j$-invariant gives rise to an isolated point on any modular curve $X_1(n)$. From the implementation of our algorithm, we determine that the set of $j$-invariants corresponding to isolated points on $X_1(n)$ is neither a subset nor a superset of those corresponding to isolated points on $X_0(n)$.</description>

      <title>Partitions with Durfee triangles of fixed size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-studied statistic of an integer partition is the size of its Durfee square. In particular, the number $D_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee square of fixed size $k$ has a well-known simple rational generating function. We study the number $R_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee triangle of size $k$ (the largest subpartition with parts $1, 2, \ldots, k$). We determine the corresponding generating functions which are rational functions of a similar form. Moreover, we explicitly determine the leading asymptotic of $R_k (n)$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the meromorphic continuation of certain multiple zeta functions of generalized Hurwitz type. From this meromorphic continuation, we obtain explicit formulas for their (derivative) values at nonpositive integers along a given direction. As an application, we provide explicit formulas for some values and derivative values of the Witten zeta functions $\zeta_{\mathfrak{g}_2}$ and $\zeta_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}$. Furthermore, by employing a Meinardus-type theorem, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the number of $n$-dimensional representations of the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$.</description>

      <title>On the real zeros of depth 1 quasimodular forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the critical points of modular forms, or more generally the zeros of quasimodular forms of depth $1$ for $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. In particular, we consider the derivatives of the unique weight $k$ modular forms $f_k$ with the maximal number of consecutive zero Fourier coefficients following the constant $1$. Our main results state that (1) every zero of a depth $1$ quasimodular form near the derivative of the Eisenstein series in the standard fundamental domain lies on the geodesic segment $\{z \in \mathbb H: \Re(z)=1/2\}$, and (2) more than half of zeros of $f_k$ in the standard fundamental domain lie on the geodesic segment $\{z \in \mathbb H: \Re(z)=1/2\}$ for large enough $k$ with $k\equiv 0 \pmod{12}$.</description>

      <title>Local Intertwining Relations and Co-tempered $A$-packets of Classical Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local intertwining relation is an identity that gives precise information about the action of normalized intertwining operators on parabolically induced representations. We prove several instances of the local intertwining relation for quasi-split classical groups and the twisted general linear group, as they are required in the inductive proof of the endoscopic classification for quasi-split classical groups due to Arthur and Mok. In addition, we construct the co-tempered local $A$-packets by Aubert duality and verify their key properties by purely local means, which provide the seed cases needed as an input to the inductive proof. Together with further technical results that we establish, this makes the endoscopic classification conditional only on the validity of the twisted weighted fundamental lemma.</description>

      <title>Heavenly elliptic curves over quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An abelian variety $A/K$ is heavenly at $\ell$ if the extension $K(A[\ell^{\infty}])/K(\mu_{\ell^{\infty}}\!)$ is both pro-$\ell$ and unramified away from $\ell$. It is known that for a fixed quadratic field $K$, the number of $K$-isomorphism classes of heavenly elliptic curves is finite, even running over all primes $\ell$. We prove a complementary result, that for a fixed prime $\ell \geq 7$, there are only finitely many such classes, even running over all quadratic fields. We demonstrate similar behavior between heavenly elliptic curves and elliptic curves with complex multiplication, in terms of Frobenius traces modulo $\ell$. We conjecture a stronger finiteness statement based on these new results. Finally, we produce an explicit list of elliptic curves with irrational $j$-invariants that contains all heavenly elliptic curves with complex multiplication defined over quadratic fields, supported by overwhelming computational evidence that every curve on the list is heavenly. We include various extensions of our results to higher degree fields and higher-dimensional abelian varieties where possible.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969) and Central Limit Theorems were proved by several authors \cites{Ibragimov, Misevicius, Morita, Vallee}. In this work, we develop a new approach towards quantifying the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods apply to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). Further, we prove a Central Limit Theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Unlike previous approaches to the one-dimensional problem, our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavenly abelian varieties are abelian varieties defined over number fields that exhibit constrained $\ell$-adic Galois representations for some rational prime $\ell$. At the ICMS Workshop held in November 2024, we presented evidence for two finiteness conjectures around the distribution of heavenly elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, one in terms of isomorphism classes of curves, and a second in terms of quadratic fields which admit heavenly elliptic curves. We prove these two conjectures are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r,\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex valued, $|f|\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses. Let $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\tau$, the quantities $r(p)-\Re\{f(p)/p^{i\tau}\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses over the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent effective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the mean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\leqslant x$. We also provide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions and for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Difficulties Constructing Lattices with Exponential Kissing Number from Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present examples showing that several natural ways of constructing lattices from error-correcting codes do not in general yield a correspondence between minimum-weight non-zero codewords and shortest non-zero lattice vectors. From these examples, we conclude that the main results in two works of Vl\u{a}du\c{t} (Moscow J. Comb. Number Th., 2019 and Discrete Comput. Geom., 2021) on constructing lattices with exponential kissing number from error-correcting codes are invalid. A more recent preprint (arXiv, 2024) that Vl\u{a}du\c{t} posted after an initial version of this work was made public is also invalid.
  Exhibiting a family of lattices with exponential kissing number therefore remains an open problem (as of July 2025).</description>
