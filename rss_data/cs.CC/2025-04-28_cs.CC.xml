      <title>Geodetic Set on Graphs of Constant Pathwidth and Feedback Vertex Set Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the \textsc{Geodetic Set} problem, the input consists of a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$. The goal is to determine whether there exists a subset $S$ of vertices of size $k$ such that every vertex in the graph is included in a shortest path between two vertices in $S$. Kellerhals and Koana [IPEC 2020; J. Graph Algorithms Appl 2022] proved that the problem is $\W[1]$-hard when parameterized by the pathwidth and the feedback vertex set number of the input graph. They posed the question of whether the problem admits an $\XP$ algorithm when parameterized by the combination of these two parameters. We answer this in negative by proving that the problem remains \NP-hard on graphs of constant pathwidth and feedback vertex set number.</description>

      <title>Efficient witnessing and testing of magic in mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifting for Invertible Permutations and Ideal Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the first lifting theorems for establishing security in the quantum random permutation and ideal cipher models. These theorems relate the success probability of an arbitrary quantum adversary to that of a classical algorithm making only a small number of classical queries.
  By applying these lifting theorems, we improve previous results and obtain new quantum query complexity bounds and post-quantum security results. Notably, we derive tight bounds for the quantum hardness of the double-sided zero search game and establish the post-quantum security for the preimage resistance, one-wayness, and multi-collision resistance of constant-round sponge, as well as the collision resistance of the Davies-Meyer construction.</description>

      <title>P-time Algorithms for Typical #EO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the computational complexity of counting weighted Eulerian orientations, denoted as \#\textsf{EO}. This problem is considered a pivotal scenario in the complexity classification for \textsf{Holant}, a counting framework of great significance. Our results consist of three parts. First, we prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for \#\textsf{EO} defined by a set of binary and quaternary signatures, which generalizes the previous dichotomy for the six-vertex model. Second, we prove a dichotomy for \#\textsf{EO} defined by a set of so-called pure signatures, which possess the closure property under gadget construction. Finally, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for \#\textsf{EO} defined by specific rebalancing signatures, which extends the algorithm for pure signatures to a broader range of problems, including \#\textsf{EO} defined by non-pure signatures such as $f_{40}$. We also construct a signature $f_{56}$ that is not rebalancing, and whether $\#\textsf{EO}(f_{56})$ is computable in polynomial time remains open.</description>

      <title>Rank Bounds and PIT for $\Sigma^3 \Pi \Sigma \Pi^d$ circuits via a non-linear Edelstein-Kelly theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a non-linear Edelstein-Kelly theorem for polynomials of constant degree, fully settling a stronger form of Conjecture 30 in Gupta (2014), and generalizing the main result of Peleg and Shpilka (STOC 2021) from quadratic polynomials to polynomials of any constant degree.
  As a consequence of our result, we obtain constant rank bounds for depth-4 circuits with top fanin 3 and constant bottom fanin (denoted $\Sigma^{3}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{d}$ circuits) which compute the zero polynomial. This settles a stronger form of Conjecture 1 in Gupta (2014) when $k=3$, for any constant degree bound; additionally this also makes progress on Conjecture 28 in Beecken, Mittmann, and Saxena (Information \&amp; Computation, 2013). Our rank bounds, when combined with Theorem 2 in Beecken, Mittmann, and Saxena (Information \&amp; Computation, 2013) yield the first deterministic, polynomial time PIT algorithm for $\Sigma^{3}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{d}$ circuits.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Depth-4 PIT and Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of deterministic PIT for $\Sigma^{[k]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits over fields of any characteristic, where $k$ and $\delta$ are bounded. Our main result is a deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithm for $\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits, under the additional condition that one of the summands at the top $\Sigma$ gate is squarefree.
  Our techniques are purely algebro-geometric: they do not rely on Sylvester--Gallai-type theorems, and our PIT result holds over arbitrary fields.
  The core of our proof is based on the normalization of algebraic varieties. Specifically, we carry out the analysis in the integral closure of a coordinate ring, which enjoys better algebraic properties than the original ring.</description>
